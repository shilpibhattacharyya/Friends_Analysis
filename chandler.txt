 Chandler:You know I'd love to but I'm a little tired.
 Chandler:You're on!
 Chandler:He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups and then talk to his triceps.
 Chandler:She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
 Chandler:Wow!
 Chandler:How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
 Chandler:Anything?
 Chandler:You do realise that's your brother?
 Chandler:That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
 Chandler:Okay Buckwheat!
 Chandler:And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
 Chandler:(caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!
 Chandler:He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)
 Chandler:You got it!
 Chandler:Okay well we'll go back in there but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?
 Chandler:Enunciate!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Not quite. Monica's still at the salon and I'm just finishing packing.
 Chandler:You're not supposed to take that. Besides it's a New Testament what are you gonna do with it?
 Chandler:Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
 Chandler:I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
 Chandler:What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
 Chandler:Yeah it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
 Chandler:Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
 Chandler:You go back to work tomorrow night right?
 Chandler:So if you want people to see them then by definition you're not having them taken out... say at the break of dawn?
 Chandler:What are you singing?
 Chandler:It's Ride of the Valkyries from Apocalypse Now... See here's the thing The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home we don't have that problem anymore so if you think about it... I hate them!
 Chandler:Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
 Chandler:Again let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
 Chandler:Hit yourself in the tooth?
 Chandler:Honey you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?
 Chandler:Really? What happened?
 Chandler:You can't move at all?
 Chandler:If I untangle you will you please get rid of the corn rose?
 Chandler:(trying to untangle her) Some of these look a little frayed.
 Chandler:Now that I untangled you how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
 Chandler:I think you know.
 Chandler:This is what I want to do.
 Chandler:(Picks up the Miss Congeniality DVD) She's an FBI agent posing as a beauty contestant.
 Chandler:There's a hair in my coffee.
 Chandler:You know it's funny. Every time you say triplets I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
 Chandler:So a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room huh?
 Chandler:I mean you have a lovely home.
 Chandler:That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?
 Chandler:You want me to wash my hands first don't you?
 Chandler:Hey you must be Owen.
 Chandler:I'm Chandler. Hey I was in the scouts too.
 Chandler:Yeah in fact my father was a den-mother.
 Chandler:You know how to use a compass?
 Chandler:You do? That's fantastic!
 Chandler:I'd love to but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:I got nothing.
 Chandler:Where are Bill and Colleen?
 Chandler:We have to leave!!
 Chandler:I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
 Chandler:But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
 Chandler:See? Intuitive!
 Chandler:Which technically now you should give back!
 Chandler:I'm so sorry but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. Owen doesn't know he's adopted and he also thinks that Santa is real.
 Chandler:Owen didn't know he was adopted and Monica told him.
 Chandler:Yeah but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
 Chandler:I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. (Runs off.)
 Chandler:So you and Rachel tonight huh?
 Chandler:Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
 Chandler:What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
 Chandler:How can you be so confident?
 Chandler:Really? Like you have a routine?
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh in a funny and awkard way)
 Chandler:Oh I see what you mean that's quite nice. (They look at each other both embarassed)
 Chandler:...and beer!!
 Chandler:Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
 Chandler:She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Why...why?
 Chandler:Sure then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
 Chandler:Hey Pheebs!
 Chandler:Who's Amanda?
 Chandler:Are you trying to do a British accent?
 Chandler:Just so I know how many more of those can I expect?
 Chandler:No had it done to me though. Feels good !
 Chandler:Hello? Is someone on the line?
 Chandler:Hang on she’s right here. (he enters the living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone for ya.
 Chandler:(to Amanda) I get pedicures!
 Chandler:Hold on! There is something different.
 Chandler:Was that place... The Sun?
 Chandler:Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
 Chandler:How was your date with Joey?
 Chandler:You didn't like that?
 Chandler:(without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't know! (Monica just smiles)
 Chandler:If she asks I protested a little but ok!
 Chandler:Well aren't you a treat.
 Chandler:That fake British woman is a real bitch but she sure can dance... Hey!
 Chandler:Kinda... you know sneaking around having to hide from you guys...
 Chandler:Actually no. No it felt right. You know it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
 Chandler:I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)
 Chandler:Dude it's Chandler. Let me in.
 Chandler:I know I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
 Chandler:No I just had to get a picture of this.
 Chandler:I see you later!
 Chandler:Honey I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
 Chandler:Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
 Chandler:There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
 Chandler:Fine but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
 Chandler:Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
 Chandler:Oh sure she was probably up all night excited about the party she knows is happening.
 Chandler:I know what are we gonna do?
 Chandler:I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
 Chandler:To be fair this one does have nuts.
 Chandler:Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
 Chandler:We used to be married but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed and switches the camcorder off)
 Chandler:Was that Emma? Is she up?
 Chandler:I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
 Chandler:To the bathroom!
 Chandler:(Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and Joey come out looking shocked)
 Chandler:You do know I can just turn them the other way around right?
 Chandler:I'm begging you stop.
 Chandler:(Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
 Chandler:Thats a bear.
 Chandler:Ok on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
 Chandler:I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
 Chandler:They left.
 Chandler:I'm sorry is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
 Chandler:Emma you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old that's little.
 Chandler:Ooh! That's my girl!
 Chandler:Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
 Chandler:Me too...
 Chandler:There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
 Chandler:I was kidding.
 Chandler:No not yet.
 Chandler:Hey guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
 Chandler:Emma how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index finger again)
 Chandler:Let's do it come on!
 Chandler:Thanks!
 Chandler:Joey we would've asked you we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
 Chandler:So excited about your letter!
 Chandler:So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
 Chandler:That's where people make number two!!
 Chandler:(reading) I don’t... uh... understand.
 Chandler:On every word?
 Chandler:And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
 Chandler:You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus just write from here (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.
 Chandler:I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
 Chandler:Word!
 Chandler:She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a guy..?
 Chandler:Oh I don't think it was desperate I think it was amazing!
 Chandler:Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
 Chandler:Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
 Chandler:Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
 Chandler:It's ok it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)
 Chandler:(on the phone) Hello this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).
 Chandler:(Still looks confused) They loved it.
 Chandler:They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
 Chandler:She guessed 8 9 based on his drawings.
 Chandler:That sounds like fun.
 Chandler:I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) ... but I am wrong!
 Chandler:Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
 Chandler:Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
 Chandler:Hey I'm sorry I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.
 Chandler:(he enters) Hey honey!
 Chandler:Is Monica not here?
 Chandler:Oh then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
 Chandler:Yeah and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! (silence) Hell you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!
 Chandler:Oh... I don't know I really don't think you're right for the part.
 Chandler:First of all. Bravo. Uh but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
 Chandler:Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
 Chandler:Hey you guys.
 Chandler:Joe I told you you're just not right for the part.
 Chandler:Joe...
 Chandler:Fine!
 Chandler:Work Joe!
 Chandler:He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!
 Chandler:That's good! I liked it they didn't. (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey for God's sake go to work! (Joey runs away).
 Chandler:Hey Joe!
 Chandler:Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
 Chandler:(Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man.
 Chandler:(sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey continues to look at him suspiciously) But ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!
 Chandler:(looks surprised) What!? Of course I did!
 Chandler:I'm not lying to you I watched it!
 Chandler:I watched it!
 Chandler:(now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did!
 Chandler:(following him) I'm telling you I watched the tape. (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face)
 Chandler:In a sarcastic of course not!-tone) No!
 Chandler:I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
 Chandler:What did I just say?
 Chandler:Yes and I have to say I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
 Chandler:Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
 Chandler:He really is a chameleon.
 Chandler:Look I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.
 Chandler:I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
 Chandler:Lying is wrong!
 Chandler:I'm a pretty little girl.
 Chandler:That's funny we were doing the same thing!
 Chandler:Yeah it is really pricey. I mean I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
 Chandler:It was pretty simple actually I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you get married!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
 Chandler:You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
 Chandler:Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
 Chandler:(pointing at himself) Little people?
 Chandler:What...? NO!
 Chandler:(he stands up and he feels very offended) I don't and I'm offended by the insinuation!
 Chandler:I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine but that tape is not mine.
 Chandler:Ok ok here we go.
 Chandler:Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door and both are smiling exaggeratedly)
 Chandler:But you already gave all your money to charity!
 Chandler:I don’t think you can do that!
 Chandler:That’s sweet honey but save something for the adoption Lady.
 Chandler:Oh because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well not actually to death that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
 Chandler:But other than that... wholesome wholesome building.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Of course it was!
 Chandler:RAT BASTARD!
 Chandler:Oh it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with 
 Chandler:(Screams to interrupt Joey) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
 Chandler:Oh just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey bangs on 
 Chandler:WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
 Chandler:Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
 Chandler:(nervous smile) You can't make this stuff up!
 Chandler:What the hell are you doing?
 Chandler:Well we're not.
 Chandler:We don't have a code word.
 Chandler:Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously)
 Chandler:(escorting Joey to the door) You have to get out of here. You slept with 
 Chandler:Ok!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:And for the last time we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat)
 Chandler:I can explain... Joey...
 Chandler:Oh that's really ok.
 Chandler:Wrong number?
 Chandler:That's great!
 Chandler:Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
 Chandler:Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
 Chandler:Well it's just with uhm work and the stress of adoption we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
 Chandler:No no! We made this decision together.
 Chandler:Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
 Chandler:We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
 Chandler:Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
 Chandler:You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean we could be getting a baby soon!
 Chandler:Somebody is gonna pick us.
 Chandler:I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you me and the little Hemingway Bing. (pause) What he's my favourite author!
 Chandler:(after a long pause) The Firm?
 Chandler:You know you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
 Chandler:I'm serious let me do something just not the turkey or the stuffing nothing high profile.
 Chandler:Tell me more.
 Chandler:You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Hmm the game's at one.
 Chandler:Dinner is at four we'll never gonna make it back.
 Chandler:You say that now but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
 Chandler:Look Monica has been working hard all day she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place we shouldn't go!
 Chandler:Okay. (pause) And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
 Chandler:I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
 Chandler:(peeping) They're out there!
 Chandler:(peeping) Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says Rangers on it. They went to the game!
 Chandler:(looking through the peephole again) Ross' shirt is torn.
 Chandler:Yeah and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to Monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?
 Chandler:(relieved) Oh thank God!
 Chandler:(looking through the peephole) That's a lie you went to the game I can see Joey's hand.
 Chandler:Guys I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. (Monica looks at Chandler)
 Chandler:HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
 Chandler:Please let me stay on this side of the door.
 Chandler:The cranberries...?
 Chandler:He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him don't look at him! (They both look away)
 Chandler:The floating heads do make a good point.
 Chandler:Well you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late and you still went anyway.
 Chandler:That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
 Chandler:A little late for that.
 Chandler:Uhm we've got turkey grease.
 Chandler:Can you ever feel your ears?
 Chandler:(sarcastically) Oh I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
 Chandler:Okay look I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out okay? Okay so PUSH!
 Chandler:Come on guys PUSH!
 Chandler:My cranberries!
 Chandler:Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
 Chandler:(to Monica) Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
 Chandler:What's going on?
 Chandler:And?
 Chandler:Are you serious? (they hug)
 Chandler:That is the exact same thing.
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:We're just here to say goodbye we're off to Ohio.
 Chandler:And so incorrect!
 Chandler:Uhm thank you but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
 Chandler:Yeah. I mean this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
 Chandler:I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
 Chandler:So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
 Chandler:Yes but...
 Chandler:Oh screw it I'm gonna be a daddy!!
 Chandler:Yeah. Just weird you know. It's like Hi I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?
 Chandler:You're gonna be great.
 Chandler:Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
 Chandler:Ok.
 Chandler:That's what our friends call us.
 Chandler:(astonished) I don't think that's exactly...
 Chandler:So the fact that I am a doctor and my wife’s a reverend that’s important to you?
 Chandler:Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
 Chandler:Yeah wow.
 Chandler:No-ot for me it doesn’t.
 Chandler:Yeah actually. So you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
 Chandler:You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..
 Chandler:Yeah I did.
 Chandler:We are NOT signing those papers.
 Chandler:It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
 Chandler:You have gotta stop!
 Chandler:She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
 Chandler:Your Veal Chop is $3495!
 Chandler:But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
 Chandler:I know..
 Chandler:oh honey..
 Chandler:Monica I want a baby too but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to. 
 Chandler:So we'll tell the truth and who knows maybe she'll like us for us.
 Chandler:You're Jewish.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
 Chandler:I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
 Chandler:Well our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
 Chandler:Erica wait!
 Chandler:You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
 Chandler:Erica please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
 Chandler:But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
 Chandler:You still want that baby?
 Chandler:All right Joey be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
 Chandler:Sounds like a date to me.
 Chandler:Alright so I'm back in high school I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria and I realize I am totally naked.
 Chandler:Then I look down and I realize there's a phone... there.
 Chandler:That's right.
 Chandler:All of a sudden the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do everybody starts looking at me.
 Chandler:Finally I figure I'd better answer it and it turns out it's my mother which is very-very weird because- she never calls me!
 Chandler:Cookie?
 Chandler:Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?
 Chandler:And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
 Chandler:(imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!
 Chandler:(re TV) Ooh she should not be wearing those pants.
 Chandler:Please don't do that again it's a horrible sound.
 Chandler:Ooh this is a Dear Diary moment.
 Chandler:I'm sorry I didn't catch your name. Paul was it?
 Chandler:(deadpan) Yes and we're very excited about it.
 Chandler:It's a beautiful thing.
 Chandler:I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
 Chandler:I have no idea.
 Chandler:All finished!
 Chandler:Yes please don't spoil all this fun.
 Chandler:Oh God.
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:You must stop! (Chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)
 Chandler:Look Ross you gotta understand between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!
 Chandler:Stay out of my freezer! [Scene A Restaurant Monica and Paul are still eating.]
 Chandler:Angela's the screamer Andrea has cats.
 Chandler:That is amazing.
 Chandler:If can invade Poland there isn't anything I can't do.
 Chandler:Hi Paul is it?
 Chandler:All right kids I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers... it doesn't make much of a difference...
 Chandler:'Look Gippetto I'm a real live boy.'
 Chandler:You're right I'm sorry. (Burst into song and dances out of the door.) Once I was a wooden boy a little wooden boy...
 Chandler:And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
 Chandler:Oh how well you know me...
 Chandler:(as Rachel is cutting up her cards) Y'know if you listen closely you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
 Chandler:Did you make it or are you just serving it?
 Chandler:Kids new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. (Rachel sits down to hear Chandler's dream.)
 Chandler:Okay so I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
 Chandler:(looking at her) Seriously answer faster!
 Chandler:(to Phoebe) It's like a giant hug.
 Chandler:(picking up the phone) Hello.
 Chandler:Oh uhm... I have to work too. Yeah I'm stuck at the office all day.
 Chandler:Those are all really old!
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:I was in the car with Nancy all day.
 Chandler:Well at least the perfume is not mine be thankful for that!
 Chandler:It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.
 Chandler:And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) What were the things you said?
 Chandler:And the fireplace in the bedroom.
 Chandler:This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
 Chandler:I don’t know. What do you think?
 Chandler:I do too.
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:I don’t know what you mean giant talking cigarette! Oh by the way Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car so if she asks you I was at work all day.
 Chandler:We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean why upset everybody over nothing.
 Chandler:I know. Gooooood luck with it.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Is it me or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
 Chandler:Yeah (motions them to sit and they do) I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
 Chandler:...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
 Chandler:Actually we already found a house we love.
 Chandler:Bet you wish I was having an affair now huh?
 Chandler:I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
 Chandler:(goes towards Joey) You know that's not the reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)
 Chandler:Hey that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
 Chandler:If you win we give up the birds.
 Chandler:But if we win we get your apartment.
 Chandler:Dangerous Liaisons.
 Chandler:Fancy.
 Chandler:Fancy guest.
 Chandler:Thanks man.
 Chandler:Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
 Chandler:(To Monica) Wow! Listen we had a good run. You know what was it? Four? Five months? I mean that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So good-bye take care bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)
 Chandler:Well I think I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
 Chandler:Look we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay I'm in love with her.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey.
 Chandler:I know. (He kisses her.)
 Chandler:No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
 Chandler:Sure!
 Chandler:Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned but for me this has been really great you know I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway I was just thinking I mean if you'd gone to Vail and if you guys'd been with your family if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be all together you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
 Chandler:Here here!
 Chandler:Hello? It's Nancy they responded to our offer.
 Chandler:(to Nancy) Okay thanks... (to Monica) They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:That's okay we understand.
 Chandler:Yeah... Well it's a good thing we got it then.
 Chandler:We got the house.
 Chandler:I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
 Chandler:We're getting the house. (they hug) We're getting the house.
 Chandler:We're growing up.
 Chandler:So who's gonna tell them?
 Chandler:Not it! Damn it!
 Chandler:You'll see.
 Chandler:Well I didn't know how to tell you before but... We got the house.
 Chandler:What did I marry into?
 Chandler:You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
 Chandler:(to Monica) I'm leaving you.
 Chandler:Who?
 Chandler:(looking around) Did I go to this school?
 Chandler:(looks over at her) Sure nice.
 Chandler:You're right by saying nice I'm virtually licking her.
 Chandler:Are you asking permission to break the pact?
 Chandler:Awesome the name really stands out.
 Chandler:Man we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:You know our band is playing on Friday.
 Chandler:Fresh!
 Chandler:Mint!
 Chandler:I know it. You know I'm totally gonna ask her out.
 Chandler:I said it first bro.
 Chandler:(angrily) Look if you did...
 Chandler:Totally. I had sex in High school...
 Chandler:All right I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
 Chandler:All right so that's Missy Goldberg Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald who neither of us can go out with.
 Chandler:Oh and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
 Chandler:Well I officially give you permission to break the pact.
 Chandler:Your hands are shaking.
 Chandler:(to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and Ross move away from them). That didn't make us sound gay at all!
 Chandler:Ross that was 16 years ago!
 Chandler:I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (Ross just stares at him) All right look if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
 Chandler:Oh really?
 Chandler:Oh really!?
 Chandler:ADRIENNE TURNER!! (A girl behind them turns around)
 Chandler:Oh please and you knew how much I liked her.
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:Aren't you...?
 Chandler:(smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So how're you doing?
 Chandler:Hi Monica.
 Chandler:O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. (Goes off to find Ross.)
 Chandler:Well I did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) That's when I wrote the song Betrayal In The Common Room.
 Chandler:Look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
 Chandler:(smiling a little nervously) Hmm mmmhm..
 Chandler:(sighs) Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought who does Ross like the more than anybody?
 Chandler:Not her!
 Chandler:Soo... you girls having fun?
 Chandler:Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
 Chandler:Well maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
 Chandler:So where are you applying to?
 Chandler:I'm in college and I'm in a band.
 Chandler:Yeah but it was like a million years ago so it doesn't matter.
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:You kissed her that night too?
 Chandler:Seriously where did this happen?
 Chandler:Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
 Chandler:I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
 Chandler:Why would I kiss a girl and then put her on your bed?
 Chandler:What did I marry into?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner you know I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
 Chandler:No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
 Chandler:(to Rachel) You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
 Chandler:Heh.
 Chandler:This is like figure skating team all over again. (Phoebe and Ross glare at him astonished) I mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) I mean- I mean the balance beam. (to Ross) Help me!
 Chandler:Thank you.
 Chandler:I know I hate being left out of things.
 Chandler:Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
 Chandler:What happened?
 Chandler:(standing up too) M-Me-me-me!
 Chandler:Pick me I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
 Chandler:Oh I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
 Chandler:You are going downer!
 Chandler:(almost crying) I wouldn't know I didn't make it! (they hug)
 Chandler:Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
 Chandler:Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
 Chandler:Hey can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me you'll be getting some comedy!
 Chandler:Let me tell you why you need to pick me. (Goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. Rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) See when I was a kid I was always left out of everything you know and it really made me feel... insecure. You know I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway If I'm the only one left out of this wedding I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
 Chandler:(Getting up and raising his fist in victory) Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make groom for Chandler.
 Chandler:How's it going?
 Chandler:(smiling to himself too) That's what I was doing too.
 Chandler:You too.
 Chandler:Me too.
 Chandler:I'm not supposed to tell you.
 Chandler:You told us both we could be in the wedding? (they both stare at Rachel)
 Chandler:Rach Rach knock knock.
 Chandler:I'll tell you at the wedding.
 Chandler:So technically would this person be in the wedding?
 Chandler:I'm not scared. (moves towards Mike and Chappy) I'll just take little Chappy and... (he backs out) HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
 Chandler:(quickly) I'll do it.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Na ha ha... (to Chappy) Ne he he... (Ross moves Chappy to Chandler who quickly backs away) Ah ah...
 Chandler:(to Monica) Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
 Chandler:Oh yeah! (Monica walks outside)
 Chandler:Ready?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
 Chandler:You look beautiful.
 Chandler:That really was an incredible wedding.
 Chandler:I'd love to but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
 Chandler:I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
 Chandler:So where's Mike?
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Why are you wearing my apron?
 Chandler:Oh hey when she gets here is it ok if I introduce you two as my wife and the woman who's carrying my child? (she's not amused) No? Divorce?
 Chandler:Oh those places! There's always so many people their being corralled like cattle and... you know there's always some idiot who goes Mooooo!
 Chandler:I'm so sorry...
 Chandler:Monica. Calm self.
 Chandler:Why would you say that?
 Chandler:Great! (to Monica) This baby'd better to be really good.
 Chandler:(enters the room wearing an I love New York t-shirt a Statue of Liberty hat and carrying bags) New York is awesome!
 Chandler:Yeah I've been to these places before but I've never really seen them you know.
 Chandler:Oh uhm okay uhm do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
 Chandler:That's great.
 Chandler:So what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
 Chandler:I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
 Chandler:Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! (He turns the light on)
 Chandler:Honey it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
 Chandler:I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
 Chandler:I dunno aren't there tests for these things right?
 Chandler:Pff easy for you to say he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says mom on his shovel-wielding arm!
 Chandler:Hey! How was lunch?
 Chandler:(struggling) Oh really?
 Chandler:O-okay. (steps closer to Monica and speaks softly) So is she gonna take the test?
 Chandler:Oh God. It's shovely-Joe isn't it?
 Chandler:How do you know?
 Chandler:Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
 Chandler:(nods in appreciation) Shovely Joe!
 Chandler:Yeah I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
 Chandler:You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah like you wouldn't have done it. (she shrugs)
 Chandler:A dinosaur died a million years ago?
 Chandler:YOU NEVER DID IT!
 Chandler:Hey! I will have you know that... aah who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
 Chandler:Mrs Hannigan?
 Chandler:Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
 Chandler:Yeah come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
 Chandler:Damn it.
 Chandler:That's what we were gonna name the baby.
 Chandler:Hey how'd the interview go?
 Chandler:You know I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
 Chandler:That is a bad interview.
 Chandler:Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
 Chandler:To Ross!
 Chandler:And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said but thank you.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:When your head was hanging out the window it didn't hit a mailbox did it?
 Chandler:Man those two dogs are going at it!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Really? What changed your mind?
 Chandler:Joey there was a little girl who lived here but she died like 30 years ago.
 Chandler:Ha! I'm just messing with you.
 Chandler:You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
 Chandler:It's seven years ago. (he looks surprised) My time machine works!
 Chandler:Excuse me?
 Chandler:For your information I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
 Chandler:How did the job stuff go?
 Chandler:That's great!
 Chandler:How did the job stuff go?
 Chandler:Or facing a bitch of a commute.
 Chandler:My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (Monica looks at him and can't really place what he just said)
 Chandler:Well it makes me feel sad but...
 Chandler:I see.
 Chandler:Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
 Chandler:We close escrow tomorrow so seeing another house can only confuse us and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
 Chandler:What do you think Pheebs?
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:You're kidding!
 Chandler:Oh yeah?
 Chandler:I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
 Chandler:Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown I think we're okay.
 Chandler:It feels like we’re cheating on our house. And if we’re gonna cheat shouldn’t it be with like a hot younger house that does stuff that our house won’t do?
 Chandler:And yet I never run into Beyonce!
 Chandler:(at Janice's punching) Don't don't! (looks disgusted)
 Chandler:(To Monica and with bulging eyes) Why!?
 Chandler:This can not be happening!
 Chandler:The only way that that is going to happen is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
 Chandler:That is a great idea! And by the way I don't mean to sound distasteful but when did you start crapping money!?
 Chandler:Alright alright we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
 Chandler:Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and (apes Janice's voice) Oh My God!
 Chandler:(looks afraid but at the same time knows she's right) Well we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly outside) Oh that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)
 Chandler:The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
 Chandler:Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
 Chandler:Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
 Chandler:I never stopped loving you.
 Chandler:Yeah yeah yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
 Chandler:Now that you live next door we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
 Chandler:(stunned) Obviously.
 Chandler:Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
 Chandler:I understand.
 Chandler:(speaking as in pain) They're never coming down now.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
 Chandler:Where's your passport?
 Chandler:Well it's not.
 Chandler:We're taking a break!
 Chandler:Jumping on the bed?
 Chandler:No no no guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
 Chandler:(holding a pair of furry handcuffs) What the hell is this?
 Chandler:I didn't know Monica had these!
 Chandler:Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:I know she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. (Ross and Joey looks puzzled) I mean... oh forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
 Chandler:Yes Joe?
 Chandler:Oh yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
 Chandler:Oh yeah right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
 Chandler:Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
 Chandler:Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting! (he looks excited)
 Chandler:(he doesn't look excited anymore). Well played.
 Chandler:Uh Rach?
 Chandler:(to Rachel) Uh Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. (shows her the cuffs)
 Chandler:No no no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
 Chandler:Don't say Richard! Well if they're not Monica's and they're not yours then whose are they?
 Chandler:Pheebs!
 Chandler:I think these are yours.
 Chandler:Sure. (to Phoebe) You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
 Chandler:Let me just say something... Because once we get into this I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
 Chandler:Ooh not so tight... (blows raspberry and the hug ends) I'm sorry just give me one more chance.
 Chandler:I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't I can't.
 Chandler:Oh you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
 Chandler:That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
 Chandler:Mine was a humdinger
 Chandler:Well you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
 Chandler:Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
 Chandler:(to Joey) You couldn't be cool. (he goes to the guest bedroom)
 Chandler:Hey Mon I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
 Chandler:Well I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
 Chandler:Monica's grandmother.
 Chandler:Relax! We just get her some antacids.
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Honey it's gonna be okay.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Next time can I say breathe?
 Chandler:Where are you going?
 Chandler:You can't leave me alone with her.
 Chandler:This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
 Chandler:It's just that we've never spent any time you know alone together.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:So ah... Any plans for the summer?
 Chandler:Hah. May not wanna mention this. So you ever wonder which is worse you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
 Chandler:Well it's just interesting. You know because no one will ever know because no one can experience both.
 Chandler:One of life's great unanswerable questions. I mean who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
 Chandler:Is it really that bad?
 Chandler:I'm okay.
 Chandler:Alright. Wow that is one disgusting miracle.
 Chandler:Wow!
 Chandler:(emotional) It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
 Chandler:Well that's spongy.
 Chandler:I know. He has your eyes.
 Chandler:I mean I know that's not possible but he does.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:How do you feel?
 Chandler:Oh yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
 Chandler:Well gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
 Chandler:Interesting! (To Monica) Can I see you for a second?
 Chandler:What do we do?
 Chandler:(panicking) Twins! Twins!!
 Chandler:Uh-huh! Join me won't you?! Okay what do you say we keep one and then just like have an option on the other one?
 Chandler:Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion and then years later they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean that's a great day for everybody.
 Chandler:What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
 Chandler:Monica we are not ready to have two babies!
 Chandler:(smiles) Okay. Shhh...
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:(shocked) She? It's a girl?
 Chandler:(To Monica) Well now we have one of each! (To the doctor) And that's enough!
 Chandler:Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
 Chandler:Bye!
 Chandler:Have fun at church-camp!
 Chandler:I know! You ready to trade?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:We could trade later.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Her name is Erica.
 Chandler:Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
 Chandler:I love you.
 Chandler:I have no idea what's going on but I am excited!
 Chandler:We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift but now we understand you were doing this.
 Chandler:Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
 Chandler:Oh don't worry we'll find them.
 Chandler:Alright.
 Chandler:It's okay it's just an egg roll.
 Chandler:Okay let's find these birds.
 Chandler:Well that can't be good!
 Chandler:How?
 Chandler:Oh tons I'm quite the woodsman.
 Chandler:Joey wait! The ball!
 Chandler:I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
 Chandler:No... It's all glued together.
 Chandler:I don't know. Maybe.
 Chandler:I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
 Chandler:Did that movie ever get made?
 Chandler:And we're also gonna buy you tiny bird hearing-aids.
 Chandler:What's the matter?
 Chandler:I understand.
 Chandler:I don't know. Except that for one last time... (he touches the players as he says the following) Good game good game good game good game good game good game good game.
 Chandler:Well I can't do it either.
 Chandler:We have to bust it open but neither of us can do it!
 Chandler:That was... Impressive.
 Chandler:Sorry about the table man.
 Chandler:You gonna buy a new one?
 Chandler:Well at least we got these little guys out.
 Chandler:Aww we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand huh?
 Chandler:Hey you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
 Chandler:Yeah I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And plus here they'd have their own room.
 Chandler:You know I - I think you're set with the poultry.
 Chandler:I think there may be another reason. So awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
 Chandler:Wow this is weird.
 Chandler:Where's Ross?
 Chandler:(to his children) Look around you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place filled with love and laughter. But more important because of rent control it was a friggin' steal!
 Chandler:Oh okay.
 Chandler:Oh it's gonna be okay.
 Chandler:Sure. Where?
 Chandler:Yeah I think for us kissing is pretty much like an opening act y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
 Chandler:The problem is though after the concert's over no matter how great the show was you girls are always looking for the comedian again y'know? I mean we're in the car we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
 Chandler:Oh I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
 Chandler:Oh uh that would be mine. See I wrote a note to myself and then I realised I didn't need it so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead.
 Chandler:Yes and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
 Chandler:(looking out the window) Ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew!
 Chandler:Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
 Chandler:You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
 Chandler:...Dinah?
 Chandler:Now Monica you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
 Chandler:Boys? We're going in.
 Chandler:Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective huh Mon?
 Chandler:I mean presumably the biggest part of your job is done.
 Chandler:What does she do?
 Chandler:Well no although I did have an imaginary friend who... my parents actually preferred.
 Chandler:I dunno but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
 Chandler:Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
 Chandler:Yeah it's like when you're a kid and your parents put your dog to sleep and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
 Chandler:So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?
 Chandler:Hey that was really good!
 Chandler:Okay. So. Whaddya want from me Damone huh?
 Chandler:Smoke away.
 Chandler:I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
 Chandler:Relax your hand!
 Chandler:Not so much!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Alright now try taking a puff.
 Chandler:Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
 Chandler:It's fine it's fine. Look do you wanna get this part or not? Here.
 Chandler:Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it you feel right. You feel complete.
 Chandler:Nah not so much. Alright now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.)
 Chandler:Oh Satan's minions at work again...
 Chandler:I'm smoking. I'm smoking I'm smoking.
 Chandler:And this- is my reward!
 Chandler:Okay so this time I won't quit!
 Chandler:All right! I'm putting it out I'm putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe's coffee.)
 Chandler:What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
 Chandler:Oh yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties right? (Does the impression)
 Chandler:Yep we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
 Chandler:I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
 Chandler:Well maybe it's a contest y'know? Like collect all five?
 Chandler:Hey this is so unfair!
 Chandler:So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica with that snort when she laughs? I mean what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws why can't you accept me for this?
 Chandler:Hey y'know I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is smoking is cool and you know it.
 Chandler:Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey buddy what's up! Oh she told you about that huh. Well yeah I have one now and then. Well yeah now. Well it's not that big- ..well that's true.. Gee y'know no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well okay thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)
 Chandler:Ooh Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
 Chandler:Joey ate my last stick of gum so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
 Chandler:(deadpan) Ooh I'm alive with pleasure now.
 Chandler:(sarcastic) Oh she's sorry! I feel better!
 Chandler:...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
 Chandler:(leaving) I don't care I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
 Chandler:(returns) Yeah alright.
 Chandler:Uh if I were omnipotent for a day I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
 Chandler:You got waaaay too much free time.
 Chandler:Happy birthday pal!
 Chandler:Well aren't we Mr. The glass is half empty.
 Chandler:Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
 Chandler:(trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon Ross! You me Joey ice guys' night out c'mon whaddya say big guy (Pretending to punch him in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh?
 Chandler:(stops) I have no idea.
 Chandler:You got it.
 Chandler:(looking) Oh this is not that bad.
 Chandler:...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes it to Joey.)
 Chandler:We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
 Chandler:Yes Bunny?
 Chandler:(to Joey) Could've been a peach.
 Chandler:What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
 Chandler:(to Ross) See buddy that's all you need a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
 Chandler:He's open!
 Chandler:Hey look we're on that TV thing!
 Chandler:(to the receptionist)'Scuse me.
 Chandler:Listen it's kind of an emergency. Well I guess you know that or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
 Chandler:Excuse me look we've been here for over an hour and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks through it in a loud voice.) Oh c'mon Dora don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the waiting room.) Y'know I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back he turns and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-!
 Chandler:Yes the moon the glow the magical feeling you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here please?
 Chandler:Well what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
 Chandler:Then what?
 Chandler:So in your whole life you've only been with one—(He gets a look too)—oh.
 Chandler:I think it's great. Y'know it's sweet it's romantic...
 Chandler:No you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross enters off camera)
 Chandler:Oh I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on admit it! All things considered you had fun tonight.
 Chandler:You gotta do it man.
 Chandler:Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves)
 Chandler:Hello? Oh uh Rachel it's the Visa card people.
 Chandler:Alright. (on phone) Yes this is Rachel.
 Chandler:To the left to the left- aww! (They all collapse)
 Chandler:We can? All right I'm tryin' that.
 Chandler:So Saturday night the big night date night Saturday night Sat-ur-day night!
 Chandler:Not a one.
 Chandler:Oh right right shut up.
 Chandler:No I know but it's just so hard you know? I mean you're sitting there with her she has no idea what's happening and then you finally get up the courage to do it and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
 Chandler:Oh thanks but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
 Chandler:Ooh I hate when my father calls me that.
 Chandler:Oh. Well hold on camper are you sure you've thought this thing through?
 Chandler:It's just you and Rachel just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
 Chandler:Yuh-huh.
 Chandler:Well you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?
 Chandler:Oh and uh the fabric softener?
 Chandler:There you go.
 Chandler:Where are they? Where are they?
 Chandler:It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
 Chandler:Here we go.
 Chandler:Hey Janice.
 Chandler:Hey that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here please?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:(covering) What... did you get me there?
 Chandler:Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
 Chandler:That's great.
 Chandler:Well I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
 Chandler:That's it?
 Chandler:Oh yeah that hug looked pretty brutal.
 Chandler:Janice. Hi Janice. Ok here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
 Chandler:Here's the thing Janice. You know I mean it's like we're different. I'm like the bing bing bing. You're like the boom boom (Chandler flails his hand out and hits Janice in the eye)... boom.
 Chandler:Oh my god I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
 Chandler:(to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
 Chandler:Oh I don't know a million?
 Chandler:I'm fine.
 Chandler:I'm not fine. Here she comes.
 Chandler:How do you do that?
 Chandler:We should always always break up together.
 Chandler:I'm free! I'm free!
 Chandler:You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice no fear no sense of impending doom...
 Chandler:(staring at a woman across the room) Ross ten o'clock.
 Chandler:No ten o'clock.
 Chandler:(sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight nine ten o'clock!
 Chandler:She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short fat bald men!
 Chandler:Oh yeah and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
 Chandler:Oh please could she be more out of my league? Ross back me up here.
 Chandler:Thank you buddy.
 Chandler:Y'think?
 Chandler:Oh God I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
 Chandler:Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)
 Chandler:Hi.... um... okay next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name and uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.
 Chandler:Yes yes I did but what I didn't say was what I was about to say what I wanted to say was uh... would you like to go out with me sometime thankyou goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.)
 Chandler:(running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora and she's Italian and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh listen the usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)
 Chandler:Hey kids.
 Chandler:Well I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
 Chandler:It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
 Chandler:Alright. Once I got on the subway right and it was at night and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
 Chandler:We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
 Chandler:Oh I'm sorry so 'we' is?
 Chandler:Who's Rick?
 Chandler:Oh so you're divorced?
 Chandler:Oh I'm sorry then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
 Chandler:So tell me how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
 Chandler:Ethan? There's there's an Ethan?
 Chandler:So explain something to me here uh what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
 Chandler:...Hm.
 Chandler:What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
 Chandler:Well y'know I had some trouble with it at first too but the way I look at it is I get all the good stuff all the fun all the talking all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean this is every guy's fantasy!
 Chandler:Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
 Chandler:Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean she'll scratch your eyes right out.
 Chandler:Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
 Chandler:Oh no it's terrific it's... it's... y'know you deserve this after all your years of struggling you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
 Chandler:Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
 Chandler:C'mon we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom screams and runs back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!
 Chandler:Oh that would be Monica. Hey listen I wanna borrow a coupla things Aurora spent the night I really wanna make her breakfast.
 Chandler:Yeah well I only have twenty minutes until Ethan so y'know.. (He starts to raid the fridge.)
 Chandler:No no resentment believe me it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people so uh.. Monica can you help me with the door? (He has armloads of stuff.)
 Chandler:God I love these fingers...
 Chandler:No actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em look at how happy they are.
 Chandler:Oh no nonononononnononono don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her back down.)
 Chandler:Don't go.
 Chandler:(to himself) Too bad she's leaving.
 Chandler:Well I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
 Chandler:What Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
 Chandler:I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question but- And Andrew is?
 Chandler:Oh so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick Ethan and myself?
 Chandler:Well y'know most women would kill for three guys like us.
 Chandler:You.
 Chandler:Nono just you.
 Chandler:Lose the other guys.
 Chandler:C'mon we're great together why not?
 Chandler:...Well y'know part of me wants that but it's like I'm two guys y'know? I mean one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying y'know 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
 Chandler:I don't know I-I have to listen to both of them they don't exactly let each other finish...
 Chandler:...The second guy.
 Chandler:Sorry the first guy runs the lips.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Big guy?
 Chandler:Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
 Chandler:Oh great. This is just...
 Chandler:Oh my God it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
 Chandler:She's right it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh yeah that is the part to focus on you idiot!
 Chandler:Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
 Chandler:Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill I saw you with some guy last night. Yes he was some guy.
 Chandler:Alright alright alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God do something. Just make contact smile!
 Chandler:There you go!
 Chandler:You're definitely scaring here.
 Chandler:Yeah about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah thanks. (takes phone)
 Chandler:Hey it's me.
 Chandler:Yeah I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
 Chandler:I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
 Chandler:(angry) Put Joey on the phone.
 Chandler:I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
 Chandler:Yeah like that thought never entered my mind.
 Chandler:Um is it sugarless?
 Chandler:Oh then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note If Jill Goodacre offers you gum you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass you take it.
 Chandler:You know on second thought gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him a stick of gum and a strange look) 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice' or 'I'll have a stick' but no no no no. For me gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
 Chandler:(chewing gum) Ah let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm it's impish. Here we go.
 Chandler:Nice going imp. OK it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth.)
 Chandler:Good save! We're back on track and I'm... (grimacing) ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
 Chandler:(gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
 Chandler:OK.
 Chandler:Yes. Yes thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
 Chandler:Hi um I'm account number 7143457. And uh I don't know if you got any of that but I would really like a copy of the tape.
 Chandler:Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
 Chandler:Ah y'see perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent' or 'self-destructive'...
 Chandler:Yes please.
 Chandler:He's a he?
 Chandler:...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
 Chandler:You did?
 Chandler:Huh. Did uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
 Chandler:You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
 Chandler:Well this is fascinating. So uh what is it about me?
 Chandler:Ross is smart and funny d'you ever think that about him?
 Chandler:WHAT IS IT?!
 Chandler:Oh oh a quality good because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
 Chandler:I just have to know okay. Is it my hair?
 Chandler:Hey gorgeous.
 Chandler:No nono don't- don't worry about it. Believe me apparently other people have made the same mistake.
 Chandler:So uh... what do you think it is about me?
 Chandler:...Quality right great.
 Chandler:Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell that's who you saw me with?
 Chandler:Well yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
 Chandler:No! Uh I d'know! The point is if you were gonna set me up with someone I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
 Chandler:Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
 Chandler:Well don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that isn't it?
 Chandler:Nothing just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
 Chandler:You're watching a football game at a funeral?
 Chandler:You are a frightening frightening man.
 Chandler:Oh no-
 Chandler:Hi I'm Chandler and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Who are those people?
 Chandler:Hey Lowell.
 Chandler:So how's it going there in Financial Services?
 Chandler:Good good. Listen heh I dunno what Shelley told you about me but uh... I'm not.
 Chandler:Really.
 Chandler:So- you can tell?
 Chandler:So you don't think I have a a quality?
 Chandler:He is?
 Chandler:Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I wanted to get a Brian I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey Brian.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
 Chandler:That's so funny 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani man slash woman.
 Chandler:Do you know which one you're gonna be?
 Chandler:Good luck man. I hope you get it.
 Chandler:Yes every single one of them.
 Chandler:I thought it was $98.50.
 Chandler:I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact I'd very much like to butter your head.
 Chandler:All right I'm nine years old.
 Chandler:We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
 Chandler:Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
 Chandler:Tonight on a very special Blossom.
 Chandler:Oh you must stop shooping.
 Chandler:No I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
 Chandler:Ok we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing but that's not funny anymore.
 Chandler:The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
 Chandler:No no the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof who's with me?
 Chandler:Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
 Chandler:Do either of you have the keys?
 Chandler:(sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.
 Chandler:Ok Monica only dogs can hear you now so look the door's open. Here we go.
 Chandler:Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
 Chandler:Shall I carve?
 Chandler:Ok who wants light cheese and who wants dark cheese?
 Chandler:I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned but for me this has been really great you know I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway I was just thinking I mean if you'd gone to Vail and if you guys'd been with your family if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be all together you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
 Chandler:Here here!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
 Chandler:That's so funny 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani man slash woman.
 Chandler:Do you know which one you're gonna be?

So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
 Chandler:Here here!
 Chandler:Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
 Chandler:Y'know we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime HBO and Cinemax.
 Chandler:Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty thirty times! No?
 Chandler:Yeah well you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
 Chandler:You can say that because she's not your mom.
 Chandler:Shhh busy beaming with pride.
 Chandler:Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
 Chandler:THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
 Chandler:This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
 Chandler:...And then he burst into flames.
 Chandler:Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
 Chandler:Well I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
 Chandler:I know I am.
 Chandler:Myyy mother ladies and gentlemen.
 Chandler:What are you guys doing out here?
 Chandler:Okay you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside and shuts the door)
 Chandler:Oh my God.
 Chandler:I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:(To Joey) You knew about this?
 Chandler:I spent the entire day with you why didn't you tell me?!
 Chandler:(To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
 Chandler:Y'know of all my friends no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
 Chandler:I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)
 Chandler:I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
 Chandler:You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)
 Chandler:What was that?
 Chandler:Yeah I believe I was talking to Joey alright there Mother-Kisser? (Goes to the counter)
 Chandler:Yes well I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
 Chandler:Because it's complicated it's complex- Hey you kissed my mom!
 Chandler:That's very funny. We done now?
 Chandler:That would be no. Look just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me you can't talk to her.
 Chandler:No just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
 Chandler:You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
 Chandler:Really stupid.
 Chandler:Yeah. No. No...
 Chandler:Yeah okay.
 Chandler:Nice save.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Yeah why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.
 Chandler:Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
 Chandler:Pretty good! I told her.
 Chandler:No-no-no-no we're done.
 Chandler:And we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)
 Chandler:(to Ross) Ah it's just a weekend big deal!
 Chandler:Ok you're going to have to stop that forever!
 Chandler:You think?
 Chandler:Ok so it's just because it was my table I have to buy a new one?
 Chandler:What rule? There's no rule if anything you owe me a table!
 Chandler:Well I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
 Chandler:Well let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
 Chandler:What do you mean like buy it together?
 Chandler:You think we're ready for something like that?
 Chandler:Well it's a pretty big commitment I mean what if one of us wants to move out?
 Chandler:I'm not moving out.
 Chandler:Yeah yeah it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
 Chandler:It's just that we bought a hibachi together and then he ran off and got married and things got pretty ugly.
 Chandler:Aw don't do that
 Chandler:Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)
 Chandler:More coffee over here please!
 Chandler:So what are you gonna do?
 Chandler:Oh yeah you have to tell her.
 Chandler:That's patio furniture!
 Chandler:(gesturing towards another table) What about the birds?
 Chandler:You pick one.
 Chandler:Oh so forget about the birds but big red insects suggest fine dining!
 Chandler:Not like that I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey turns and gives Chandler a dirty look)
 Chandler:So what do you think?
 Chandler:I know!
 Chandler:What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy it's time for you to swoop in!
 Chandler:My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off into the distance. Joey wondering what they are looking at looks in the same direction)
 Chandler:Wha-
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Yeah get out!
 Chandler:(to Joey) One more game?
 Chandler:No-no-no-no we're done.
 Chandler:And we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)
 Chandler:(to Ross) Ah it's just a weekend big deal!
 Chandler:Ok you're going to have to stop that forever!

 Chandler:(to Joey) One more game?
 Chandler:Any contact?
 Chandler:Come on Ross you gotta get back in the game here ok? The Rachel thing's not happening your ex-wife is a lesbian—I don't think we need a third...
 Chandler:I think it's winning.
 Chandler:She'll love it. Go with the egg my friend.
 Chandler:No it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
 Chandler:Oh uh listen about tonight...
 Chandler:Yes I know but her friend sounds like such a...
 Chandler:Yes! Way to go man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg huh?
 Chandler:Oh uh I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok now remember no trading. You get the pretty one I get the mess.
 Chandler:...And what did you bring?
 Chandler:Janice?
 Chandler:(angrily) Hey it's Janice.
 Chandler:Ok I'm makin' a break for it I'm goin' out the window.
 Chandler:Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
 Chandler:I'm sorry I'm sorry you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and yells in his ear) Come on do it do it go come on!!!
 Chandler:That's OK.
 Chandler:(disgusted) What? What can't you do?
 Chandler:Tell me it's you and me we.
 Chandler:Ok you can not do this to me.
 Chandler:I hope she throws up on you.
 Chandler:So...
 Chandler:Oh what a crappy night!
 Chandler:Excuse me. (gets up jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?
 Chandler:Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
 Chandler:You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around it's a man) Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
 Chandler:That's right each. Oh and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always wanted to know...
 Chandler:No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye Janice.
 Chandler:Ok well this was very special.
 Chandler:Janice is gonna go away now.
 Chandler:Oh good Joey's home now.
 Chandler:How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
 Chandler:Oh man. In my next life I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
 Chandler:Hi Just Janice.
 Chandler:Is it loaded? Oh little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and Jan Forever.
 Chandler:Ok Janice. Janice. Hey Janice. Look there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
 Chandler:(surprised) It is?
 Chandler:Oh no you see actually it is.
 Chandler:Oh no I don't.
 Chandler:I did but...
 Chandler:Call me!
 Chandler:Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
 Chandler:Oh listen. If this is about those prank memos I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from the woman.) Nothing.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:So it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
 Chandler:So.... I quit.
 Chandler:Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
 Chandler:If I took this promotion it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
 Chandler:It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
 Chandler:Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
 Chandler:I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
 Chandler:Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
 Chandler:Thanks Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
 Chandler:Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
 Chandler:Well I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman career counselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the a-gogo.
 Chandler:Hey you guys all know what you want to do.
 Chandler:Hey you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
 Chandler:Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
 Chandler:Who are you going out with?
 Chandler:And he's not speaking metaphorically.
 Chandler:Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests intelligence tests personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.
 Chandler:Can you believe it? I mean don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
 Chandler:Ooh you know I had a grape about five hours ago so I'd better split this with you.
 Chandler:(tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...
 Chandler:You know I don't mean to brag but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. (dead silence) Amouz-bouche? (holds out tray)
 Chandler:(smiling)....with??
 Chandler:It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
 Chandler:Again?
 Chandler:(on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? (Listens) Yeah I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home you know? (Listens) Well that's very generous (Listens) er but look this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look Al Al... I'm not playing hardball here OK? This is not a negotiation this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No stop saying numbers! I'm telling you you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you on Monday! (slams the phone down)
 Chandler:Well?
 Chandler:Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)
 Chandler:Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of...
 Chandler:(walks away from window) OK that's enough of the view. Check this out look at this. Sit down sit down.
 Chandler:This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen could you come in here for a moment?
 Chandler:Thank you Helen that'll be all.
 Chandler:Last time I do that I promise.
 Chandler:(on phone) Yes Fran. I know what time it is but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh really really really? Well let me tell you something... you will care about it because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slams phone down then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa....
 Chandler:This is unbelievable. It’s been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon you’d be looking like a ham right about now.
 Chandler:It’s Phoebe! Hi!
 Chandler:Wait wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
 Chandler:Can we start over?
 Chandler:All right now look at her and tell me she doesn’t look exactly like her sister.
 Chandler:They’re twins!
 Chandler:You know that thing when you and I talk to each other about things?
 Chandler:Let’s not do that any more.
 Chandler:Your sister Ursula.
 Chandler:Yeah yeah she works over at that place uh...
 Chandler:Oh you do? Because she said you guys haven’t talked in like years.
 Chandler:Oh and I’ve got Earth Science but I'll catch you in Gym.
 Chandler:And (he imitates the buzzer) to you too Helen.
 Chandler:Oh okay. Send her in.
 Chandler:Hi Nina. Come on in.
 Chandler:Uh Yes. Yes. I’ve just been going over your data here and little thing you’ve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
 Chandler:Well it throws my WENUS out of whack.
 Chandler:WENUS. (Coughs) Weekly Estimated Net...
 Chandler:It’s not just that she’s cute okay. It’s just that... she’s really really cute.
 Chandler:(Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
 Chandler:Hey where you been?
 Chandler:Score.
 Chandler:Yeah listen. Okay before you do anything Joey-like you might wanna run it by err... (he indicates Phoebe who is helping Ross understand the remote control.)
 Chandler:Mr. D how’s it going sir?
 Chandler:And?
 Chandler:So what does this mean?
 Chandler:Hey listen I know I came in late last week but I slept funny and my hair was very very &ndash;
 Chandler:Nina? Nina. (He goes around his desk to where she is sitting.) Nina. (In pain) Nina.
 Chandler:(Looking down at her hand) Yes yes I am. Err listen the reason that I called you in here today was err... please don’t hate me.
 Chandler:(Suddenly bright) Would you like to have dinner sometime?
 Chandler:Well you still haven’t taken down the Christmas lights.
 Chandler:I’m just trying to find the right moment you know?
 Chandler:You know once you’re inside you don’t have to knock any more.
 Chandler:Wow this is serious. I’ve never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
 Chandler:Knit good woman knit knit!
 Chandler:And that’s the Chrysler Building right there.
 Chandler:Yes yes she is. Didn’t I memo you on this? See after I let her go err I got a call from her psychiatrist Dr. Flanen-nen Dr. Flanen Dr. Flan.
 Chandler:And err he informed me that uh she took the news rather badly in fact he uh mentioned the word frenzy.
 Chandler:Oh no no. Nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact if you asked her right now she would have no recollection of being fired at all none at all.
 Chandler:And yet believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself or others.
 Chandler:Well I guess that’s why they call it psychology sir.
 Chandler:You know Ross some scientists are now saying that that monkeys and babies are actually different.
 Chandler:Ah sure Nina. What’s up?
 Chandler:Oh well ah... maybe that’s because they’re ah... jealous of us.
 Chandler:Ah well maybe that’s ah because you’re getting a big raise.
 Chandler:Sure why not?
 Chandler:Oh you don’t know. (Presses a button.) Helen could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder’s raise?
 Chandler:Helen drinks. (Insincerely) Will you marry me?
 Chandler:Well I ended up telling her everything.
 Chandler:Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. (He holds up a bandaged hand.) Little tip if you’re ever in a similar situation never ever leave your hand... (he mimes Nina taking her revenge) ..on the desk.
 Chandler:You’re not gonna lose him.
 Chandler:What are you crazy? That's a baby!
 Chandler:Hey you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
 Chandler:Well only if you order stuff.
 Chandler:There it is! So what're you gonna do?
 Chandler:And your friend Phoebe?
 Chandler:Man if you tried something like that on my birthday you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
 Chandler:Alright what have we learned so far?
 Chandler:(Reading) Happy Birthday Peehe.
 Chandler:Did you see Betty?
 Chandler:Okay worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
 Chandler:Say your son never feels connected to you as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
 Chandler:You know you think I would.
 Chandler:What's up with the simian?
 Chandler:Okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?
 Chandler:No no you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
 Chandler:Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
 Chandler:We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
 Chandler:(Tapping Ross on his shoulder) So you feel like a dad yet?
 Chandler:Hey come on you came through you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
 Chandler:�Pudo aver sido General Tso! (It could've been General Sal!)
 Chandler:Well if you're gonna work for mechanics those are the ones to work for.
 Chandler:You know I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
 Chandler:Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
 Chandler:...little playthings with yarn?
 Chandler:Could you want her more?
 Chandler:(sarcastically) Dee the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
 Chandler:We're not—we're not saying anything.
 Chandler:(to the girls) We were playing poker alright...
 Chandler:And then he did.
 Chandler:There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
 Chandler:(teaching) OK so now we draw cards.
 Chandler:OK Phoebs how many do you want?
 Chandler:(changing subject) OK so at this point the dealer...
 Chandler:OK alright last minute lesson last minute lesson. (holds up two cards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright babe deal the cards.
 Chandler:Rach Rach we gotta settle.
 Chandler:The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see King George is giving us the land so...
 Chandler:Yes and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself but they cost a little less.
 Chandler:Oh did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
 Chandler:Oh come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking) When I play poker I'm not a nice guy!
 Chandler:Um ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
 Chandler:Oh yes yes we could play some other game... like uh I don't know... Pictionary?
 Chandler:That's alright I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
 Chandler:Hey that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
 Chandler:Couldn't be more out. (throws in cards)
 Chandler:Y'know I've had dates like this.
 Chandler:Call.
 Chandler:(to Ross) What do you need what do you need?
 Chandler:Alright here's ten. (gives it to him)
 Chandler:Good luck.
 Chandler:(to Ross) I thought we had them!
 Chandler:Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
 Chandler:Go.
 Chandler:Toootal chick-flick.
 Chandler:They're still just friends right?
 Chandler:I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
 Chandler:I mean don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel they would've happened already?
 Chandler:I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
 Chandler:Hey y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's when that phrase was last used.
 Chandler:Rachel lost Marcel.
 Chandler:Okay it's his first time out so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats you go to the Russian Tea Room.
 Chandler:Marcel?
 Chandler:Marcel?
 Chandler:Um we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
 Chandler:Yes have you seen any?
 Chandler:Oh nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
 Chandler:Yes but these women are very hot and they need our help! And they're very hot.
 Chandler:Okay from now on you don't get to talk to other people.
 Chandler:Marcel?!
 Chandler:Eh. I thought that was an alp.
 Chandler:Yeah well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
 Chandler:I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
 Chandler:I feel violated. And not in a good way.
 Chandler:I am telling you years from now schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves we didn't have to play any games...
 Chandler:Let her know I like her? What are you insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm right right?
 Chandler:Which by the way is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.
 Chandler:No interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase Yes indeedy-o.
 Chandler:(bluffing) And basically that's how a bill becomes a law.
 Chandler:Hey Rach!
 Chandler:Yes!
 Chandler:I have my reasons.
 Chandler:(on phone reading from a script) Oh Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God!
 Chandler:Hey I've been honing!
 Chandler:Oh uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
 Chandler:What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
 Chandler:Can I use your phone?
 Chandler:Yes it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
 Chandler:Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
 Chandler:Ah you obviously saw my personal ad.
 Chandler:She answered.
 Chandler:I'm not gonna talk to her she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God I miss just being needy.
 Chandler:If it helps I could slide over.
 Chandler:Hello? Hello?
 Chandler:So how's Mindy?
 Chandler:Hell is filled with people like you.
 Chandler:...And boogie!
 Chandler:Okay I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
 Chandler:Hey we haven't been on a second date she needs to hear me pee?
 Chandler:I can't call her I left a message! I have some pride.
 Chandler:No! (Calls) Danielle hi! It's uh it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine. Uh listen I don't know if you tried to call me because uh idiot that I am I accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh uh okay that's fine that's great. (Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line she's gonna call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line she's gonna call me back she's on the other line gonna call me back...
 Chandler:'S'why I'm dancing...
 Chandler:Ring dammit ring!
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:(investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God I turned it off!
 Chandler:Nngghhh!!!!!!!
 Chandler:Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody this is Danielle Danielle everybody.
 Chandler:What are you doing here?
 Chandler:...I'm I'm okay.
 Chandler:That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me whatever...
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:...I dunno.
 Chandler:Well she seems very nice and everything but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here just to see if I was okay? I mean... how needy is that?
 Chandler:Wow what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
 Chandler:Well that's what we said about Joey...
 Chandler:How about Joey... Pepponi?
 Chandler:Joey... Switzerland?
 Chandler:Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
 Chandler:Well it does not ring a bell with me...
 Chandler:Might wanna try Joseph.
 Chandler:Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
 Chandler:She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones is she?
 Chandler:So what does this mean?
 Chandler:I don't get it I mean you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
 Chandler:I know that one! ...No that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
 Chandler:Yeah but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean it's a total party zoo.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
 Chandler:...Take off their hats!
 Chandler:You're kidding.
 Chandler:Y'know you'd think I would've.
 Chandler:...He's in.
 Chandler:Okay bye champ. Now I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego but remember there's also a lot to learn.
 Chandler:Tell me what?
 Chandler:(sarcastically) Oh come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
 Chandler:Wow!
 Chandler:More importantly was I any good?
 Chandler:Interesting cause in my dreams I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. (Monica pats him on his lap)
 Chandler:You're okay there?
 Chandler:I'm sorry it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
 Chandler:Hello Rachel.
 Chandler:Pirates again?
 Chandler:(sarcasticly) Thanks Joey that's a good idea.
 Chandler:Well my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It's a whole big boob story.
 Chandler:Well you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
 Chandler:A cool phone number and a possible name for the kid.
 Chandler:When we were?
 Chandler:Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
 Chandler:Can you hear that?
 Chandler:See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
 Chandler:I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Ah!
 Chandler:Well now I actually have to get to work.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Bye bye.
 Chandler:(answering it) Yes?
 Chandler:Ooh. (leans against the desk)
 Chandler:See it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonder what he means) Me.
 Chandler:Why not?
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
 Chandler:What are you talking about?
 Chandler:I can't belive it.
 Chandler:They do me?
 Chandler:I don't sound like that.
 Chandler:Okay I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
 Chandler:That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh shut up!
 Chandler:Oh come on. You told me about the last dream.
 Chandler:Oh why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
 Chandler:And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
 Chandler:Tyrannosaurus!
 Chandler:Work people? Nobody told me.
 Chandler:You know I don't get this. A month ago these people were my friends. You know just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
 Chandler:You think I should?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:I Think last night was great. You know the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Then I don't get it.
 Chandler:They do?
 Chandler:I just wan't to...
 Chandler:But I just wa...
 Chandler:Thanks. Listen about the weekly numbers I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
 Chandler:You have to give 'em something you know. Okay now that was Gerston Santos and who's the guy with the moustache?
 Chandler:Petrie right right. Okay some people gonna be working this weekend.
 Chandler:(doing a little dance) Hey Ross look what I've got going here.
 Chandler:Yeah like in a cab...
 Chandler:Okay hating this.
 Chandler:Here we go here we go.
 Chandler:Yes Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
 Chandler:You have to pick your moments.
 Chandler:I used to have that bumper sticker.
 Chandler:(to Rachel) You see what I mean.
 Chandler:Mmmm. Not tonight honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
 Chandler:Oh ok 'cause we never do that.
 Chandler:You'll get one.
 Chandler:All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40 if neither one of us are married what do you say you and I get together and have one?
 Chandler:Oh no no. I just meant hypothetically.
 Chandler:No no no.
 Chandler:(trapped) Uh uh.
 Chandler:Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
 Chandler:Rachel what is the deal with you and doctors anyway? Was like your father a doctor?
 Chandler:No reason. (turns around makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with his eyes)
 Chandler:Where have you been?
 Chandler:Mazel tov!
 Chandler:(to Joey) You are really frightening me.
 Chandler:Somebody wanna help me tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her hand off of him) Uh that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?
 Chandler:(to nurse) Let me ask you do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
 Chandler:I know I still am one of these.
 Chandler:And sometimes I'll want you to steal third and I'll go like this. (Does a baseball sign.)
 Chandler:Nothing just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks over to where Joey is seated)
 Chandler:Oh yeah right OK... inlcuding the waffles last week you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
 Chandler:(sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)
 Chandler:(in a deep voice) Men are here.
 Chandler:Then put out fire by peeing no get invited back.
 Chandler:Crazy bitch.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Uh let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
 Chandler:Forget about her.
 Chandler:Course there they just call it food.
 Chandler:I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
 Chandler:(sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)
 Chandler:(pointing out a gift) OK this one right here is from me.
 Chandler:Yes the doctors say if they remove it he'll die.
 Chandler:Oh that's Ross's.
 Chandler:Well sure but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel Scrabble game)
 Chandler:Come on Ross? Remember back in college when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
 Chandler:(panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.
 Chandler:(stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
 Chandler:(rubbing his temples) Oh no-no-no-no-no....
 Chandler:No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
 Chandler:OK is there a mute button on this woman?
 Chandler:(quickly) H-He's in China!
 Chandler:What about the time difference?
 Chandler:Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!
 Chandler:Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
 Chandler:Rachel I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)
 Chandler:Hey big...
 Chandler:(quietly) ...spender.
 Chandler:So how'd it go?
 Chandler:The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
 Chandler:Yes I know as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
 Chandler:I didn't know you had another level.
 Chandler:Alright you did it! Do we have any fruit?
 Chandler:Really? So you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
 Chandler: No way!
 Chandler:Yes yes we did thanks to Vidal Buffay.
 Chandler:Ok I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick get the verbs.
 Chandler:Well listen don't tell us what's gonna happen though 'cause I like to be surprised.
 Chandler:Hey Rach can I get...
 Chandler:Not yet.
 Chandler:So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean when last we left you you were totally in love with you know.
 Chandler:God?
 Chandler:Well maybe it was God doing me.
 Chandler:Well you owe me one big guy.
 Chandler:He said...he said he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But the silver lining if you wanna see it is that he made the decision all by himself!  Without any outside help whatsoever.
 Chandler:You have to really wanna see it.
 Chandler:(entering) Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
 Chandler:No no I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
 Chandler:Okay.  You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
 Chandler:Ok I don't care what you guys say something's bothering her.
 Chandler:What stupid thing did you do?
 Chandler:People do stupid things when they're upset.
 Chandler:Well in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension I've got pants that need to be altered.
 Chandler:Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
 Chandler:At least as long as I have the pants.
 Chandler:(entering angry) Yo paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? (Pause) Your tailor is a very bad man!
 Chandler:Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
 Chandler:Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam and he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite...
 Chandler:Cupping.
 Chandler:Come on Monica things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy but it's true.
 Chandler:That's ok.
 Chandler:You know it's... (sees the feeding taking place next to him) something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. (Goes into the kitchen)
 Chandler:We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
 Chandler:Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
 Chandler:So uh how often can you do it?
 Chandler:Hey sweetums.
 Chandler:Come on you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
 Chandler:What did you just do?
 Chandler:What did you just do?
 Chandler:Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
 Chandler:Howdy.
 Chandler:Well maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
 Chandler:(slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
 Chandler:(pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
 Chandler:You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
 Chandler:All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Huh. (They all leave dejected)
 Chandler:Morning.
 Chandler:Yeah like there's any way I could ever do that.
 Chandler:Hey you know what here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
 Chandler:I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
 Chandler:Well maybe I won't kiss you and then you'll have to stay.
 Chandler:Nope not this time.
 Chandler:I'm not yanking you.
 Chandler:Yeah I know. She makes me happy.
 Chandler:(looks him in the eye) I'm not breaking up with her! (they stare at each other for a while then Joey blows in his face)
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Of!
 Chandler:You know you should really go on this show. All right listen I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
 Chandler:No Janice.
 Chandler:You know I may be way out on a limb here but do you do you have a problem with Janice?
 Chandler:Ooh that girl that I hate eww drives me crazy eww eww oh!
 Chandler:Well there you go.
 Chandler:Well I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry those are the right letters.
 Chandler:I want you to say that you like her!
 Chandler:Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
 Chandler:Umm yeah.
 Chandler:Girth? Why why why wh-why why why why would they do this?
 Chandler:We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
 Chandler:Yeah okay.
 Chandler:Yeah! All right! You go first.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
 Chandler:I know!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Okay you know you know when your in bed with a woman.
 Chandler:And ah you know your fooling around with her. And you get all these like mental images in your brain you know like Elle MacPherson or that girl at the Xerox place....
 Chandler:I know And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom get outta here!' You know but of course like after that you can't possibly think of anything else and you can't you know stop what your doing. So it's kinda like you're you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!
 Chandler:You said...
 Chandler:What are you guys doing together?
 Chandler:Really.
 Chandler:You still can't stand her can you?
 Chandler:Well you know I appreciate you giving it a shot.
 Chandler:Well I guess that's something.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Oh God!
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:Taste it.
 Chandler:Yeah I know I did that two minutes ago.
 Chandler:Hey mister tux!
 Chandler:(entering from bathroom with an issue of Cosmo) All right I took the quiz and it turns out I do put career before men. (to Joey) Get up.
 Chandler:You're in my seat.
 Chandler:'Cause I was sitting there.
 Chandler:Well it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom you knew I was coming back.
 Chandler:The big deal is I was sitting there last so that's my seat.
 Chandler:All right Ross I just have to do one thing really quickly it's not a big deal. (yells at Joey) GET UP!!
 Chandler:Well Joey I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
 Chandler:Really!
 Chandler:Honey you did call him back. 'Cause it's it's really old.
 Chandler:You know what okay fine. Don't get up you just sit right there. I just hope you don't mind you know my hand right here. (holds his hand a couple of inches in front of Joey's face) Op not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! (Joey flings some dip onto Phoebe's dress)
 Chandler:Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
 Chandler:All right fine you know what we'll both sit in the chair. (sits on Joey's lap) I'm soooo comfortable.
 Chandler:All right! (jumps up)
 Chandler:All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair! (leaves)
 Chandler:Maybe it was his sister's. You know maybe it was his daughter's.
 Chandler:All right you will notice that I am fully dressed. I in turn have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne Get out of my chair dillhole!
 Chandler:What are you doing?
 Chandler:The cushions are the essence of the chair!
 Chandler:Oh-ho it'll be back. Oh-ho there's nobody in the room.
 Chandler:We used them as pillows when we went camping.
 Chandler:(shyly) The sheep.
 Chandler:He took my essence!
 Chandler:Well then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
 Chandler:What are you what are you gonna show me my clothes?
 Chandler:He's got nothing!
 Chandler:What are you supporting?
 Chandler:Monica I think you've gone over to the bad place.
 Chandler:(to Phoebe) You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower he always put a towel around his waist. I mean what is that about?
 Chandler:They got a phone in there right?
 Chandler:Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
 Chandler:Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
 Chandler:Oooo-ooh!
 Chandler:Jeez what a baby.
 Chandler:Stop it. Stop it!
 Chandler:Excuse me. Hi.
 Chandler:Well your kind of sitting in my seat.
 Chandler:I mean I was sitting there.
 Chandler:But I never left the room!
 Chandler:All right that's it give me your underwear.
 Chandler:(going to the bedroom) See Joe that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Well I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
 Chandler:Because the kids need new shoes.
 Chandler:Do I look fat?
 Chandler:Okay I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
 Chandler:Okay well. Janice said 'Hi do I look fat today?' And I I looked at her....
 Chandler:Okay so you both just know this stuff?
 Chandler:That's easy baggage claim.
 Chandler:Okay this is good this is good. All right listen I have one. Janice likes to cuddle at night which you know I'm all for. But uh you know when you want to go to sleep you want some space. So uh how do I tell her that without you know accidentally calling her fat or something.
 Chandler:Thank you Rachel.
 Chandler:Well I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
 Chandler:Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Okay the old hug and roll.
 Chandler:Okay one question.
 Chandler:You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
 Chandler:Umm not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
 Chandler:Hey Joe I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds up one hand) or or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)
 Chandler:Well your gonna need much bigger jars.
 Chandler:That that's what's stupid.
 Chandler:Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'Look at all that room on her side you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay hug and roll time. I'm huggin' I'm huggin' your rollin' and....yes! Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay time for the old table cloth trick one fluid motion. Quick like a cat quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!' (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)
 Chandler:No that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
 Chandler:You mean there's more than one of us.
 Chandler:And that's how you bought it?
 Chandler:Pheebs wake up and smell the restraining order.
 Chandler:Sure. What's up?
 Chandler:You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
 Chandler:Well it's official there are no good movies.
 Chandler:Hey man. What's up?
 Chandler:Well I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt but ah it wasn't me.
 Chandler:Is anybody else scared?
 Chandler:Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
 Chandler:(entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
 Chandler:Just do it! Okay it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
 Chandler:Okay last night at dinner when the meals came she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
 Chandler:Noo.
 Chandler:No it's like all of the sudden we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
 Chandler:I know that (looks at her fake chest and loses his train of thought temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
 Chandler:Look what do I do? I wanna get past this I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel to the other side!
 Chandler:Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do we have any thoughts here?
 Chandler:You think?
 Chandler:Yeah Joe I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
 Chandler:'Cause I wanted to uh give you this. (hands her a present)
 Chandler:Well wait there's there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
 Chandler:Yes I did. Yes I did. Because you're my girlfriend and that's what girlfriends should should get.
 Chandler:Well not me. But that's what's happened and ah and and there's more. We should take a trip.
 Chandler:Yep we're a couple and that's what couples do. And I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
 Chandler:I am I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
 Chandler:It doesn't scare me!
 Chandler:Oh no no no don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless and awkward and desperate for love!! (Janice leaves Chandler then calls Janice to leave a message on her machine) Hey Janice! It's me. Um yeah I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)
 Chandler:So I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
 Chandler:Then I got all needy and clingy.
 Chandler:She said she'd call me.
 Chandler:Oh God.
 Chandler:This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
 Chandler:So you don't think I'm terminal?
 Chandler:Okay okay. So should I call her?
 Chandler:So I'm not not gonna lose her?
 Chandler:I said 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
 Chandler:(in a British accent) Hello Janice.
 Chandler:(in accent) Oh just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
 Chandler:(normal voice) No. Not anymore.
 Chandler:Yeah huh. I'm just uh you know I'm just picking up some things for a party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)
 Chandler:Well I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
 Chandler:Here in Chelsea.
 Chandler:A woman's
 Chandler:(shyly) Chelsea.
 Chandler:Can I be that guy?
 Chandler:....And then I just you know threw the bag of barley at her and ran out of the store.
 Chandler:I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now right?
 Chandler:(answering phone) Hello. Hi Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay what do I do?
 Chandler:Hello!
 Chandler:What are you stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello Janice. Hi I'm so glad that you called I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And it's just because I'm crazy about you and I just got...stupid and and scared and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. (listens) Really?! (listens) Really?!

 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:You’re building a post office?
 Chandler:Okay. (notices that Joey is wearing some really tight jeans) My word! Those are snug.
 Chandler:Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
 Chandler:All right Janice likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
 Chandler:Well we have a deal where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with and the other one can’t get mad.
 Chandler:Ah Kim Basinger Cindy Crawford Halle Berry Yasmine Bleeth and ah Jessica Rabbit.
 Chandler:I know I know I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
 Chandler:Peter Parker.
 Chandler:(coughing) What a geek!
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:We don’t really.
 Chandler:You know we don’t really take advantage of living in the city.
 Chandler:No you didn’t get me!! It’s an electric drill you get me you kill me!!
 Chandler:I do NOT want this unit!!
 Chandler:Fine! (goes into his room and slams the door then he slams the bottom half of the door.)
 Chandler:All right so who do you got it narrowed down to?
 Chandler:Oooh-hoo very attractive forgiving.
 Chandler:Eh y'know what she’s to political she probably wouldn’t let you do it unless you donated four cans of food first.
 Chandler:Ooh-hoo. Very hot very sexy. But ah y'know she’s too international y'know she’s never gonna be around.
 Chandler:So you gotta play the odds pick somebody who’s gonna be in the country like all the time.
 Chandler:(entering) Have you seen Joey?
 Chandler:Oh just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of his pants.) Y’know what it’s my fault really because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
 Chandler:What’s going on?
 Chandler:Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
 Chandler:He started mine first!
 Chandler:What like a number?
 Chandler:Hi! Bye! (runs to the bathroom)
 Chandler:Okay on three. One....Two....
 Chandler:Why two?
 Chandler:Yeah I coulda counted to three like four times without all this ‘two’ talk.
 Chandler:Okay one...two...
 Chandler:Oh good job Joe.
 Chandler:Yeah-yeah so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
 Chandler:Yeah y'know what I got a better idea. How-how ‘bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move it but it doesn’t move.)
 Chandler:Umm?
 Chandler:I’ve got five bucks says you can’t.
 Chandler:Oh I think I have the cash.
 Chandler:Yeah you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so that the doors won’t open) I’m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack between the door and frame) Here you go.

 Chandler:I’m never gonna find a roommate ever.
 Chandler:Well let’s see there was the guy with the ferrets that’s plural. The spitter. Oh-ho and yes the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing Bing!
 Chandler:Two. This photographer who seemed really dull. And this actor guy who I’m not sure about because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa short message.’
 Chandler:Umm how’s it going with you guys?
 Chandler:Soo ah Eric what kind of photography do ya do?
 Chandler:Yes that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
 Chandler:Well listen I ah still have one more person to ah meet but unless it turns out to be your sister I think you’re chances are pretty good. (Eric offers to shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)
 Chandler:(running around the apartment pointing out things) Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen and thanks for coming by (opens door) Bye-bye.
 Chandler:Sure. Ummm. What’s up?
 Chandler:What gay thing?
 Chandler:Well okay Jerry thanks for stopping by.

 Chandler:You betcha!
 Chandler:Um-mm yeah right!
 Chandler:Oh yes and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
 Chandler:Okay but after that we’re shootin’ some pool.
 Chandler:Excuse I seem to have dropped my ball.

 Chandler:Do you have any beers? We’re out of beers.
 Chandler:You okay?
 Chandler:Right.
 Chandler:Noo!! You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t I don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
 Chandler:Oh-ho come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known in real life.
 Chandler:Umm this is nice.
 Chandler:No I mean it this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
 Chandler:Anyway I should go one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
 Chandler:Oh yeah that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh and listen it’s it’s gonna be....
 Chandler:Ross-Joey Joey-Ross. (they shake hands)
 Chandler:I can’t believe you came back.
 Chandler:If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible that would be the best.
 Chandler:(to Janice) Don’t look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
 Chandler:What a wank!
 Chandler:(leaning in) I’ll go.
 Chandler:See that’s why I could never be an actor. Because I can’t say gig.
 Chandler:Knock knock.
 Chandler:Hey I’m going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the bed) Whoa-whoa somebody missed the off ramp.
 Chandler:Okay. (to Monica) It’s a racecar.
 Chandler:Okay well it this bed isn’t new how come there is plastic on the mattress?
 Chandler:You told him to play the boxer gay!!
 Chandler:You totally screwed him over.
 Chandler:Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin’! (honks the bed’s little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops) All right I’ll leave. My bed’s so boring.
 Chandler:I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)
 Chandler:Okay I’m not gonna have one.
 Chandler:All right I’ll have one. (he and Ross take another brownie)
 Chandler:See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
 Chandler:That is so weird because every time I go to the dentist I look down the hygienist’s blouse.
 Chandler:Hey! Hold on a minute hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
 Chandler:Janice’s birthday is coming up I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
 Chandler:That’s a good idea ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday’. I would like to get her something serious.
 Chandler:All right. Look I’m gonna go in here and you don’t buy me anything ever. (starts to go into the store)
 Chandler:Why not?!
 Chandler:What is the thing?
 Chandler:(shocked) What?
 Chandler:Well she she wouldn’t do that she’s with she’s with me.
 Chandler:Yeah well you’re wrong! Okay you’re wrong.
 Chandler:Ah I don’t know you tell me. Anything you ah wanna tell me because if you ah you should if you you would tell me.
 Chandler:You tell me! Maybe it’s because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no no-no-no-no that was you!!
 Chandler:All right!
 Chandler:Joey told me he saw you two kissing.
 Chandler:No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
 Chandler:Wh-wh-why wh-why why why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
 Chandler:(giving her a bag) Here.
 Chandler:I’ll take it! All right look I gotta know. Are you finished with me? (Janice shakes her head no) Are you finished with him? (Janice shakes her head no) Do you still love him? (Janice shakes her head yes) Do you still love me? (Janice shakes her head yes) All right look (grabs the bag) I’m gonna need an actual answer here okay so which is it him or me? (his phone starts to ring)
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:All right.
 Chandler:I talked to Janice.
 Chandler:She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can’t even return them because she choked on the reciept!
 Chandler:I don’t know y'know. What what would you do?
 Chandler:Come on tell me.
 Chandler:What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you what are you talking about?
 Chandler:Janice I have something I need to tell you and I want you to let me get through it because it’s it’s it’s not gonna be easy.
 Chandler:I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guy that breaks up a family y'know when my parents split up it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason you are the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matter how nice he was or how happy he made my Dad.
 Chandler:Yeah well. It’s the right thing to do.
 Chandler:Then don’t leave me!
 Chandler:Forget what I said I was babbling! Pick me!
 Chandler:No you don’t! No no no I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
 Chandler:Ohhh. Don’t go.
 Chandler:No. No! No! No!
 Chandler:I don’t care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I don’t care!!
 Chandler:You can’t leave! I have your shoe!
 Chandler:(singing) I’ll hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe enters) I can’t resist your charms. And love....
 Chandler:(high pitched) No you know I don’t mind.
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:I’ve found.
 Chandler:No no no I don’t I don’t really wanna play.
 Chandler:That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that I don’t have goals!
 Chandler:Yeah all right I’ll play.
 Chandler:No no no you say that proudly.
 Chandler:And was the curse lifted?
 Chandler:But wait a minute though how are we gonna get there though because my Mom won’t let me cross the street.
 Chandler:And then Tineals.
 Chandler:Wow! Just like in the pros.
 Chandler:The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball but kicks Ross’s foot instead.)
 Chandler:Sorry. I’m sorry. Y'know what we’re just gonna throw it.
 Chandler:No no no actually losers rhyme.
 Chandler:(coming up under center just like a real quarterback does and puts his hands between Ross’s legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and looks at him) You wanna go shotgun?
 Chandler:(from the shotgun) Hike!
 Chandler:Great! Now the score is 7 to almost 7.
 Chandler:No no no no no!
 Chandler:(running up) Hey Joey do you wanna play football or you wanna.. (sees Marhan) Hi I’m Chandler.
 Chandler:Mar-haaaan.
 Chandler:Well that went well.
 Chandler:Y'know I was thinking about ah asking her for her number.
 Chandler:Whoa-ho whoa! No I was thinking about y'know for me as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
 Chandler:Thanks. What let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn’t I wouldn’t have a shot?
 Chandler:Math!! You’re giving me math! All right look y'know what forget about it you go for the girl we’ll see who gets her.
 Chandler:Well now you have two. Hey I am good at math.
 Chandler:Hey! Well I’ve been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that’s mean!
 Chandler:Before!!
 Chandler:Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
 Chandler:Okay good.
 Chandler:(to Margha) Hi.
 Chandler:No-no-no-no the game’s not over we’re just switching teams.
 Chandler:No ah hold on a second Joe where do Dutch people come from?
 Chandler:And the other ah Dutch people they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands right?
 Chandler:Fine with me.
 Chandler:Yes!!
 Chandler:Well you don’t you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
 Chandler:You hear that! That is her chose mister I’ll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)
 Chandler:Wh-what?
 Chandler:Y'know what it doesn’t matter ‘cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready Set Cook!
 Chandler:We’re not gonna lose to girls.
 Chandler:Okay okay so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
 Chandler:Hey-hey-hey Rachel funny thing. Actually the ah end zone starts at that pole so you’re five feet short so we win!

 Chandler:Yes. Yes there is they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
 Chandler:(reading the comics) Eh... I don’t I don’t know.
 Chandler:Well as old as he is in dog years do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
 Chandler:(thinks about it) Yeah?
 Chandler:Excuse me little one I have a very solid backhand.
 Chandler:I was shrieking... like a Marine.
 Chandler:(reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?
 Chandler:Look out kids he’s coming! (Ross continues to leave with his head down in shame.)
 Chandler:Yes. Yes and ah ah the trees are happy too because for most of them it’s the only chance to see New York.
 Chandler:Ahh do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
 Chandler:How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what two years ago?
 Chandler:He’s right if you quit this job you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
 Chandler:Because I’m too afraid.
 Chandler:Yeah that’d be much worse than being 28 and still working here.
 Chandler:(to Joey) Does this mean we’re gonna have to start paying for coffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)
 Chandler:I spelled out boobies.
 Chandler:So how many have you sold so far?
 Chandler:Oh my God how did you do that?
 Chandler:Me! On my computer.
 Chandler:Eh yeah well ah waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
 Chandler:Something else I might have said?
 Chandler:You-you-you don’t wanna give into the fear.
 Chandler:Run Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)
 Chandler:Tell us what happened Brown Bird Ross.
 Chandler:(to Rachel who’s entering) Hey! How’d the interview go?
 Chandler:Y'know what Rach maybe you should just y'know stay here at the coffee house.
 Chandler:Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself really perked up my Christmas.
 Chandler:It’s like ‘Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.’
 Chandler:Sure everybody loves a kidder.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Should I tell her I ordered tea?
 Chandler:I’m an alien. I’m an alien.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
 Chandler:I just saw Janice.
 Chandler:Yeah she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them.
 Chandler:Yes but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
 Chandler:Oh y'know what I’m gonna be okay you don’t have to throw a party for me.
 Chandler:Oh well then if anybody should have a party it should be him.
 Chandler:Okay well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know it’s supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
 Chandler:Hello-dillillio!!
 Chandler:(to Monica) Take off your shirt!
 Chandler:Yeah Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
 Chandler:(to Monica) Okay how many of that girl are you seeing?
 Chandler:Hi Joey’s sisters!
 Chandler:Oh I’m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
 Chandler:No-no-no-no no it’s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can’t we savor the precious moments? (to one of Joey’s sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.
 Chandler:Well my apartment isn’t there anymore because I drank it.
 Chandler:Yeah I ended up in the storage room and not alone.
 Chandler:Ow no ‘woo-hooing’ no ‘woo-hooing.’
 Chandler:Ah I fooled around with Joey’s sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well that’s not the worst part.
 Chandler:I can’t remember which sister.
 Chandler:Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?
 Chandler:(to Monica) You see you can’t tell which one is which either dwha!!
 Chandler:Veronica. Look it’s got to be Veronica the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
 Chandler:Look when I’ve been drinking sometimes I tend to get overly friendly and I’m sorry.
 Chandler:Why can’t we talk in here? With with witnesses.
 Chandler:It’s gotta be the first one.
 Chandler:Yep I’m in a tree.
 Chandler:Well that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I’ll be in Cuba.
 Chandler:What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
 Chandler:(shocked) Joey what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
 Chandler:I’m here to see Mary-Angela.
 Chandler:Where’s Mary-Angela?
 Chandler:This teramisu is is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
 Chandler:Well it’s it’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
 Chandler:So um Mary-Angela what’s your second favorite?
 Chandler:Would you just please....give me the receipt ‘cause this is great. It’s top notch.
 Chandler:So will I.
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn’t mean anything.
 Chandler:Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)
 Chandler:(startled) Hey!
 Chandler:Look I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him but he ducks it and moves away) Um I just got out of a relationship and I’m not really in a in a commitment kind of place.
 Chandler:Ahhhh you’re not Mary-Angela.
 Chandler:This is so bad. If-if you’re not Mary-Angela then-then who is?
 Chandler:Oh this is soo bad. (doesn’t see Mary-Angela)
 Chandler:No Joey! No Joey! Don’t Joey! Joey!
 Chandler:(pats him on the shoulder) You’re it! Now run and hide!
 Chandler:I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey’s sisters gasp) Look I’m sorry okay I was really drunk and you all look really similar.
 Chandler:Y'know what we should all calm down because your brother’s not going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?
 Chandler:Joey if you wanna punch me go ahead I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
 Chandler:Okay absolutely!
 Chandler:You’ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister’s but he still doesn’t know which one is Mary-Angela.)
 Chandler:What?! (Cookie punches him)
 Chandler:Don’t worry.
 Chandler:Oh yeah but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
 Chandler:All right I suppose I can wait a day. Hey what are you doing Friday?
 Chandler:I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert y'know he's the botanist.
 Chandler:Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
 Chandler:(to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Hey so can you make it on Friday?
 Chandler:Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
 Chandler:Well if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks then all right.
 Chandler:Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! (pause) Don't cry outloud.
 Chandler:I want to say you but that seems like such an easy answer.
 Chandler:I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
 Chandler:The abridgment.
 Chandler:....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
 Chandler:Oh no no no no.
 Chandler:All right I have to get that but no-no. (answering phone) Hello? (listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen I'm I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. (listens) Let me ask you this what what do you do for the extra hundred? (listens) So would I would I have to provide the grapes?
 Chandler:Okay we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
 Chandler:To yourself. (finishing) Hey-hey-hey y'know what that's pretty good.
 Chandler:Bye-bye.
 Chandler:What what what?!
 Chandler:You really think that is what he meant?
 Chandler:Look don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
 Chandler:Well why don't you send her a musical bug op no you already did that. All right look you're going to have to go there yourself now okay make a few surprise visits.
 Chandler:All right fine don't do anything just sit here and talk to us meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me because he understands me.'
 Chandler:He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
 Chandler:Oh yeah yeah! Look what I got look what I got. (holds up a pen) See she's fully dressed right?
 Chandler:And then you click it and uh-oh she's naked. And then and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman she's walking down the street she's window shopping and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa sh-she's naked! (Rachel just stares at him.)
 Chandler:Y'know what I'm I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
 Chandler:Oh okay Ross. Listen this pen is kinda getting boring so can you pick me up some porn?
 Chandler:Man I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing)
 Chandler:Yeah. Either that or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
 Chandler:Yeah baby!
 Chandler:Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
 Chandler:Well she spent the last six months getting over him and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.
 Chandler:Oh hey.
 Chandler:(to Robert) So ah isn’t a bit cold out for shorts?
 Chandler:Right right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
 Chandler:(standing up) I’m up! I’m up I’ve gotten up now! Anybody ah want anything?
 Chandler:Okay Ross why don’t you come with me?
 Chandler:Robert’s coming out.
 Chandler:No. He.....he’s coming out of his shorts.
 Chandler:The man is showing brain.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Wellll?
 Chandler:What do we do? What do we do?
 Chandler:Like an eclipse.
 Chandler:Your liking it huh?
 Chandler:No actually Laurie’s a boy.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:You mean a three pointer?
 Chandler:I’m sorry I’m sorry it just seems that Robert isn’t as concealed in the shorts area as ah one may have hoped.
 Chandler:Stretchy pants! Why those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day every day!
 Chandler:Hmmm that’s very cool.
 Chandler:I can’t believe she cracked your code!
 Chandler:No Beth doesn’t die she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?
 Chandler:We can’t tell him you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
 Chandler:Yeah we got um-hmm.
 Chandler:I like her.
 Chandler:Well that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from these people.
 Chandler:(to Ross) All right listen I have to go to the bathroom but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I’d like know whether that’s several big fish or just one big fish.
 Chandler:No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called ‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’
 Chandler:Jeez man did you fall..(sees it’s a beautiful woman coming out of the men’s room) Hi! So ah did ya did-did-did ya fall high?
 Chandler:(to Gunther) Y'know what Gunther go ah go ahead I’m-I’m talking to ah (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) This is the part where you say your name.
 Chandler:Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger so....
 Chandler:Nope nope I’d just ah I’d rather talk to you. (pause) Yes I do. Yes I do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)
 Chandler:Well that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve ever met in a men’s room.
 Chandler:(sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op foot in a puddle foot all in a puddle.
 Chandler:Yeah we’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
 Chandler:No really you’re gonna freeze.
 Chandler:You’re not what do you what do you got a bionic foot?
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half stole my car.
 Chandler:Great. It was great. She’s ah she’s great great looking great personality she’s greatness.
 Chandler:Joey told you about the leg huh?
 Chandler:Oh God it freaked me out. Okay I know it shouldn’t have but it did. I mean I like her I don’t want to stop seeing her but every so often it’s like ‘Hey y'know what where’s your leg?’ I mean I’m the smallest person in the world aren’t I? I’m the smallest person in the world.
 Chandler:(to Monica) Actually he’s the smallest person in the world.
 Chandler:It came up.
 Chandler:No. No. Actually I forgot what is the deal with that again?
 Chandler:No. No. I don’t think so.
 Chandler:That’s-that’s my nubbin.
 Chandler:It’s kinda a ah a third nipple kinda thing.
 Chandler:Well y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... (starts to kiss her again but she gets up.) Ahh what?
 Chandler:You ah you have you have to leave now? How come?
 Chandler:(entering happily) Well hello!
 Chandler:The doctor.
 Chandler:Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples no waiting.
 Chandler:That was an obvious joke and I didn’t think of it. Why didn’t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God what have I done!
 Chandler:(entering) Hey does anybody need anything copied? I’m going down to the Xerox place.
 Chandler:Okay listen just give me anything I can make two of.
 Chandler:Yeah! You wanna come?
 Chandler:Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
 Chandler:Uh-oh.
 Chandler:(to Joey) Okay that hurt us.
 Chandler:Well ah ........y'know.
 Chandler:All right rock on. (Does the ‘Hang 10’ sign then hides his face in shame.)
 Chandler:Hey y'know what maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
 Chandler:What time is it now?
 Chandler:Yeah all right so we’ll hang out.
 Chandler:Yes. Vividly.
 Chandler:Yeah I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah I-I think so...
 Chandler:Yeah. Yeah I mean what what would we do?
 Chandler:She was kidding.
 Chandler:She was.... But y'know what just in case maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
 Chandler:Yeah. Good call nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed and and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab something with his hand.)
 Chandler:Right. Right. Well ah y'know we could flip for it.
 Chandler:Well it you don’t know that then I don’t want to do this with you.
 Chandler:And that’s the only colour that comes in.
 Chandler:So what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
 Chandler:Hey no way! Come on this is you guys call her and work it out.
 Chandler:Hey this isn’t like swimming after you eat pick up the phone!!
 Chandler:Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
 Chandler:Why? What happened to him?
 Chandler:Oh my God! Oh my God!
 Chandler:Well before we answer that I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
 Chandler:He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit and you’re just gonna hurt her.
 Chandler:All right look if you absolutely have to tell her at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.
 Chandler:Okay okay-okay ah Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail I did it!
 Chandler:Off?!!
 Chandler:Yeah well I don’t think you can make that statement unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
 Chandler:Oh that’s mature.
 Chandler:Nothing nothing.
 Chandler:Yeah well I guess they had a fight and he got drunk....
 Chandler:(to Joey) He has sex and we get hit in our heads.
 Chandler:Uh-oh.
 Chandler:She was not good. Not good.
 Chandler:Uh-oh.
 Chandler:Yeah never cheat on Rachel.
 Chandler:Y'know what I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
 Chandler:(handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut we’re never leaving ever.
 Chandler:Oh great food with hair on it.
 Chandler:Because that would be crazy?
 Chandler:Yeah come on it’s Ross and Rachel they’ve got too.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Are you actually saying these words?
 Chandler:Let’s go.
 Chandler:(to Joey) Is that your new walk?
 Chandler:This is the New York Times.
 Chandler:We are. He’s meeting us here.
 Chandler:Yeah y-you how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
 Chandler:Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
 Chandler:Y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay I mean it’s been a week.
 Chandler:No.
 Chandler:Yes yes it’s just that we ah we kinda all ready made plans with Ross.
 Chandler:Yeah he’s really excited about it too he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
 Chandler:(jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!
 Chandler:Well actually yesterday I was smoking again. Today I’m I’m smoking still.
 Chandler:Look I’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce which is when I started smoking in the first place.
 Chandler:Yeahhh. I’m tellin’ ya something that ah first smoke after nap time....
 Chandler:Oh that’s great with my luck that’s gonna be him.
 Chandler:Nope hymn 253 His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and it’s Rachel again.)
 Chandler:Hey shut up!! You’re not my real Mom!!
 Chandler:Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
 Chandler:Well then I might as well offer to stay.
 Chandler:(to Joey) Well he’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Beam me up Jesus.
 Chandler:Okay well then I-I have to go to the bathroom.
 Chandler:Oh come on there’s a rest stop right up there! Come on I really have to goooooooooo.
 Chandler:Here we go. Okay brace yourselves.
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no-no-no-no!!
 Chandler:(to Joey) My lighter’s in there! (points to the cab)
 Chandler:Damn! (stands up) The tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this!
 Chandler:Oh I do! Op no wait a minute I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
 Chandler:Ladies ladies let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe Rachel take off Monica’s bra.
 Chandler:Well I thought if I littered that crying Indian might come by and save us.
 Chandler:Okay now let’s decide who has the nicest ass.
 Chandler:At least let me smoke it to the good part.
 Chandler:I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another cigarette.)
 Chandler:Well it’s very unsettling.
 Chandler:Oh no now it’s not gonna make any sense!
 Chandler:Oh this is horrible it’s just horrible.
 Chandler:It’s horrible.
 Chandler:Y'know what I can handle it handle’s my middle name. Actually it’s the ah middle part of my first name.
 Chandler:Guys guys guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to stop the fighting.)
 Chandler:I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
 Chandler:Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:No-no why don’t you hang on to that one.
 Chandler:Okay that’s like the least fun game ever.
 Chandler:Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking patch and it falls off.) Nope that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake laughs.)
 Chandler:Or what my Father called Thursday night.
 Chandler:Y'know I would’ve bet good money that he’d be the first one of us to get married.
 Chandler:Always illegal Joe.
 Chandler:If that doesn’t keep kids in school what will?
 Chandler:(entering carrying a briefcase) Hi.
 Chandler:Y'know I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
 Chandler:Y'know what pretty good.
 Chandler:Good! I haven’t smoked yet today I feel great and-and-and confident that is a stunning blouse.
 Chandler:Thanks
 Chandler:What check thing?
 Chandler:(reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete… (quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?
 Chandler:Who’s he huggin’?
 Chandler:This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
 Chandler:There you go!!
 Chandler:(to the girls who are staring at him) What?
 Chandler:(in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)
 Chandler:Okay okay just because he buys you dinner does not mean you owe him anything.
 Chandler:Okay then get the lobster!
 Chandler:Mr. Millionaire new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
 Chandler:Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
 Chandler:Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
 Chandler:Yeah either that or Gloria Estefan was right eventually the rhythm is going to get you.
 Chandler:It’s possible. You are very loveable I’d miss you if I broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.
 Chandler:(in a deep voice) If I broke up with you I’d miss you.
 Chandler:And you’re our age. You’re our age.
 Chandler:That’s not a state Joe.
 Chandler:You’re our age!
 Chandler:I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter I still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?
 Chandler:Is there any chance you didn’t see that?
 Chandler:Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!
 Chandler:You didn’t just break up.
 Chandler:You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
 Chandler:Stop what?!
 Chandler:No!! You can’t!!
 Chandler:I am your friend and I am not gonna let you do this!! (Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly strong!
 Chandler:Look man!
 Chandler:Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.)
 Chandler:She’s moving on! Okay if it’s not this guy it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay man? It’s over.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:I know. (He rubs Ross’s head)
 Chandler:I don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. (He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest like a gunfighter in a Western.)
 Chandler:(to Joey) I wasn’t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing his stuff down.) Uh-oh what did she do now?
 Chandler:Ah Sliced Bread a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
 Chandler:I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
 Chandler:I’m talking about you. You big big freak.
 Chandler:Hey you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
 Chandler:‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name.
 Chandler:No it’s not like like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider man. Y'know like ah like Goldman is a last name but there’s no Gold Man.
 Chandler:So ahh what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
 Chandler:What about things that are already gold?
 Chandler:Okay let’s play my game now.
 Chandler:Wait a minute wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!
 Chandler:My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh that’s-that’s okay no problem. (He starts to look around her office.)
 Chandler:Yes I realise that.
 Chandler:That’s the stuff! (quickly grabs it)
 Chandler:Thanks it’s ah Gaelic for ‘Thy turkey’s done.’ So ah I’m gonna go nice nice meeting you.
 Chandler:Hello.
 Chandler:(holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?
 Chandler:Oh I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
 Chandler:Oh-ho liked what she saw huh? Dug my action did she? Checkin’ out the Chan-Chan man!
 Chandler:Yeah she seemed cool attractive. I’ll do it.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey my Father’s house does that!
 Chandler:Well the movie was great dinner was great and there’s nothing like a cool crisp New York evening.
 Chandler:Of course I didn’t get to enjoy any of that because Joanna’s such a big dull dud!
 Chandler:(entering with Rachel) I’m telling ya Joanna’s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime. I’ll give you a call.’
 Chandler:That’s what you say at the end of a date.
 Chandler:To her face? Look it’s the end of the date I’m standing there I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know comes out. I can’t help it it’s a compulsion.
 Chandler:Multiple so many paper cuts.
 Chandler:(sarcastic) Oh well give me the phone then.
 Chandler:Look you can’t call somebody after this long just to say ‘In case you didn’t notice I don’t like you!’
 Chandler:Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
 Chandler:All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
 Chandler:That’s just a lot of big talk y'know.
 Chandler:It’s not a big deal. It’s just it’s right here (points to his eye) and it’s all the time.
 Chandler:(He looks over at Rachel who nods her head) Yes this this was pleasant.
 Chandler:The food there was was great.
 Chandler:So take care.
 Chandler:Well this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime. (Rachel is disappointed)
 Chandler:Noo!
 Chandler:Look I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak and pathetic and sorry.
 Chandler:Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you.
 Chandler:I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I was going to when I’m not. Look this has nothing to do with you y'know? And this isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment intimacy (pause) mascara goop. And I’m really sorry it’s just that this is not this isn’t going to work out.
 Chandler:Yeah o-okay.
 Chandler:Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
 Chandler:(sporting a goatee) Hey.
 Chandler:Oh so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me. (there’s no reaction from Joey) Okay listen you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:No way!
 Chandler:Oh my God! Who’s gonna watch that?!
 Chandler:Yeah. (they start to leave)
 Chandler:Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)
 Chandler:So um after you put the suggestion in the box how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
 Chandler:Okay so I guess that’s about ah two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Okay. (He opens it and it’s a baby chick) It’s a chicken.
 Chandler:Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
 Chandler:Easy Lenny.
 Chandler:Okay but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here and a chick-chick there. Here a chick there a chick everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey enters)-chickeeeen.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:She?
 Chandler:I don’t know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over trying to determine the sex of the chick and blows on it.) I can’t tell what ever it was went back in too quickly.
 Chandler:Excuse me?
 Chandler:I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
 Chandler:You don’t think I get up when you get up?
 Chandler:Yes here it comes! I’m stuck here all day and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don’t think so mister!
 Chandler:And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?
 Chandler:I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got this chick we’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?
 Chandler:I’ll take her back tomorrow.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:(rushing in) Oh good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
 Chandler:I know. See yes. That’s Yasmine Bleeth she’s a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter and you know what I found out?
 Chandler:If they can’t find a home for her they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
 Chandler:Okay. And it’s not just chicks y'know? It’s all kinds of other animals!
 Chandler:Thanks I’m glad you see it that way.
 Chandler:Ohhh-hoo funny story!
 Chandler:Okay! Now you stay out here and you think about what you did!!
 Chandler:That’s a bad duck!!! (to Ross) How’d the thing go tonight Ross?
 Chandler:(to the duck) Okay now when you come back I hope you remember that that chick is not a toy! (He goes back into the apartment)
 Chandler:(coming out of his apartment and seeing Ross) What did you do?
 Chandler:Having a swim.
 Chandler:Chicks don’t swim.
 Chandler:I don’t know. Should we try it?
 Chandler:See I told you they don’t swim. (He goes to take it out)
 Chandler:Noo! (takes him out) Oh it’s okay it’s okay baby baby baby.
 Chandler:Ye-e-es!!
 Chandler:Who’s number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
 Chandler:Bye!
 Chandler:Yeah and I don’t have any cologne.
 Chandler:Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
 Chandler:(entering carrying the chick and duck) Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
 Chandler:Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
 Chandler:(seeing Joey) There he is!
 Chandler:Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:So that’s the girl you like.
 Chandler:Wait a minute wait a minute you don’t like the guy Rachel’s dating? Well that’s odd.
 Chandler:Could I borrow it?
 Chandler:Oh-ho-ho-ho.
 Chandler:715. (Monica looks at him) Watch doesn’t work.
 Chandler:Yeah and at the end of the play he he got up y'know and he just started like (claps his hands) banging his hands together!
 Chandler:Ross don’t. Ross!
 Chandler:Ohh that’s a good one.
 Chandler:Why don’t you use ours across the hall ‘cause she…has…problems.
 Chandler:Step away from the duck.
 Chandler:And yet she’s still not hanging up the phone.
 Chandler:Ye-e-es!!
 Chandler:Who’s number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
 Chandler:Bye!
 Chandler:Yeah and I don’t have any cologne.
 Chandler:Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
 Chandler:(entering carrying the chick and duck) Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
 Chandler:Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.

 Chandler:Ohh that’s a good one.
 Chandler:Why don’t you use ours across the hall ‘cause she…has…problems.
 Chandler:Step away from the duck.
 Chandler:And yet she’s still not hanging up the phone.
 Chandler:Do you think that there’s a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah as you’re driving into town there’s-there’s like a sign and it says “You’re in Sample.” (He says it like urine sample.)
 Chandler:Yeah it’s two guys in a ring and the rules are “They’re are no rules.”
 Chandler:Yes but there’s two in martini soo everybody back to my office.
 Chandler:Oh it’s Bing sir. I’m sorry  I was just ah...
 Chandler:All right buddy way to go! (smacks him on the butt)
 Chandler:Thank you! Today my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
 Chandler:Well I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
 Chandler:Yeah I know for a really great stew you just y'know stick your head in between ‘em.
 Chandler:(to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?
 Chandler:(to his co-workers) What is with him?
 Chandler:Well that’s not true he-he smacked you once.
 Chandler:No sir.
 Chandler:(joining them) Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger?
 Chandler:Nine times! Okay I had to put on lotion! But it’s gonna be okay because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment and if all goes as planned my butt will be smack free.
 Chandler:Excuse me Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!
 Chandler:No I ah I didn’t do them.
 Chandler:No no I just ah didn’t do them. Instead I ah hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise verbal or otherwise.
 Chandler:Doug!!
 Chandler:I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
 Chandler:No no. It-it’s not about the swearing it’s more about ah the way that you ah occasionally concentrate your enthusiasm on my buttock.
 Chandler:Oh and don’t get me wrong I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I I have a rather sensitive posterior and ah besides it’s making all the other guys jealous.
 Chandler:Okay. (he starts to leave)
 Chandler:Ahhhhh! (walks out imitating shooting himself in the head)
 Chandler:Thank you sir.
 Chandler:No. No not at all that’s-that’s ridiculous.
 Chandler:Ye-ye-yeah yes I do!
 Chandler:Run! Run you crazy rich freak!
 Chandler:(to Bonnie) So ah your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
 Chandler:Tell it again. (pause we see Rachel is not amused.) Seriously.

 Chandler:You’re not gonna die an old maid maybe an old spinster cook.
 Chandler:Hey now besides if worst comes to worst I’ll be your boyfriend.
 Chandler:Why is that so funny?
 Chandler:Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah boyfriend material?
 Chandler:Okay so we’ve established my name and hit me. But theoretically y'know I mean say we weren’t friends say it’s a blind date. I show up at your door and I’m like (in a fake voice) “Hey nice to meet ya. Hey oh-hey.”
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:What a minute I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can’t have children!!
 Chandler:Buy it for ya or win it for ya?
 Chandler:Big bullies!!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Bored and bored!
 Chandler:Yes!
 Chandler:Okay umm we all have to play strip poker.
 Chandler:So you still don’t think I’m boyfriend material?
 Chandler:I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
 Chandler:Yeah well lucky for you.
 Chandler:I don’t know.
 Chandler:Oh yeah I don’t know what they were doing but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
 Chandler:Where ya going?
 Chandler:(to Joey) Noo!! I don’t care! I’m not I’m not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
 Chandler:Okay then you gotta back away all right? You don’t need that kind’ve hurt. Take it from a guy who’s never had a long term relationship......

 Chandler:Okay! Okay! Let me try it again you’re gonna wanna date this next guy I swear!
 Chandler:Hi! I’m Dorf! You’re date for the evening. (Monica walks away in disgust) Oh come on! Dorf on dating that’s good stuff!!
 Chandler:(to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away in disgust)
 Chandler:(jumping up) Oh I’ll go out and get you some.
 Chandler:Nope! Because I’m not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe who’s entering) Hey Pheebs how did it go?
 Chandler:I found a dried up seashores.
 Chandler:All right there’s a nuclear holocaust I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
 Chandler:I’ve got canned goods.
 Chandler:Excellent hole Joe.
 Chandler:Well can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
 Chandler:We’ve got to do something!
 Chandler:Y'know what he’s right. There’s something like uh ammonia in that that like kills the pain.
 Chandler:Me too!!
 Chandler:Oh my God! If you say that one more time I’m gonna break up with you!
 Chandler:Look Ross you have what you want you’re back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
 Chandler:(jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
 Chandler:I’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
 Chandler:(running over and joining Monica) They’ll never understand!
 Chandler:(following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn’t think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monica’s shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)
 Chandler:And then Joey remembered something.
 Chandler:(wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me “Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!” Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
 Chandler:(entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?
 Chandler:I KNEW IT!!!!
 Chandler:We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple we could play this game naked.
 Chandler:Okay. All right.
 Chandler:Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
 Chandler:You don’t turn and slide you throw it out! I’m tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
 Chandler:All right how about we how ‘bout we sell it.
 Chandler:(nods his head) Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to Joey) They seem all right with it!
 Chandler:Uh-huh first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
 Chandler:(reading the ad) Stunning entertainment center. Fine (pause) fine Italian craftsmanship. (Joey is very proud of himself)
 Chandler:You want it?
 Chandler:Ahh Gepeto $5000 dollars? Are you insane?
 Chandler:All right look I’m changing it to 50 bucks or your best offer.
 Chandler:(looks at him) Nooo.
 Chandler:I can’t believe you don’t know what I do for a living!
 Chandler:(interrupting) Let it go!!
 Chandler:Yes Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
 Chandler:You’ll have to pardon my roommate he wanted to marry this.
 Chandler:Y'know I I really don’t think we need a canoe.
 Chandler:All right just just take the entertainment center and then when you get home throw the canoe away!
 Chandler:Y'know what I think this might be one of the times he’s wrong.
 Chandler:Oh-no he’s right.
 Chandler:I’m coming already!!
 Chandler:OH MY GOD!!!
 Chandler:Are you all right?!
 Chandler:(lets him out) What happened?!!
 Chandler:What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
 Chandler:So—You got in voluntarily?!
 Chandler:BEND OVER?!!!
 Chandler:Oh umm Joey was born and then 28 years later I was robbed!!
 Chandler:Oh they said uh “You don’t have insurance here so stop calling us.”
 Chandler:Pheebs if she could come back as a couch we’d really appreciate it. (Joey nods in agreement)
 Chandler:Yeah it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn’t say ‘cool’ anymore.
 Chandler:Oh yeah gym member. I try to go four times a week but I’ve missed the last 1200 times.
 Chandler:You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
 Chandler:Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:Oh no you’ll have to come.
 Chandler:Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?
 Chandler:Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on the table!
 Chandler:Yes. (In a stronger voice) Yes!
 Chandler:No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
 Chandler:Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.
 Chandler:I wanna quit the gym.
 Chandler:(He turns to Ross and Ross makes a ‘Be strong’ sound.) I wanna quit the gym.
 Chandler:(horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about himself) I wanna quit the gym.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:No I almost did couldn’t leave Ross there without a spotter!
 Chandler:We’re doomed. Okay they’re gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
 Chandler:You’re a genius!
 Chandler:Now there’s two reasons.
 Chandler:Thank you Joey.

 Chandler:(sees Kathy is up watching TV) Hi!

 Chandler:Oh! It's on! It's on!
 Chandler:There we go little fella.
 Chandler:Well the duck can swim.
 Chandler:Oh yeah me too she's so cool and pretty.
 Chandler:She's smart and funny y'know? We were up all last night talking she said the funniest thing about--what?
 Chandler:No I don't.
 Chandler:Thank you Ross.
 Chandler:All right.
 Chandler:All right.
 Chandler:Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keeps running Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to The Mod Squad starts to play. First a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a hot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs in desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees himself and resumes the chase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of garbage he tries to get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. He gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of cabs.) Kathy! (He jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) Kathy.
 Chandler:Oh I just wanted to say Hey!
 Chandler:Okay. (He walks away disgusted with himself.)
 Chandler:(entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
 Chandler:I don't know. I can't--I just I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean I'm a very bad person. I'm a very very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he waits for a reaction when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
 Chandler:Really?!
 Chandler:(laughs) Right in there!
 Chandler:99...100! Ready or not here I come! (He opens his eyes and sees that the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All right let's go over the concept one more time.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Ohh umm y'know what I already ate.
 Chandler:Y'know I had a big meal on Monday y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
 Chandler:You-you do?
 Chandler:You got me.
 Chandler:Yeah. Right.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Ohh she's-she's not really my type.
 Chandler:Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
 Chandler:Uhh no-no thanks.
 Chandler:Listen I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Hey look what do you want from me?
 Chandler:I am pretending.
 Chandler:Okay what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? (Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically over-the-top wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
 Chandler:Can I sleep on your couch?
 Chandler:Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
 Chandler:Where did you when did you how did you... (Joey hits the back of Chandler's head) How did you get a girl like that?
 Chandler:Okay but that's like the easiest era.
 Chandler:Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
 Chandler:Phebes it was your birthday like months ago.
 Chandler:Well I have a call in about that.
 Chandler:Actually this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
 Chandler:Okay but don't touch it because you fingers have destructive oils.
 Chandler:Oh it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
 Chandler:It doesn't say that. Does it?
 Chandler:Okay all right I'll just uh make sure that uh Joey gets her something really great.
 Chandler:It's okay the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into the bathroom.) Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
 Chandler:(confused) Sure...
 Chandler:I don't know... um Grease?
 Chandler:Rent?
 Chandler:Okay so when do you want to go?
 Chandler:Yes it is at Office Max.
 Chandler:A pen.
 Chandler:Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
 Chandler:Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
 Chandler:All right look look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
 Chandler:For three years?
 Chandler:All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her okay?
 Chandler:Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
 Chandler:Okay all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
 Chandler:Oh yeah. Yeah I found this great place called Invisible things for Kathy. (Motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
 Chandler:She's really going to love this you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
 Chandler:Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
 Chandler:Where?
 Chandler:I got something for her. (Joey picks up the package shakes it next to his ear can't hear anything switches ears shakes it again.) It's a book!
 Chandler:No it's a book that's just a book okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So uh just... let me know if she likes it okay?
 Chandler:No it came out to an even twenty.
 Chandler:Hey how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
 Chandler:Oh yeah? That's great!
 Chandler:[nodding with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh....
 Chandler:Hey! Happy birthday.
 Chandler:No he didn't. [Moving it back.]
 Chandler:Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
 Chandler:See you think it's just a pen but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
 Chandler:Oh yeah... yeah.
 Chandler:[to Kathy] Goodnight.
 Chandler:Oh uh yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing you... you don't always know the exact time.
 Chandler:Uh the book?
 Chandler:What do you mean?
 Chandler:(tongue-tied) Uhl..ell. By the way in case you missed that that sound was Uhl ell.
 Chandler:Oh yeah he's my... he's my best friend.
 Chandler:Goodnight. (Goes to his room.)
 Chandler:(entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
 Chandler:It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way I think she knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles she’s smooth! Smooth! (leaves)
 Chandler:(rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
 Chandler:Goin’ out huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So things didn’t work out with Kathy huh? Bummer.
 Chandler:(shocked) What?
 Chandler:Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!
 Chandler:Well I’m upset—for you. I mean having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can’t believe he just sad that.)
 Chandler:Look Joey Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey I mean granted I only saw the back of her head but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart and funny and gets you.
 Chandler:All right look I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice pick a lane.
 Chandler:All right! Bring it on you…
 Chandler:(interrupting) Oh my God! Play!
 Chandler:Really bitchin’!
 Chandler:You mean like music?
 Chandler:Yeah I know what you’re thinkin’! Yes yes your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
 Chandler:Come in!
 Chandler:Uh yes but uh I just watch it for the articles.
 Chandler:No-no he’s not back yet but he’ll be here any minute. So uh come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
 Chandler:I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) …of the boat. (The phone rings and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.
 Chandler:What happened?
 Chandler:Why can’t you tell her?
 Chandler:Joey! Joey!!
 Chandler:I thought your time ran out.
 Chandler:(to Kathy) Uhh that was Joey. He’s running a little late he says he’s sorry.
 Chandler:So I guess it’s just uh you and me then.
 Chandler:Yeah I think it is!
 Chandler:Oh I had an appointment to get my haircut…
 Chandler:…and then it got canceled.
 Chandler:Really?! You do that?
 Chandler:Dog grooming huh? Okay just don’t make my tail too poofy.
 Chandler:Well thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through his hair and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Y’know who also has great hair is Joey!
 Chandler:What-what ‘cha doin’?
 Chandler:‘Kay.
 Chandler:(jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phone’s making sounds! (On phone) Hello!
 Chandler:Hey it’s Joey!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)
 Chandler:Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
 Chandler:Oh.
 Chandler:No-no-no-no this is bad! It’s bad! This is bad!
 Chandler:Wait the uh the kiss or the situation?
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here’s what we do we-we forget it happened.
 Chandler:Okay we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we’re unhappy forever. Sound good?
 Chandler:I have to; he’s my best friend and you’re seeing him.
 Chandler:(interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Don’t! Don’t! See-see you’re getting me confused I’m starting to urn.
 Chandler:I-I think we have too.
 Chandler:Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against the door.) Are you still out there?
 Chandler:Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to reveal a fully furnished apartment.)
 Chandler:I sure did.
 Chandler:Well I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the TV.)
 Chandler:Well y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
 Chandler:Oh I don’t know.
 Chandler:You mean with Casey.
 Chandler:Or Casey.
 Chandler:Could be Casey.
 Chandler:Consider Casey.
 Chandler:That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
 Chandler:I kissed Kathy.
 Chandler:No. Is there anyway anyway you think he’ll understand this?
 Chandler:Oh don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Is it?
 Chandler:Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!
 Chandler:God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!
 Chandler:Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
 Chandler:Yeah I know.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Is that a real thing?
 Chandler:Listen ah Joe I-I need to I need to talk to you about something.
 Chandler:It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm uh I like her. I like her a lot actually.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Oh uh when?
 Chandler:Oh man I am so sorry. Are are you okay?
 Chandler:Yes but I-I uh don’t have too.
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:Well I thought that would be the best thing to do.
 Chandler:See uh that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
 Chandler:It’s me. I’m the other guy.
 Chandler:Yeah I mean when you were late last night Kathy and I got to talking and one thing to another and…
 Chandler:No! No! No! I just kissed her.
 Chandler:How is that worse?!
 Chandler:Look I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do I think I’m in love with her!
 Chandler:You’re right I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
 Chandler:Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
 Chandler:Probably because…
 Chandler:(on phone) Hey it’s me. I know you can’t stand to be in the same room as me so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone. All I… (Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)
 Chandler:Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend but I’m… (Joey hangs up the phone again.)
 Chandler:(entering) Aww turkey! Aww giving thanks! Aww!
 Chandler:They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night just trying to get him to talk to me.
 Chandler:Hey by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa ‘cause I wanna trade for her.
 Chandler:Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
 Chandler:Oh that’s not true! That’s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it… (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe’s faces.) Oh there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase and I had R.G. put on it… (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials…
 Chandler:Op y'know what though it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase.
 Chandler:Hey what time is it? The big game is about to start!
 Chandler:Thanks.
 Chandler:Monica got ice in her eye and it hurts.
 Chandler:Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
 Chandler:He’s really picky about his patients.
 Chandler:(entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah he gave me the finger while doing it.
 Chandler:Oh y’know what I was already trying to trade for ah well you.
 Chandler:I don’t know R.G. I was thinking something girlie for your office.
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no you don’t want to do that then you’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
 Chandler:Like?
 Chandler:When was the last time you saw her wear it?
 Chandler:Big dog?
 Chandler:I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
 Chandler:Hey Joe.
 Chandler:Hey! I’m sorry! That—(sees that Joey is about to leave) where are you going?
 Chandler:Oh uh when-when are you coming back?
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:Hey look what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her?
 Chandler:Hey look I know what it is to be a friend I just-I just screwed up!
 Chandler:All right look if you’re not gonna stay for me then at least stay for them! Okay they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:All right wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?
 Chandler:(He is now in the box in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
 Chandler:The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through the air hole) it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another finger) it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a third finger) it hurts!
 Chandler:Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)
 Chandler:How do ya do.
 Chandler:What happened? What happened?!
 Chandler:Gotcha! (laughs)
 Chandler:Sorry!
 Chandler:Okay okay you got it!
 Chandler:You can’t tell but I’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
 Chandler:You’re right and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear I won’t say another word tonight.
 Chandler:Absolutely!
 Chandler:So?
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:Man this is…
 Chandler:Oh yeah! How did you meet her?
 Chandler:Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
 Chandler:How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie? (laughs at they all look at him) That joke would’ve killed in Albany.
 Chandler:Hey look at this! (Holding a newspaper) They’re lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
 Chandler:All right who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this I can’t believe I missed it.
 Chandler:Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.
 Chandler:Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office do you want me to set you up?
 Chandler:Well I have a girlfriend I’m-I’m happy. So I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
 Chandler:Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
 Chandler:Hey you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director I think it was Orson Wells who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know who’s boss.
 Chandler:(he glares at him for a while) Yes.
 Chandler:I say Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him) Og-ee-op I’m not asking for me I’m… I mean… No I’m-I’m not gay I’m not asking you out. I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!
 Chandler:See my friend-my friend Rachel she wants to be set up.
 Chandler:Oh y’know what that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling that might be all right with Rachel.
 Chandler:(to Drew) Oh by the way that is her full name.
 Chandler:Oh well that’s uh a little later than I uh generally care to stay but sure!
 Chandler:Well I don’t really know what that is but let’s!!
 Chandler:(entering) Hello children!
 Chandler:(to Rachel) Have I got the 50 guys for you!
 Chandler:Oh yeah I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They’re buying me drinks! They’re giving me stuff! (to Joey) Knicks tonight?
 Chandler:Wherever! I’ve got like 20!
 Chandler:Y’know what I’m gonna uh play the field just a little more.
 Chandler:Guys are signing over their 401-K’s to me?
 Chandler:(pause) Yes. (to Rachel) Okay there’s this one guy Patrick I think you’re gonna like him he’s really nice he’s funny he’s a swimmer.
 Chandler:Yes and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
 Chandler:See I’m not bad at this fixing up thing huh?
 Chandler:Oh he works in the Fine Foods division.
 Chandler:It’s a big company I don’t—if you—I…
 Chandler:Oh yeah! With who?
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Hey man!
 Chandler:Well like father like son.
 Chandler:Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
 Chandler:Ummmmmmmm no.
 Chandler:Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see.
 Chandler:(interrupting) Oh y’know y’know what Pheebs?
 Chandler:I’m not Jewish so…
 Chandler:Bad dream?
 Chandler:Oh yeah then uh what was Phoebe’s song about?
 Chandler:Prague?
 Chandler:I did! I absolutely did!
 Chandler:I’m sure you’re right but why?
 Chandler:Oh man. I’m sorry I’m so-so sorry.
 Chandler:I know! I know!
 Chandler:Well y’know you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody! You’re a great catch! Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you I didn’t have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)
 Chandler:Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude right?
 Chandler:Oh it doesn’t matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey y’know what I’ve got two tickets to tonight’s Rangers game you wanna come with me?
 Chandler:Well actually it’s a hockey team so it’s angry Canadians with no teeth.
 Chandler:Have you ever been with a woman?
 Chandler:So there is no good time to ask that question.
 Chandler:Oh yeah! How did you meet her?
 Chandler:Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
 Chandler:How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie? (laughs at they all look at him) That joke would’ve killed in Albany.

 Chandler:Have you ever been with a woman?
 Chandler:So there is no good time to ask that question.
 Chandler:I don’t know but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
 Chandler:Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
 Chandler:Well you-you know what I meant.
 Chandler:So what job did you get Joe?
 Chandler:You’re gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
 Chandler:Oh yeah sure it’s not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
 Chandler:Yes. Right where?
 Chandler:Yeah you-you gotta love the talking.
 Chandler:All right we haven’t had sex yet. Okay what’s the big deal? Y’know? This is special and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
 Chandler:No he’s right I’m totally lying.
 Chandler:Well Kathy’s last boyfriend was Joey.
 Chandler:No I’m afraid I won’t be able to make love as well as him.
 Chandler:Yes and I was saying the actual words.
 Chandler:We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:All right all right I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I’m just doing it for you guys.
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
 Chandler:Yes yes we had the sex.
 Chandler:It was fine y’know? But she didn’t agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like I see you point I’m all right with it.
 Chandler:Look you have to help me! Okay? I mean I know what to do with a woman y’know I know where everything goes it’s always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to My God! Somebody’s killing her in there!
 Chandler:Look you don’t have to draw an actual wo—whoa! She’s hot!
 Chandler:(shocked) There are seven?!
 Chandler:(Points to one) That’s one?
 Chandler:Oh y’know-y’know what I was looking at it upside down.
 Chandler:That-that’s bad?
 Chandler:Well you might if it were anything like 7!
 Chandler:You!
 Chandler:Well the vet seems to think that’s she’s becoming a rooster. (The rooster crows.) We’re getting a second opinion.
 Chandler:Oh I can uh check that for ya.
 Chandler:I can check that for ya.
 Chandler:Well… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
 Chandler:(to Rachel) And you… Ross I believe if you check Rachel’s bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
 Chandler:Okay ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Stop that now!
 Chandler:Yes!
 Chandler:Diet soda.
 Chandler:Orange juice.
 Chandler:Oh-oh oh oh-oh! (Whispers something in Joey’s ear.)
 Chandler:I got it! Scotch… tape. (They’re right.)
 Chandler:Well we used there’s up last night making scary faces.
 Chandler:All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
 Chandler:Fears and Pet Peeves.
 Chandler:His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
 Chandler:She has a real name.
 Chandler:Althea?! What are you doing?!
 Chandler:You're shooting with Althea?!
 Chandler:Nice shooting!
 Chandler:Actually it’s Miss Chinandolor Bong.
 Chandler:Unfortunately that is correct.
 Chandler:I majored in lightning rounds. All right we’re gonna destroy you.
 Chandler:Well I’m so confused as to what we’ve been doing so far…
 Chandler:Say 200?
 Chandler:(interrupting) All right hold on! If you win we give up the birds.
 Chandler:But if we win we get your apartment.
 Chandler:Okay. (Starts jumping around.)
 Chandler:Dangerous Liaisons.
 Chandler:Oh! (Whispers something in Joey’s ear and then in Ross’s ear.)
 Chandler:Fancy.
 Chandler:Fancy guest.
 Chandler:Thanks man.
 Chandler:You can’t just call Monica’s room.
 Chandler:Oh I would never bet this apartment. It’s too nice.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Yeah but I bet it works.
 Chandler:Well believe it baby!
 Chandler:I knew it!
 Chandler:Cool girl roommate.
 Chandler:Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
 Chandler:What?! What-what is it?!
 Chandler:I can’t believe we live here!
 Chandler:Okay she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
 Chandler:I know!!
 Chandler:Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?
 Chandler:Is it just me or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
 Chandler:Yeah it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
 Chandler:I’m totally screwed. Okay they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like So where’s your boyfriend what’s-his-name Chester? And she’ll go No-no-no it’s Chandler. And he’ll go Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
 Chandler:All right look look what am I gonna do?
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:So uh man are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
 Chandler:Yeah I know but…
 Chandler:Okay okay but don’t worry because we also have cereals muffins waffles and jams jellies and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.
 Chandler:I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means Joey told us what this means!
 Chandler:Come on it was like cousins having sex up there!
 Chandler:Oh I loved the play. You were great and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having sex with him.
 Chandler:Oh come on it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
 Chandler:Y’know I-I could see how this could happen y'know you’re up there every night you’re naked touching kissing.
 Chandler:Well you can understand given how we started.
 Chandler:Well that is what happened and I don’t even see you denying this!
 Chandler:Yeah well don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!
 Chandler:Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at the new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behind their backs. Chandler wonders into the girl’s apartment.) You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
 Chandler:I confronted her and she didn’t deny it! (Pause) I don’t live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)
 Chandler:Well I may be drunk but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie’s…
 Chandler:Yes! See you and I have always been like—(motions that they think the same.)
 Chandler:Did she call?
 Chandler:All right maybe I should call her.
 Chandler:Well yeah but y'know what-what if I was wrong?
 Chandler:Well y'know what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?
 Chandler:She did not have to tell me I saw the play and there was no heat. Back me up here Ross!
 Chandler:That’s not backing me up! Look you said with the off-stage and the heat and the onstage and the oy heat.
 Chandler:Oh my God!!
 Chandler:Hey. I just I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry. Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
 Chandler:Yeah I know I-I wish I had too but y’know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight and now we can move on. Y’know I know for me—(Notices a pair of men’s pants on the chair.) Nick’s pants?
 Chandler:Yeah. Well I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
 Chandler:Well she wasn’t sleeping with him.
 Chandler:She is now.
 Chandler:I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick with his rock hard pecs and his giant man-nipples! I hate him I hate her! Well I don’t hate her I love her. This is all my fault really.
 Chandler:Because I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called her after our big stupid fight she never would’ve gone out with Nick and they would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
 Chandler:You don’t have to stop having fun just because I’m here. Kathy didn’t cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well except you. (They hug and Chandler goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)
 Chandler:(opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would you give me one minute!! Please.
 Chandler:Y’know I can’t believe Kathy did this too me. I really thought that she was the one. I tell you what from now on I’m never getting out of this chair ever! Okay? From now on this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
 Chandler:That’s right! Where are the guys? I’m ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
 Chandler:They got a breakfast buffet.
 Chandler:Ooh let me talk to him!
 Chandler:Well can I just…
 Chandler:She’s shhing me! It’s my phone and she’s shhing me!
 Chandler:Ow!
 Chandler:Maybe she doesn’t hit him all the time.
 Chandler:Okay I’m going to go stand over there. (Points and moves into the living room.)
 Chandler:So y’know uh when’s he getting back?
 Chandler:Y’know I knew something like this was going to happen. (He starts to take off his pants revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)
 Chandler:Yes you can. You’re thinking about time you can’t go back in time.
 Chandler:(laughs) No you can’t.
 Chandler:You don’t want to be guys you’d be all hairy and wouldn’t live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)
 Chandler:Okay. (Starts to cry)
 Chandler:No thanks Mom!
 Chandler:Ahh come on! Y’know what—y’know what I think I’m just gonna go home and call Kathy.
 Chandler:No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I’m gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that I’m gonna get so drunk I’m gonna wanna call Janice
 Chandler:Ohhh!!
 Chandler:Oh yeah that was great. Thanks to you the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
 Chandler:All right well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:Stripping!
 Chandler:Okay look I’m gonna have to ask you all to leave.
 Chandler:Look forget it. We tried but Phase Three is a lost cause Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot and I couldn’t picture myself with any of them. (Sits back in disgust.)
 Chandler:(jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
 Chandler:I am totally picturing you with all those women!
 Chandler:Well I’m there too!
 Chandler:Stop it! You’re killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
 Chandler:Where I don’t want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
 Chandler:Come on let me see that smile.
 Chandler:Please?
 Chandler:I know I know but you’re gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
 Chandler:All right ladies here’s what we’re gonna do. (Points to a stripper.) You are gonna take off my clothes. (To another two strippers) You two go get the oils. (To another stripper) And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice Chandler’s the king! Chandler’s the king!
 Chandler:Oh that’s fine! Go with your instincts go with your instincts.
 Chandler:Come on! Would you please pay attention I could wake up at any moment!
 Chandler:What do you want from me I’ve never met the guy. So anyway Rachel I’m sorry you can’t stay (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (The cigarette guy starts rubbing Chandler’s back.) What are you doing? (The guy just nods) All right listen I’ve got to wake up!
 Chandler:Y'know I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And you said it was gonna be fun! (pause) Which it kinda is.  Also you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
 Chandler:That’s a mailman! That’s our mailman! (Waves to the mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?
 Chandler:Hey you know who used to have nails like that?
 Chandler:(entering with Janice in tow) Hello!
 Chandler:Isn’t this amazing?
 Chandler:Okay. Bye.
 Chandler:Bye.
 Chandler:Bye.
 Chandler:B-bye!
 Chandler:Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After it’s closed) I can’t stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked Joey is relieved.)
 Chandler:Yeah I know but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice her laugh her personality—Well they’re all back! Y’know? And she’s picked up like nine new ones!
 Chandler:Don’t worry about it. I’m taking care of it tonight. (Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)
 Chandler:(standing in the door of the fridge) Well I don’t have to break up with her this time. We’re not involved! I’m going to do a pre-emptive strike! I’m going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the fridge.)
 Chandler:Yes I-I know that you do but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
 Chandler:(laughs) Okay we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship…
 Chandler:Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
 Chandler:I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately my company is transferring me overseas!
 Chandler:No! No! Not Paris.
 Chandler:Okay could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen. That’s right yes I’m being transferred to Yemen!
 Chandler:I don’t know exactly.
 Chandler:But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow.
 Chandler:Y’know uh you didn’t really have to help me pack.
 Chandler:Well I-I thought I did but I-I guess I did not!
 Chandler:Oh I’m packing. Y’know I’m-I’m packing ‘cause I’m moving to Yemen tomorrow.
 Chandler:I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen it’s the only way I can get rid off her.
 Chandler:(to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey trade lives with me!
 Chandler:(from his bedroom) Thanks!
 Chandler:Y’know you really didn’t have to take me to the airport.
 Chandler:Well we’re really not that close. (Pause) Okay so I guess this is uh good-bye then.
 Chandler:Okay. Then I guess it’s just wait here then. (Hands her the sign that says Wait Here.) (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no no. No no no I just I just need a pretend ticket.
 Chandler:What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
 Chandler:No. All right y’know what she’s (Points to Janice) gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card.
 Chandler:(to the ticket agent) American Express?
 Chandler:Well I-I guess I gotta go.
 Chandler:Well just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
 Chandler:Okay good-bye. Good-bye.
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
 Chandler:Well I then guess I’m going to Yemen! I’m going to Yemen! (To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen can I stay with you?
 Chandler:Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
 Chandler:What are you writing?
 Chandler:Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua give me a call sometime guys like you (Pause) never go out of style—what did you throw away?
 Chandler:Hi guys!
 Chandler:Without me?!
 Chandler:Yes but in Ross’s case they both know in two weeks that’s it.
 Chandler:Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!
 Chandler:What are you talking about?
 Chandler:Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to the living room.)
 Chandler:Like what?
 Chandler:I said Like what?
 Chandler:Does for me.
 Chandler:Flashdance.
 Chandler:She was a welder.
 Chandler:What are the odds? What are the odds?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away giving the sandwich to Phoebe.)
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh-ho yeah!
 Chandler:Treeger’s snaking the shower drain.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Do we pay for this?
 Chandler:Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill—free phone sex.
 Chandler:Yeah Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just came on!
 Chandler:Like finding money with naked people on it!
 Chandler:We don’t know what could make this go away.
 Chandler:And no one touches the air around the TV!
 Chandler:We still have porn.
 Chandler:Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.
 Chandler:It’s the theme from Good Will Humping.
 Chandler:Oh-oh yeah and did he also say that ah some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
 Chandler:They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
 Chandler:Whoa-whoa wait a minute did you say you love her?
 Chandler:All right look forget it forget it. You told her you love her it’s over.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Okay. (Pause) Good one.
 Chandler:Hi! Listen can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In Again.
 Chandler:Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
 Chandler:Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
 Chandler:What’s the second part of your plan?
 Chandler:You put your fist through the wall?
 Chandler:A place where no one will ever get out alive?
 Chandler:Are we in London?
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:I was just at the bank and there was this really hot teller and she didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
 Chandler:What no Nice apartment I bet the bedrooms are huge?
 Chandler:Y’know what we have to turn off the porn.
 Chandler:All right ready?
 Chandler:Two.
 Chandler:Yeah that’s kinda a relief.
 Chandler:You wanna see if we still have it?
 Chandler:FREE PORN!!!
 Chandler:We have free porn here!!!
 Chandler:Hey! Wow it is true what they say pregnant bellies look like a drum.
 Chandler:All right.
 Chandler:Wouldn’t that be Frank the III?
 Chandler:Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
 Chandler:Well it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
 Chandler:Hey y’know what if you’re gonna do that if you’re gonna name him Joey you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesn’t think so.) Oh come on! Chandler’s funny sophisticated and he’s very loveable once you get to know him.
 Chandler:Well Chandler will be there for you too. I mean well he might be a little late but-but he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda if want you need him for is that you’re really hot.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:And now you’re giving me the message!
 Chandler:You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
 Chandler:Hi! Hi! You’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
 Chandler:Raymond Chandler.
 Chandler:Okay there are no famous Joey’s. Except for huh Joey Buttafucco.
 Chandler:Okay look Joey! Come on think about it first of all he’ll never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey.
 Chandler:Wow you’re you’re right. I have a horrible horrible name.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:No no you’re right it is a ridiculous name!
 Chandler:Yes it is! From now on I have no first name.
 Chandler:I have no name.
 Chandler:Okay uh for now temporarily you can call me Clint.
 Chandler:Okay so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
 Chandler:It’s Clint. It’s Clint! (He heads for his bedroom.)
 Chandler:It’s Clint! Clint!
 Chandler:(entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark or a John?
 Chandler:All right look am I serious okay? Tomorrow at 330 I am going down to the courthouse.
 Chandler:Hey look this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay it’s probably why kids picked on me in school and why I never do well with women… So as of 4 o’clock tomorrow I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
 Chandler:(pleased) Really?!
 Chandler:Okay. Thanks.
 Chandler:You wanna hug it out?
 Chandler:Yay!
 Chandler:Okay!

 Chandler:Yeah we do!
 Chandler:Are you serious?
 Chandler:Forget it! Okay I’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
 Chandler:No. But uh Joey has and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
 Chandler:(ignoring him) Yes Gunther can I get two cups of chino please?
 Chandler:Forget it! Okay I’m not giving up the apartment.
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:You do know that Wham broke up?
 Chandler:Where is Emily?
 Chandler:Man didn’t she like just get here?
 Chandler:Easy tiger.
 Chandler:So what are you going to do?
 Chandler:Are you serious?
 Chandler:Because you’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay I’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with!
 Chandler:And I love the milk! But I’m not gonna some British girl to move in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey you say things now.
 Chandler:Okay no problem just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
 Chandler:No thank you.
 Chandler:Look I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay but we can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here! Didn’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
 Chandler:Look the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
 Chandler:Screw the Knicks!
 Chandler:I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
 Chandler:And the Knicks rule all.
 Chandler:No. No. We’re not gonna do that y’know why? Because its not an even trade.
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:Op op I’m convinced!
 Chandler:All right but you can’t use that again for a whole year. I’m in.
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Fine let’s do it.
 Chandler:Okay you guys uh you guys pick first
 Chandler:That’s a low one!
 Chandler:Why are you screaming and hugging?
 Chandler:Yeah baby!
 Chandler:Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) That’s courtside baby!
 Chandler:No they didn’t!
 Chandler:Those were like the best seats ever.
 Chandler:Oh yeah that’s very nice. Plus y’know they were free and they’re too small.
 Chandler:Oh. Oh God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head cut off.)
 Chandler:I KNOW!!!
 Chandler:Open up! Open up! Open up!
 Chandler:What the hell is going on?!
 Chandler:We are switching back right now!
 Chandler:Well you’re gonna have to leave sometime because you both have jobs and as soon as you do we’re switching it back! There’s nothing you can do to stop us! Right Joe?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:I don’t care this is our apartment! And they stole—you stole it—our apartment and we won that apartment fair and square twice! And I am getting it back right now. I’m getting back right now!
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no no more offers. You can’t offer anything to us!
 Chandler:Totally worth it!
 Chandler:Good night.
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Oh well that’s great!
 Chandler:Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
 Chandler:Oh. Oh did-did-did I wake you?
 Chandler:Gunther can I get another cup of coffee please? (Gunther starts to pour him another cup.) So uh what do you do when you’re not working here?
 Chandler:Oh okay thanks. (He goes back to the couch and rejoins Monica Joey and Phoebe.)
 Chandler:Well I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I’m exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
 Chandler:It’s not something to be proud of okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
 Chandler:They don’t have those.
 Chandler:Next time you snore I’m rolling ya over!
 Chandler:Hey all right!
 Chandler:Oh she’s got you running errands y’know picking up wedding dresses… (Laughs and makes like Indiana Jones and his whip) Wah-pah!
 Chandler:Y’know whipped! Wah-pah!
 Chandler:That’s what I did. Wah-pah!
 Chandler:All right buddy time to roll over. (Rolls him over and discovers a surprise) (Looking down) No-no! (Covers his eyes) No no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You’re going to a clinic and a pyjama store!
 Chandler:It’s 600.
 Chandler:Hey I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily and I think that’s I think that’s really cool.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Yeah well I don’t dance at weddings.
 Chandler:Because weddings are a great place to meet women and when I dance I look like this… (Starts to dancing really really really badly. Ross enters behind him and he stops.)
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Nothing.
 Chandler:(answering for him) Yes he did.
 Chandler:(waking Joey) Hey check out that girl! She is really hot!
 Chandler:You’re coming on to the entire room! (He goes over to pick up a stack of magazines next to her and to get her attention he throws them back down.) I’m Chandler.
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:You mind if I…
 Chandler:So uh what are you in for?
 Chandler:What a coincidence I listen in my sleep.
 Chandler:(entering) Hello! Little ones.
 Chandler:Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (They’re stunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out but uh she picked me.
 Chandler:Because I’m cooler.
 Chandler:Well she’s she’s the kinda girl—Joey was unconscious.
 Chandler:Plus you look cool.
 Chandler:Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
 Chandler:Phoebe is making people.
 Chandler:And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here would be by the ass print on this chair! Look we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
 Chandler:No-no not something stupid something huge.
 Chandler:Why not?! I mean it’s just it’s just climbing! It’s just it’s just steep!
 Chandler:We’re going to Everest! Okay it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
 Chandler:Yeah baby!
 Chandler:(dejected) Yeah well…
 Chandler:Yeah we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!
 Chandler:(dejected) Oh well…
 Chandler:Yeeeeahhhh.
 Chandler:But I’ll tell you something. One of these days we’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
 Chandler:And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
 Chandler:Uh-oh.
 Chandler:She was not good. Not good.
 Chandler:Uh-oh.
 Chandler:(entering) Hello!
 Chandler:(sarcastic) Noo.
 Chandler:I didn’t know that.
 Chandler:See maybe that’s the one we should’ve actually hidden.
 Chandler:This isn’t one of those uh y’know If she doesn’t come we-we don’t we don’t come? Right? Because I already bought my ticket…
 Chandler:Oh that's Ross's.
 Chandler:Come on Ross? Remember back in college when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
 Chandler:(stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
 Chandler:I KNEW IT!!!!
 Chandler:Ahh so how many cameras are actually on you?
 Chandler:All right check it out. Check this out. It says here that there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the book.) It’s almost as good as being there.
 Chandler:Well You could but... probably just the one time.
 Chandler:If we do that we gotta get Die Hard.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:(shocked) Yes! Yes! A thousand times yes!
 Chandler:Oh it’s awkward. It’s awkward. It’s awkward.
 Chandler:You can be the best man when I get married.
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no you—yeah of course you get to be my best man.
 Chandler:I’m not even getting married! Okay this is a question for science fiction writers!
 Chandler:I’m not even… I’m not even…
 Chandler:(entering) Hey guys what are you doing?
 Chandler:Yeah well good luck trying to top the last one.
 Chandler:Oh I’m Ross. I’m Ross. I’m too good for the Hut; I’m too good for the Hut.
 Chandler:See ya. (Ross exits and Chandler moves over next to Joey laughing.) Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
 Chandler:He just said No strippers.
 Chandler:(banging a spoon against his beer bottle) Okay a little announcement a little announcement. I’ve decided that my best man is my best friend Gunther!
 Chandler:Central Perk?
 Chandler:(banging on the bottle again) Okay okay a little announcement I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh (to the stripper) so is the position of the bride.
 Chandler:(opening the door) What?
 Chandler:Ugh. Just a sec give me a minute to wake up for this—Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You’re the worst best man ever!
 Chandler:You slept with the stripper?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:So you might say the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little squeeze.)
 Chandler:So you might say it’s a magic ring.
 Chandler:Well I think it all started when you said Hey Joey why don’t you be my best man.
 Chandler:Well what if we just ah called her used a fake name and had her come to my office?
 Chandler:(to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all turn there backs on her.)
 Chandler:Way to be cool man.
 Chandler:Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)
 Chandler:He will Joe.
 Chandler:Hey come on it’s not your fault.
 Chandler:No you should.
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:Thanks man.
 Chandler:What a baby.
 Chandler:Six-hour trip to London. That’s a lot of Monica.
 Chandler:You got your passport?
 Chandler:There it is.
 Chandler:(entering with Joey) All right! Let’s do it!
 Chandler:Okay ‘cause that’s not gonna get annoying.
 Chandler:Hey y’know what? I was wrong.
 Chandler:Hey! (Trots over)
 Chandler:Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebe’s book as Rachel comes in from her room.)
 Chandler:(entering with Phoebe’s book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
 Chandler:I am I’m ignoring you.
 Chandler:Oh what the hell is that?
 Chandler:Okay if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
 Chandler:Okay. Listen-listen we’re not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
 Chandler:I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.
 Chandler:To Put the Camera Away!!!
 Chandler:Well I don’t have to buy that I’m with stupid T-shirt anymore.
 Chandler:All right look you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?
 Chandler:How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?
 Chandler:Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
 Chandler:All right look if you insist on wearing that in public y’know you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
 Chandler:Okay wait. All right that’s it okay I’m out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box falls into a flower stand and walks away trying to be cool.)
 Chandler:Hey. (He nods at the hat.)
 Chandler:No-no-no y’know what? I really shouldn’t have said that you were embarrassing me I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel any better I’ve had a really lousy day.
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:That’s… That’s was…
 Chandler:How did you? How? How?
 Chandler:I’m gonna go to the bathroom.
 Chandler:That was pretty intense huh?
 Chandler:(glares at him) I hope he did!
 Chandler:Joey it’s been three days okay.. Your just a little homesick Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just just try to enjoy yourself.
 Chandler:I’d like to toast Ross and Emily. Of course my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast if you will. (No one in the room laughs. He starts to get flustered.) Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (Ross looks embarrassed.) And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he over inflated her. (He laughs. Jack looks at Judy and no one in the room laughs.) Ohh Dear God.. (A cellular phone rings.)
 Chandler:(Continuing his toast.) And I’m sure we’re all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think my friend getting married in Monty Hall. (No reaction from the people.) Ohh come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on you people!! All right forget it!! Congratulations Ross and Emily. (He sits down.)
 Chandler:Out loud?
 Chandler:So how are you doing?
 Chandler:The guy was hammered okay? There’s no way you look like Ross’s mother.
 Chandler:Because he’s crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
 Chandler:Ahh you know what? That is....Who wouldn’t want you?
 Chandler:(With the covers pulled up to his chin.) Morning Ross.
 Chandler:Yeah you are!!
 Chandler:Well I’ve-I’ve never done that with you before.
 Chandler:So ahh how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
 Chandler:Yes...Yes..Uh-huh You?(Looking over at her. She looks back.) We did you.
 Chandler:Oh yea yea absolutely.
 Chandler:I don’t want to look.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:(Very defensive.) I’m not seeing Monica.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Oh my god!
 Chandler:No!! Okay!! What’s with the third degree?! Why don’t you just shine a light in my eyes?! (Joey looks totally confused.)
 Chandler:Oh yea your right. It’s the second one.
 Chandler:What we did last night was....
 Chandler:Totally crazy stupid. (He nods his head at the people seated.)
 Chandler:I’m coming over tonight though right?
 Chandler:It could’ve been worse he could’ve shot her.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh wow I hope you don’t take this the wrong way but I know we had plans to meet up tonight and ugh I’m just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
 Chandler:Seven times!
 Chandler:In a foreign romantic country…
 Chandler:Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)
 Chandler:Well I don’t see that we have a choice. But when we’re back home we don’t do it.
 Chandler:Y’know I saw a wine cellar downstairs…
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Forget it that’s off.
 Chandler:The man’s got a point.
 Chandler:Listen in the middle of everything if I scream the word Yippee! just ignore me.
 Chandler:Oh hello Rachel.
 Chandler:Yes we do. But we have to change first.
 Chandler:Yeah we’ll be down in like five minutes.
 Chandler:Oh yay…
 Chandler:(To Monica) Hey listen why don’t we go change in my room?
 Chandler:Wow you look…
 Chandler:Well I’ve got a girl in here.
 Chandler:Well we’re-we’re hanging out in here!
 Chandler:Well I suppose I’d have to say you!! But what if we’re watching a movie in here?
 Chandler:Well Ross and Emily aren’t gonna use it.
 Chandler:Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn’t get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Nope not under here!
 Chandler:Well you couldn’t have looked everywhere or else you would’ve found her!
 Chandler:Yeah for about 30 minutes.
 Chandler:Wow in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)
 Chandler:Yeah we’re gonna go.
 Chandler:Yeah it’s a very large plane.
 Chandler:But we’ll stay here with you.
 Chandler:We have to leave for New York in an hour.
 Chandler:We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know let’s go for it.
 Chandler:Yeah it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something) Y’know technically we still are over international waters.
 Chandler:‘Kay!
 Chandler:Uhh no.
 Chandler:No.
 Chandler:Yes.
 Chandler:Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:No we didn’t!
 Chandler:Yes! Good thing we have that ‘Not in New York’ rule.
 Chandler:Right.
 Chandler:Oh. Y’know that night meant a lot to me too and it wasn’t because I was in a bad place or anything it just meant a lot to me ‘cause you’re really hot! Is that okay?
 Chandler:And I’m cute too.
 Chandler:Thank you! (They hug.) All right I gotta go unpack.
 Chandler:Bye.
 Chandler:(entering) I’m still on London time does that count?
 Chandler:Oh good! (They start kissing.)
 Chandler:Ehh you're just liquored up.
 Chandler:I've had a very long hard day.
 Chandler:Ahh no thanks. No chicken bye-bye then.
 Chandler:For the last time no! Get out! Get out Joey!
 Chandler:Are you okay? I'm so sorry he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
 Chandler:Hey Joe!
 Chandler:Yeah can I get a 3-piece some cole slaw some beans and a Coke-(Yelps in
 Chandler:Hey Pheebs!
 Chandler:Uh The Wheatsheaf.
 Chandler:Ooh! Ahh Pheebs was gonna tell a story.
 Chandler:I can't believe she can out run you man!
 Chandler:Oh Ross when you make out card; be sure to make it out to EM-I-LY.
 Chandler:Oh that's not true.
 Chandler:Okay I gotta go to work.
 Chandler:And uh Rachel glad to have you back.
 Chandler:Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe who is also stunned.) Always a pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)
 Chandler:All right y'know what we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
 Chandler:I got caught up and work but I'm quitting tomorrow.
 Chandler:So thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over grabs her and kisses her.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly grabs her and kisses her.)
 Chandler:Well I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. (Gets up to leave.)
 Chandler:I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
 Chandler:Hey Pheebs!
 Chandler:Okay Pheebs we decided the picnic idea was a little… Y'know it didn't have any… It-it well it blew. So we thought that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to Atlantic City!
 Chandler:Atlantic City!
 Chandler:Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
 Chandler:I know it's beautiful. Amazing.
 Chandler:Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
 Chandler:No.
 Chandler:Okay. (They kiss again.)
 Chandler:That's right.
 Chandler:Oh no.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Hey! You okay?
 Chandler:Did he just say he loves Fonzie?
 Chandler:All right…
 Chandler:Yeah that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month they give you 2% financing.
 Chandler:Really? Male nurses?
 Chandler:So they're going on dates? When?
 Chandler:This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too is that uh is that another doctor?
 Chandler:All right.
 Chandler:(spotting her) Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
 Chandler:Oh is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah Joey already told me and I am so-so fine. I mean you and I we're just y'know we're nothing we're goofin' around.
 Chandler:Fine! Maybe I will too!
 Chandler:So Dan nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
 Chandler:Oh.
 Chandler:Sure. (Pause) And listen thanks for doing that for us by the way. (Retreats in defeat.)
 Chandler:(to another female nurse) Hey how 'bout it? You me Saturday night?
 Chandler:All right. Very good.
 Chandler:Bye momi-moo.
 Chandler:Yes!
 Chandler:Oh God kindergarten flashback.
 Chandler:Okay keep saying it!
 Chandler:So are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
 Chandler:Y'know I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary… Well I have and the technical definition is two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me then we have to y'know get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
 Chandler:Really? Okay so…
 Chandler:Y'know I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
 Chandler:Right!
 Chandler:So uh now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl what are they gonna name her?
 Chandler:That's kind of a masculine name don't you think?
 Chandler:(entering happily with a bottle of champagne thinking that Monica is the only one there) Ha-ha-ha-(sees everyone)-enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no-no-no-no vomit tux! No-no vomit tux!
 Chandler:Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
 Chandler:Uhh yeah. She uh she uh she uh might've mentioned him.
 Chandler:Yeah I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
 Chandler:Really?! That's what you heard? (To Monica) You said that?
 Chandler:Because I'm very happy for him! (To Monica) And you you lucky dog!
 Chandler:Yes!
 Chandler:(entering) Hey Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
 Chandler:If you're cooking on the stove does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
 Chandler:Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had I'd be going like this. (He jumps up onto the table and starts doing his happy dance.)
 Chandler:Yes!
 Chandler:Well you can't just not see Rachel anymore she's one of your best friends.
 Chandler:That's true!
 Chandler:That's true!
 Chandler:Hey there he is! There he is!
 Chandler:How many times have I told you guys you never watch the cooking channel!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Oh that was yours? Uh yeah we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
 Chandler:Expect it in 4-6 weeks. (She starts to leave.) Umm hey umm Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day we have the whole place to ourselves.
 Chandler:Well I just thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:What's your point?
 Chandler:(entering) Look maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best it's only because you've made me the best.
 Chandler:I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you and we're together OH…MY…GOD.
 Chandler:Oh-aw my God! Now I understand if you never want to sleep with me again but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it to sex!
 Chandler:Well I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts to take off her latex gloves.) Oh no-no-no leave the gloves on.
 Chandler:Yeah why don't we lose the gloves.
 Chandler:All right let's show them how it's done.
 Chandler:Y'know that wasn't part of it?
 Chandler:Nope.
 Chandler:(quietly) Hi! (They both start kissing.)
 Chandler:Uhh 9. (He pushes the clock into the sink.)
 Chandler:I know me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
 Chandler:Yeah I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
 Chandler:Okay y'know your not though. Let's go. (He starts for his bedroom.)
 Chandler:I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
 Chandler:What's going on?
 Chandler:Uh hey!
 Chandler:We're flipping Monica's mattress.
 Chandler:Aww man! (They go into Monica's room.)
 Chandler:Oh yes somebody just said Can you hear anything?
 Chandler:Condoms?
 Chandler:And condoms are the way to do that?
 Chandler:(jumping on the bed) I can't believe it! We're here!
 Chandler:Oh you should live with Joey Roll-os everywhere.
 Chandler:Oh yes! Monica get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
 Chandler:(looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God they gave us glasses!
 Chandler:Okay but let's do it now though because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)
 Chandler:Okay great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)
 Chandler:Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
 Chandler:What? Why?
 Chandler:Uh-huh. (He doesn't take his eyes off the TV.)
 Chandler:(turning to face her) Yeah.
 Chandler:I hear ya Mugsy! But look all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect magical weekend together with you.
 Chandler:(watching TV in fact ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
 Chandler:Oh I'm sorry am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
 Chandler:Oh who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
 Chandler:Do not speak ill of the dead.
 Chandler:I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez relax mom.
 Chandler:I said Geez relax Monnnnn.
 Chandler:Damn Rollos!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know the entire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another Rollo)
 Chandler:Uh no I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
 Chandler:Well maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
 Chandler:Monica. (Follows her out.)
 Chandler:Okay fine $300.
 Chandler:Yeah just think of it as $25 per room!
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:Okay Ross is in the bathroom.
 Chandler:Kip my old roommate y'know we all used to hang out together.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:Yes that was mine.
 Chandler:Yes that would have made more sense.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked huh?
 Chandler:So I guess this is over.
 Chandler:Well y'know you and me it had to end sometime.
 Chandler:Because of the weekend we had a fight.
 Chandler:So this isn't over?
 Chandler:Really? Okay. Great!
 Chandler:(stops her) We're in a relationship?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Joey can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to drag Joey into Monica's room.)
 Chandler:Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.)
 Chandler:It happened in London.
 Chandler:The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
 Chandler:No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
 Chandler:Fun's over!
 Chandler:Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
 Chandler:Sorry.
 Chandler:Hello!
 Chandler:Yeah just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.) That didn't happen I made that up!
 Chandler:Okay but don't you think this is a little extreme?
 Chandler:Yeah I know we're losing Ross Joey said hence…
 Chandler:You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
 Chandler:So you're really okay with this?
 Chandler:Now that's so funny because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
 Chandler:Okay what is in here? Rocks?
 Chandler:So rocks.
 Chandler:Look we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
 Chandler:Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
 Chandler:Well I think it's very brave what you said.
 Chandler:Pheebs what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
 Chandler:Uh Ross?
 Chandler:Yeah we are so sorry.
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:Oh yeah there-there she is!
 Chandler:Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
 Chandler:That's a pig.
 Chandler:Hey! (Joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
 Chandler:Oh yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
 Chandler:He thought you said gonad.
 Chandler:Love what you've done with the place.
 Chandler:Oh yeah!
 Chandler:Oh the tears are real.
 Chandler:What are you doing?
 Chandler:You built a fort didn't ya?
 Chandler:(notices something) Oh my God the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)
 Chandler:I hate this thing!
 Chandler:(entering) Hello children!
 Chandler:Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)
 Chandler:Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
 Chandler:You mean this. (Does the maneuver perfectly.)
 Chandler:(gasps) All right look y'know this maybe tough but come on this is Ross! I survived college with him!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:No-no-no-no!
 Chandler:Okay so he's out of here.
 Chandler:Well I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
 Chandler:Not even on page 7?
 Chandler:What about that circled one?
 Chandler:Yes it is.
 Chandler:There we go!
 Chandler:Let's go quicker.
 Chandler:Yeah well look at this kitchen slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
 Chandler:Yeah you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
 Chandler:It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
 Chandler:We are bad people.
 Chandler:Yes that was a nice place!
 Chandler:Not a lot of closet space but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
 Chandler:What are we gonna do?
 Chandler:About Ross!
 Chandler:(grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh barks into the night. (Listens.) Well who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah he's a tap dancer! (Listens.) Yes some would say that is a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp! (Listens.) There you go! Yes he's a pimp. He's a big tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello?
 Chandler:Ohhhhh!
 Chandler:98. 99. 100. Okay go!
 Chandler:Here we go! Here we go!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:You're kidding no!
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:Yes! Ross you have to stay!
 Chandler:All right buddy!
 Chandler:Well I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
 Chandler:All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?
 Chandler:That's sweet Joey.
 Chandler:Are you aware that you're still talking?
 Chandler:No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
 Chandler:It's a tradition like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay moved out and abandoned its entire family.
 Chandler:Really? Worse than More turkey Mr. Chandler?
 Chandler:It's exactly like it sounds.
 Chandler:Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him but Chandler is in the doorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)
 Chandler:I'm over here big guy.
 Chandler:(laughing) You did look like an idiot.
 Chandler:Oh come on Monica reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know for me anyway. And of course the Indians.
 Chandler:(seeing her) Okay.
 Chandler:Well as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it I'm in.
 Chandler:Oh yeah it was great. You should be a chef.
 Chandler:Emotional Knapsack?
 Chandler:Right on! Oh! Uh but don’t take to long okay? 'Cause uh we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight right Clifford Alverez.
 Chandler:Dude don't do that too me!
 Chandler:No it's not that I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
 Chandler:I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
 Chandler:I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
 Chandler:I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so so sorry.
 Chandler:We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
 Chandler:Yeah we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:You just you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
 Chandler:Sorry!
 Chandler:Sorry.
 Chandler:Monica I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Are you all right?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Without my toe?! I need my toe!
 Chandler:That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
 Chandler:That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
 Chandler:Yeah well I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (He storms out.)
 Chandler:I can't believe this.
 Chandler:Yeah well sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
 Chandler:Yeah just leave me alone for a while. (He goes into his apartment.)
 Chandler:Oh-oh I'm a duck! I go Quack quack! I’m happy all the time!
 Chandler:Nice try.
 Chandler:Look Monica…
 Chandler:This is not going to work.
 Chandler:You are so great! I love you!
 Chandler:Nothing! I said I said You're so great and then I just I just stopped talking!
 Chandler:No I didn't!
 Chandler:No I didn't!
 Chandler:No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
 Chandler:Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another but can't) I'm out.
 Chandler:Well they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
 Chandler:See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:(interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too.
 Chandler:Well yeah actually.
 Chandler:I know it sounds really weird but we're just so bad at relationships.
 Chandler:Help!
 Chandler:Hi Pheebs!
 Chandler:I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
 Chandler:Well what did the police say?
 Chandler:Ross it's just a sandwich!
 Chandler:(reading) Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch who? Ross Geller's lunch please don't take me. Okay?
 Chandler:Say Ross when you picture Phoebe living on the street is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
 Chandler:What is going on here?
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:No-no wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your (Thinks) adult film class.
 Chandler:Oh—I don't know.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:(gasps) You're naked in this picture!
 Chandler:Ross?
 Chandler:Which I may say right now is out of control.
 Chandler:And you're okay with that?
 Chandler:(Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)
 Chandler:All right look! Look. I think I can explain this.
 Chandler:Joey's a sex addict.
 Chandler:Well let's….let's see what everybody thinks of that?
 Chandler:Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
 Chandler:(Answering the phone at work) Hello Chandler Bing.
 Chandler:(Angrily) Alright whoever this is stop calling me! (Ross and Joey laugh silently.) It’s been six months! It’s not funny!
 Chandler:Leave me alone! For the love of God leave me alone!!! (Joey hangs up.)
 Chandler:The British are coming?
 Chandler:Ohh.
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:Yes! Chandler Bing 7! Chandler Bing 0.
 Chandler:Okay I'll stop.
 Chandler:You wanna play?
 Chandler:Well so play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
 Chandler:I'm intrigued.
 Chandler:Okay but be careful okay because I wanna get our security deposit back.
 Chandler:Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
 Chandler:(entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven mitts) Oh yeah it's great! See you take a tennis ball a bowl and some lighter fluid—Op! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)
 Chandler:(entering from his bedroom) Guys come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on Joe!
 Chandler:Well why can't you do them tomorrow?
 Chandler:(To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit he'll get some work done.
 Chandler:The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
 Chandler:Oh so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
 Chandler:I paid for those tickets!
 Chandler:Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)
 Chandler:When did that happen to you?!
 Chandler:Oh yeah. First off all chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
 Chandler:Okay bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!
 Chandler:I don't believe they're brother and sister.
 Chandler:Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street you wanna go down there and give them a project ruin their day?
 Chandler:Great! Now we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!
 Chandler:Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
 Chandler:All right. (Takes a copy.)
 Chandler:What is up?
 Chandler:No it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
 Chandler:Could I be more sorry. (Looks at Joey.)
 Chandler:(To Ross) I'm sorry too.
 Chandler:I am sorry Ross.
 Chandler:This took you all day?!
 Chandler:(deadpan standing next to Monica) We're very happy for you.
 Chandler:We wanted to kiss at midnight but nobody else is going to so y'know…
 Chandler:(To Monica) Happy New Year!
 Chandler:Do you want us to leave the room or?
 Chandler:That's good one too Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
 Chandler:I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what paying me the 50 bucks could be the new thing you do that day! (Ross looks at him.) And it starts right now!
 Chandler:Nice!
 Chandler:(reading it) Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
 Chandler:Horn-swoggle.
 Chandler:No. No I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. (Sits down rubbing his temple.)
 Chandler:What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing I myself find it regular.
 Chandler:(notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause no one speaks.) Someone comment on the pants!
 Chandler:That's not what I had in mind! See people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see they're very tight. (Motions to Ross's buttock.) Maybe there's something in that area.
 Chandler:Oh come on!! (Storms out.)
 Chandler:(on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Oh yeah me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. (Smells it.) Yep.
 Chandler:(entering) Oh good okay I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross phone call for you today Tom Jones he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?! (He sits down and sighs in relief.)
 Chandler:Sorry man.
 Chandler:Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
 Chandler:Oh we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
 Chandler:I know I can do this. (He takes her hand.)
 Chandler:I asked myself that very question sir. Uh (Points to Monica) this is Monica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss Doug. Doug this is Monica.
 Chandler:No sir.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Oh that was my work laugh.
 Chandler:Oh believe me to survive this party you're gonna have to come up with one too.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
 Chandler:And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. (She glares at him.) Strip church. Anyway I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
 Chandler:Oh I used too but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at…bigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) Hey Rach do you have a tennis racquet?
 Chandler:Okay good luck with that. (Exits.)
 Chandler:Okay easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
 Chandler:Let them win one.
 Chandler:You're not even giving them a chance!
 Chandler:Oh yes sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? (Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!
 Chandler:Oopsey missed it!
 Chandler:Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)
 Chandler:Yeah at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashed racquet from his bag.)
 Chandler:It was my racquet.
 Chandler:If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
 Chandler:Okay y'know what because you said that I'm not putting out tonight.
 Chandler:Just a little bit of sugar.
 Chandler:Oh you get used to it.
 Chandler:So I laugh at my boss's jokes what's the big deal?
 Chandler:Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Well I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
 Chandler:Well I just…
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you Monica.
 Chandler:Coffee in a fight! (Does the laugh again.)
 Chandler:(from his bedroom) All right so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
 Chandler:But we're not ready to tell yet!
 Chandler:Man she is really gullible.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Why would I be mad?
 Chandler:(realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said all on the list there. Well but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
 Chandler:I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
 Chandler:And I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) seven dollars. No strings attached. Now if you can't remember that I think we should write it down—let's write it down!
 Chandler:Oh! Look at that time's up! My turn!
 Chandler:It's your timer.
 Chandler:All right then massage me up right nice!
 Chandler:Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
 Chandler:It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
 Chandler:Good-bye muscles!!
 Chandler:I'm telling you she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just—I didn't know what it was!
 Chandler:Look for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know telling the truth.
 Chandler:(examining the hat) And the bunny got away. (Turns and starts looking for the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)
 Chandler:And you're gonna make them all disappear.
 Chandler:Done.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
 Chandler:Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:And a date with a man!
 Chandler:(wincing) Yes he is!
 Chandler:I'm sorry but ow-owww-owww!
 Chandler:Hey is Rachel here?
 Chandler:(coming all the way in) Listen I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
 Chandler:(falling into that trap) I don't like your massages.
 Chandler:Okay but now see you're crying!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:It's okay you don't have to be the best at everything.
 Chandler:Okay you give the worst massages in the world.
 Chandler:Okay hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves Who's the best of that? They'd have to go to you.
 Chandler:Oh it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
 Chandler:Absolutely!
 Chandler:Yeah! (They hug.)
 Chandler:Hey man how did the audition go?
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Oh hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)
 Chandler:Yeah umm they're called wallets.
 Chandler:And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
 Chandler:Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
 Chandler:(entering) Hello children!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:Well I try to y'know squeeze things. (Phoebe giggles uncontrollably.) Are you okay?
 Chandler:Phoebe it's me. You can tell me anything.
 Chandler:What's going on?
 Chandler:Well my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
 Chandler:Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
 Chandler:The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house I think I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
 Chandler:I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
 Chandler:Ow!
 Chandler:Oh y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
 Chandler:No I didn't misunderstand okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
 Chandler:Well it's not flexed right now!
 Chandler:Sure I'll do it with ya.
 Chandler:That new mountain bike?
 Chandler:Your work makes me sad.
 Chandler:(after they've left) Okay did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
 Chandler:Okay so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
 Chandler:Are you serious?
 Chandler:(a little hurt) Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps—She knows!
 Chandler:(entering) Joey!
 Chandler:Phoebe knows about us!
 Chandler:Oh man!
 Chandler:Ahh yes the messers become the messies!
 Chandler:Hello Phoebe I've been thinking about you all day. (He's holding the phone so that Monica can hear it as well.)
 Chandler:Well you know that thing you said before I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
 Chandler:Yeah listen Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
 Chandler:Oh yeah they're totally gonna back down!
 Chandler:(initially worried but gets over it) Really?
 Chandler:Yes.
 Chandler:Okay listen how far am I gonna have to go with her?
 Chandler:How do you know?!
 Chandler:At this?!
 Chandler:Phoebe.
 Chandler:Come on in.
 Chandler:Sure.
 Chandler:Me? No. You?
 Chandler:So do I.
 Chandler:I'm gonna put on some music.
 Chandler:You look good.
 Chandler:Well why don't we move this into the bedroom?
 Chandler:Oh do you not want to?
 Chandler:(swallowing hard) Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
 Chandler:Listen this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
 Chandler:Look she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)
 Chandler:Okay give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
 Chandler:Oh you're-you're going?
 Chandler:(swallowing hard) It's very very nice. Well come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
 Chandler:Not if I kiss you first.
 Chandler:Well I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
 Chandler:Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
 Chandler:Because I'm in love with Monica!!
 Chandler:Love her! That's right I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you Monica.
 Chandler:And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. (Pause) And might I say your breasts are still showing.
 Chandler:Yes and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Wow! Listen we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So good-bye take care bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)
 Chandler:Oh I'm going on the lamb.
 Chandler:Well I think I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
 Chandler:Look we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay I'm in love with her.
 Chandler:(interrupting) Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
 Chandler:Yeah big zero gravity moon steps.
 Chandler:Hey listen come on Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
 Chandler:(To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.
 Chandler:Very very funny but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
 Chandler:Wh-wh-why?!
 Chandler:Yeah so what's that supposed to mean?!
 Chandler:I don't see it that way. Okay? Because I see two Monicas the one that was my friend who lived across the hall and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica who I just started to date. Now who's to say what she wants?! I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?
 Chandler:Okay. It's not different at all is it?
 Chandler:Hmm.
 Chandler:Yeah here somewhere else y'know where-where ever. (Gets up.)
 Chandler:Yeah I'm cool. Casual.
 Chandler:I'm just hanging out. Y'know having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:Well you do want all that stuff right?
 Chandler:Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
 Chandler:Oh please you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
 Chandler:Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
 Chandler:Well I did not know that.
 Chandler:It's gonna be okay right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is this is fixable.
 Chandler:By me?
 Chandler:Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)
 Chandler:Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
 Chandler:Well that's what we do. Y'know I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
 Chandler:Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
 Chandler:I need to talk to you it's urgent!
 Chandler:Okay I've been doing a lot of thinking about us y'know a lot of uhh us thinking. And uh well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly and awkwardly gets down on one knee.)
 Chandler:(getting out a ring box) Monica…
 Chandler:Will you marry me?
 Chandler:I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
 Chandler:I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
 Chandler:No the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.) Will you be my wife?
 Chandler:Yeah I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
 Chandler:Yeah I know but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)
 Chandler:I didn't think I was!
 Chandler:Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door. (Points at the door.)
 Chandler:Okay how long is this going to go on.
 Chandler:That's not funny.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Oh we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey do you know a six-letter word for red?
 Chandler:Yeah I think that's wrong but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. (To Monica) Hey how about maroon?
 Chandler:Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Oh y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow his mother was shot by a hunter.
 Chandler:Okay but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
 Chandler:Hi Joe.
 Chandler:Oh come on! You've been acting strange all day!
 Chandler:Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! I don’t want to talk about it.
 Chandler:You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh that is so cool! (To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. (Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) I love you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)
 Chandler:No it can mean anything. Like uh all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
 Chandler:Joey look are you attracted to Monica? Right here right now are you attracted to her?
 Chandler:Well there you have it!
 Chandler:Well y'know Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
 Chandler:Oh yeah it's actually in my bedroom.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:Y'know I would be offended but Monica is freakishly strong so…
 Chandler:(looking at the sketch) Oh I see. I thought you just really really liked your new couch.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:(straining) Okay.
 Chandler:Okay I don't think we can turn anymore!
 Chandler:Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
 Chandler:Okay yeah I think it's really stuck now.
 Chandler:Oh y'know what did you mean when you said pivot?
 Chandler:(stopping him) Hey whoa-whoa! What's she like?
 Chandler:Ooh I do! I do! I do!
 Chandler:(To Rachel) He has a gun!
 Chandler:(entering) Hey Monica here's your broom back.
 Chandler:Oh hey how'd the interview go?
 Chandler:So what happened?
 Chandler:Well you coulda tried not kissing him.
 Chandler:Come on Rach.
 Chandler:I gotta check out this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizes something stops turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her and kisses her.)
 Chandler:(To Gary) So what do you say maybe sometime I hold your gun?
 Chandler:Oh what can happen? I mean would you… (He gestures and spills some of his coffee.)
 Chandler:Uh yeah.
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:Ohh so?
 Chandler:Monica you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this why? Get your coat.
 Chandler:That was amazing!
 Chandler:That was amazing.
 Chandler:No you're the best.
 Chandler:No you're the best.
 Chandler:Honey the tortilla chips know what you mean.
 Chandler:Oh yeah it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to the lining.) Now I gotta go Officer Bing has gotta 10-100. (Pause softly) That's pee-pee. (Heads for the bathroom.)
 Chandler:Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?
 Chandler:No. And if I did I don't think we'd be going out. Monica this is getting ridiculous!
 Chandler:Ugh we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
 Chandler:(gasps) So?
 Chandler:Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
 Chandler:Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth I'm more excited about where we are right now.
 Chandler:Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you yeah I think that's pretty exciting. (Kisses her.)
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
 Chandler:Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
 Chandler:Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy irrational screw up! (Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at him.) And now we're back.
 Chandler:(entering) You guys ready fore the movies?
 Chandler:Okay. (He picks the 9 of Spades)
 Chandler:Oh yes.
 Chandler:(pause) Yes.
 Chandler:Hi there!
 Chandler:That.
 Chandler:Hey Rach now that you're working at Ralph Lauren can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
 Chandler:Unwilling to steal from work interesting.
 Chandler:Dude! That's my girlfriend!
 Chandler:Weirder than watching his two moms make out? (Monica nods in agreement.)
 Chandler:Yeah it is the best.
 Chandler:Yeah or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
 Chandler:Yeah I wanna go to babe.
 Chandler:Ah sure. What's in 'em?
 Chandler:Oh good because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
 Chandler:Y'know I rued the day once…didn't get a whole lot else done.
 Chandler:(shocked) Well I mean let me get the door first. (Goes and opens the door.) Oh hi! No one. (Exits.)
 Chandler:Okay there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
 Chandler:Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
 Chandler:I wish I had smoked for my career…
 Chandler:Okay but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
 Chandler:I think you smell great! (He sniffs her shoulder.)
 Chandler:Great job with the cups Pheebs!
 Chandler:Awesome!
 Chandler:There are snow cones! (Monica glares at him.) Snow cones! Yuck!
 Chandler:Thank you! Thank you! (Runs to the snow cone machine.)
 Chandler:(to Kim and Nancy) Oh hi! Excuse me is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
 Chandler:Okay great.
 Chandler:I'll catch you guys later. (Exits.)
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary we've got reservations at Ja George.
 Chandler:Made a few calls pulled some strings and they agreed to seat us at 1130 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
 Chandler:Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
 Chandler:Yeah if that was true gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
 Chandler:Oh okay. (Hands her the money.) Here you go.
 Chandler:Oh he's in the back. The duck pissed him off said that eggs came first.
 Chandler:Okay bye!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:I was not flirting.
 Chandler:Okay first of all the impression uncanny. And second that was not flirting that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
 Chandler:You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to move towards Ross.)
 Chandler:I was not flirting.
 Chandler:I was not and oh God shh!
 Chandler:Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
 Chandler:So Joey on Law & Order you must be very proud!
 Chandler:I'm sorry I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She just stares at him.) I've done it again.
 Chandler:Happy Anniversary 10 months! (They kiss.)
 Chandler:Uhh Joey's grandmother is right there. (Points)
 Chandler:The one that doesn't.
 Chandler:Hey why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:If you said Big lima bean bubbling up. Would she understand the difference?
 Chandler:Here you go. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
 Chandler:You're welcome.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.
 Chandler:Really?!
 Chandler:(starts to laugh but then gets serious) So umm you-you flirt with guys all the time?
 Chandler:Okay but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
 Chandler:Yes it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel when you were going out with Ross did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
 Chandler:(smiling) Well what is it?
 Chandler:(smiling) If we keep talking this way aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
 Chandler:Doesn't know Hello. But she knows Capricorn One.
 Chandler:So uh Monica do you do you like the Law & Order?
 Chandler:See I'm finding out all this stuff about you today like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
 Chandler:Oh I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look I'm sorry some things are different for men and for women.
 Chandler:Okay I've already taught you so much already but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think I'm just flirting no big deal. But the guy is thinking Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!
 Chandler:It's true.
 Chandler:Again true.
 Chandler:All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
 Chandler:Uh Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to pantomime it for her.) Meanwhile let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So you're old and small.
 Chandler:Okay hold on. (Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)
 Chandler:(To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt we don't have a problem.
 Chandler:Oh the humanity.
 Chandler:More so than anything else.
 Chandler:Almost over man.
 Chandler:Why am I looking?
 Chandler:You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
 Chandler:(singing) Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown…engines…on!
 Chandler:(To Monica) Hey!
 Chandler:You ready?
 Chandler:You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
 Chandler:Let me see the earrings.
 Chandler:(looking at them) They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
 Chandler:(To Ross) Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
 Chandler:Hey man what's up?
 Chandler:Yeah yeah! Me too!
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Well I like danger.
 Chandler:Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
 Chandler:It is starting to get dark out there.
 Chandler:(laughing) Okay. (Deadpan) But it is officially nighttime.
 Chandler:Your tax dollars?
 Chandler:(leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich) Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
 Chandler:I can't smell your sandwich?
 Chandler:Okay I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joey just glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Sur-surprise him? We're not we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
 Chandler:How do you figure that?
 Chandler:Y'know when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It it sounds gay.
 Chandler:Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
 Chandler:Okay y'know we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
 Chandler:(deadpan) Oh hurry up. I want to sign that.
 Chandler:What's going on?
 Chandler:Uh HELLO!!
 Chandler:(pouting) It was a car backfire!
 Chandler:Who jumps at loud noises!
 Chandler:Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (He gets up and starts for the door.)
 Chandler:(returning) Oh my God! (Storms out.)
 Chandler:Oh I just went for a walk around the living room. Whatever…
 Chandler:No. No I'm just tired. Y'know from-from the walk.
 Chandler:You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
 Chandler:I do not hate Ross!
 Chandler:What picture?
 Chandler:Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire but y'know it could've been a bullet and you y'know you didn't try to save me!
 Chandler:When it comes down to it you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
 Chandler:From a bullet!
 Chandler:Much sense?!
 Chandler:So you risked your life for a sandwich!
 Chandler:So you didn't uh choose Ross before me.
 Chandler:Really?!
 Chandler:Thanks. (He grabs the sandwich.)
 Chandler:(with his mouthful) Oh-oi-ho yeah!
 Chandler:Hm-hmm. (Goes to take another bite.)
 Chandler:I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
 Chandler:Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
 Chandler:Yes if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Yeah see I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Hiya doin' pumpkin?
 Chandler:(terrified) Right because it's fast. Because it's so fast. It's fast!
 Chandler:Oh! Good for you Pheebs way to go! (Breathes a sigh of relief)
 Chandler:So what are you gonna do?
 Chandler:Me?! Why me?
 Chandler:I'll try but I'm not sure what good it would do y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
 Chandler:(To Phoebe behind Monica's back) Still terrified I'll take care of it. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her when she turns away he nods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)
 Chandler:Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.)
 Chandler:Gary I'm here to report a crime.
 Chandler:It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
 Chandler:Well I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe we should have a talk. Man to uh me.
 Chandler:Uh are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe you two are gonna be y'know live-living together!
 Chandler:You mean scared.
 Chandler:Scared? Happy?
 Chandler:I am trying to open your eyes my man! Don't you see if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home she's there. You go to bed she's there. You wake up and oh yes she's there!
 Chandler:Were you're parents happy or something?
 Chandler:Wow y'know when you say it it doesn't sound so scary.
 Chandler:Yeah I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
 Chandler:(pause) Yeah you're right about that.
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:Yes I did and I think you should do it.
 Chandler:He's a great guy y'know? And he loves you a lot you are a very lucky lady.
 Chandler:I’m sorry. (Pause) If you ask me I'd move in with him.
 Chandler:Hey Gar!
 Chandler:Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
 Chandler:All right let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in the game.)
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:I'm not a dropper!
 Chandler:It's throwing and catching!
 Chandler:Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball but loses control and almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)
 Chandler:Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
 Chandler:Yeah you almost overreacted to something.
 Chandler:Not fun anymore?
 Chandler:Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is you can work it out!
 Chandler:Oh that is over!
 Chandler:You guys wanna eat here?
 Chandler:Y'know how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football a mug of coffee the phone an apple a Frisbee a record and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his chest. I'm not going to describe them you'll have to see them.)
 Chandler:Oh Richard. That's all I ever hear Richard Richard Richard!
 Chandler:Okay so Richard Richard!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:How much did I love The King and I? (Oh you get the point by now.)
 Chandler:You okay there man?
 Chandler:Wow umm calm down.
 Chandler:Uh no Pheebs. What's it look like?
 Chandler:You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
 Chandler:Yeah I know that means buddy!
 Chandler:Well uh we can talk about that too Pheebs.
 Chandler:Whoa-whoa-whoa what are we going to do about my job?
 Chandler:All right great road trip baby! (To Monica) This okay with you?
 Chandler:Thank you.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:Yeah listen how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Hey so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
 Chandler:I see but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite right? I mean lead in a movie they must be paying you a lot?
 Chandler:So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
 Chandler:All right bye-bye now!
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:We've been driving for a half-hour and you haven't looked at the road once.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Isn't that Ross's money?
 Chandler:I don't know.
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Too dry.
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:Yes.
 Chandler:I also said Yes!
 Chandler:No! (Realizes) Ahhh!!!
 Chandler:Look Joe I just I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
 Chandler:They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
 Chandler:Joe I don't think this is going to be your big break.
 Chandler:Oh you don't want me on the trip?
 Chandler:All right I'll tell ya what the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
 Chandler:All right fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
 Chandler:You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
 Chandler:All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait there's no sidewalk! Yeah I'm gonna die here.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
 Chandler:I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
 Chandler:Well I don't know what mad him so mad y'know? All I said was that uh I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him and that uh y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
 Chandler:Oh I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
 Chandler:(who has just entered) Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
 Chandler:Y'know he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
 Chandler:That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of porn…
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:(To Phoebe) Is that Joey?! (She nods yes) Let me talk to him!
 Chandler:(To Phoebe) Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
 Chandler:(To Joey) Hey!
 Chandler:No-no-no-no I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
 Chandler:Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
 Chandler:Uh what was that?

 Chandler:So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
 Chandler:Yeah I guess it's a little better now.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Happy plane-aversary.

 Chandler:Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
 Chandler:What-what Richard thing?

 Chandler:(talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.
 Chandler:Oh yeah! Yeah so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)
 Chandler:Oh my God.
 Chandler:Love your condoms my man.
 Chandler:Why?! What happened?!
 Chandler:No-no that's okay apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
 Chandler:No! Her boyfriend Richard!
 Chandler:When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
 Chandler:Thanks. (They hug.)
 Chandler:(pushing her away from another hug) Next time?
 Chandler:There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
 Chandler:That's so funny because I think I just did!
 Chandler:Fine with me!
 Chandler:What are you talking…
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:(interrupting in the nick of time) Joey I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
 Chandler:Whoa!
 Chandler:Y'know if I won $5000 I'd join a gym y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick! (Mimics it.)
 Chandler:Good luck!
 Chandler:I see.

 Chandler:What's an identical hand twin?
 Chandler:Are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?
 Chandler:(totally confused) How?
 Chandler:Again I must go back to how?

 Chandler:No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:That was Joey!

 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:Okay. (He gets up and goes to find her.)
 Chandler:(walking by with his luggage) See you later Mon.
 Chandler:What does it look like? I'm going home.
 Chandler:Come on! I was there! (He's propped up with his hand on a statute of a naked guy. He winces and pulls his hand away.) I know he's the love of your life.
 Chandler:Really?!
 Chandler:Yeah I wanted to make a dramatic scene but I hate packing.
 Chandler:(arm-in-arm with Monica) Hey Pheebs!

 Chandler:Another hard 8.
 Chandler:Okay okay I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; (pause) and we get married here tonight.
 Chandler:You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
 Chandler:Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
 Chandler:Okay so if an eight comes up we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
 Chandler:Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
 Chandler:(spots one) Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
 Chandler:All right!
 Chandler:Here it is! Here it is!
 Chandler:It's a four.
 Chandler:Okay all right all right all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay here's something here's something blue and new.
 Chandler:Let's go! (Starts to leave.)
 Chandler:Ohh great I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
 Chandler:I don't think so.
 Chandler:(looks around) Here just…take this. (Hands her the sweater.)
 Chandler:No we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
 Chandler:Okay one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)
 Chandler:Hello! One marriage please!
 Chandler:(singing) Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
 Chandler:Oh that's The Wedding March. Does does that freak you out?
 Chandler:Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get married!
 Chandler:Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get married!
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Yes! Well that-yes.
 Chandler:We actually missed it.
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:So has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
 Chandler:It’s a buffet man.
 Chandler:Listen I gotta talk to you.
 Chandler:Monica and I almost got married last night.
 Chandler:Look I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y’know? And how do I tell her without crushing her?
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:(returning with Joey) Hi.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…
 Chandler:(not quite sure) You did.
 Chandler:Well I think I think Ross already has one. Now this one’s free right? Because you paid for the first two so the third one’s free.
 Chandler:I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!
 Chandler:So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
 Chandler:Yes we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay so say uh say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.
 Chandler:Sounds great.
 Chandler:Ready!
 Chandler:(deadpan) Yes yes eight.
 Chandler:That was so unlikely. Well let’s get married! I guess.
 Chandler:That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight no wedding! Damnit!
 Chandler:Yeah. (They go pack.) We’re doing the right thing right?
 Chandler:Well you did pull his hair.
 Chandler:I’m not getting into this again!
 Chandler: Well I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay. (He opens the door carries her across the threshold stops backs out and lets go of Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:All right should we just should we just get married? Y’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
 Chandler:Me too!
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:Jeez relax! It’s not like we’re mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)
 Chandler:(entering slowly) Y’know I was thinking what if I uh unpack here?
 Chandler:Well what if all my stuff was here?
 Chandler:Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?
 Chandler:Me asking is kind of a sign.
 Chandler:Okay!!!!!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Oh thanks.
 Chandler:The door hasn’t been locked in five years but okay! (Runs out.) Ready?!
 Chandler:Okay a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can’t get in!
 Chandler:This is not a sign!
 Chandler:It’s an old key!
 Chandler:I love you!
 Chandler:Are you hugging the door right now.
 Chandler:Yeah-yeah me neither.
 Chandler:The key’s stuck in the lock.
 Chandler:(trying the handle) It still doesn’t work.
 Chandler:Oh.
 Chandler:Nice job Joe! You’re quite the craftsmen.
 Chandler:Y’know when we move in together can I get a gumball machine?
 Chandler:No. When it comes to sweets he’s surprisingly strict.
 Chandler:No no I keep trying y’know? I can get out Joey I have too… but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with …go to the bathroom. He may think I’m sick.
 Chandler:Oh so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?
 Chandler:All right.
 Chandler:No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey here’s the thing Monica and I have decided to live together here. So I’m gonna be moving out man.
 Chandler:Look I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:(looking down) What gave me away?
 Chandler:Okay so that’s it everybody knows! It’s official we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
 Chandler:Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Hey listen for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.
 Chandler:Well I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…
 Chandler:(To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)
 Chandler:Rach…
 Chandler:Okay when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
 Chandler:Well Joey’s my best friend.
 Chandler:You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
 Chandler:Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches for one.)
 Chandler:Hey-hey!
 Chandler:I am now!
 Chandler:Okay bye! (Exits.)
 Chandler:Look I’m just gonna be across the hall we can still do all the same stuff.
 Chandler:Not once did we do that.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Oh yeah? Well how’d she take it?
 Chandler:And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?
 Chandler:Okay I gotta ask who calls us that?!
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:Pheebs I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
 Chandler:Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!
 Chandler:Who was it?
 Chandler:Sure!
 Chandler:Well I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200 the real ones! The big-big ones!
 Chandler:Okay so you mean no as in Gee Chandler what an interesting idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely.
 Chandler:So that’s it?
 Chandler:Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!
 Chandler:I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
 Chandler:No I’m not mocking you (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful guest room. (Exits.)
 Chandler:Nothing Monica and I had a stupid fight.
 Chandler:(reading the ad) Wanted. Female roommate non-smoker non-ugly. Nice!
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:Hi listen I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get girls and now I can ‘em—Now I have you. (Monica glares at him.) Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way I see women…
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:Ohh.
 Chandler:That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
 Chandler:We don’t have to come up with this now.
 Chandler:Hey y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?
 Chandler:Yeah I mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. (Kisses her and heads into the living room.)
 Chandler:Is that a problem?
 Chandler:Oh that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.
 Chandler:Okay I get it. So I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes and head off to work!
 Chandler:In the game room!
 Chandler:All right! That’s fine! That’s fine! I won’t bring over the chairs! I won’t bring anything over! I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma’s place!! (Storms out.)
 Chandler:(entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potential roommate) Hi! I’ll be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.)
 Chandler:Why did you take the shower curtain down?
 Chandler:Well why don’t you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mocks him and he joins in.)
 Chandler:Well we are fond of the silliness but we also have a soft spot for the love.
 Chandler:That’s laughter.
 Chandler:I don’t know.
 Chandler:Yeah I do.
 Chandler:He’s being silly because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
 Chandler:Yeah I'm not so worried.
 Chandler:Of course!
 Chandler:Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Oh my God! Someone’s killed Square Man!
 Chandler:Oh that’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!
 Chandler:Y’know those big-big uh road signs that say Merge?
 Chandler:Y’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because that’s you and I together! Merge!
 Chandler:Really?!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Oh what’s the matter?
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?
 Chandler:Oh hi!
 Chandler:Why don’t you open with a joke?
 Chandler:Wait a minute hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!
 Chandler:That’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Yes you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild.
 Chandler:(opens and reads it) Benefits lapsed.
 Chandler:Okay it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because you didn’t work enough last year.
 Chandler:All right.
 Chandler:I’m sorry man there’s never a good time to (pauses) stop catching on fire.
 Chandler:Okay make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:That’s great but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?
 Chandler:What’s wrong with you?
 Chandler:This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!
 Chandler:That’s a hernia.
 Chandler:Hey will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.) Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
 Chandler:I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!
 Chandler:Listen I’m really glad you got the part.
 Chandler:But are you sure you can do this?
 Chandler:Now is that never talking about it again?!
 Chandler:I’m sorry! Hey-hey Joe why don’t you uh lift up your shirt? (He does.) Take a look at this kiddo. (Alex finally starts crying.) We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
 Chandler:What are you doing?
 Chandler:Oh all right.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Okay let me just jump in and ask at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
 Chandler:Ross just for my own piece of mind you’re not married to anymore of us are ya?
 Chandler:You left a shoe here?!
 Chandler:Oh good when he comes back for his keys I’ll be sure to give him your shoe.
 Chandler:(not enthused) Yeah all right.
 Chandler:Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
 Chandler:Yeah I’m gonna pass. ‘Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
 Chandler:Little baby girl Chandler where I have heard that before? Oh right Coach Ruben. (Tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly smells something. It’s times like these I’m glad Smell-O-Vision hasn’t been invented.) Do you know what Pheebs? When you’re done over there we kinda have a situation over here too. (Phoebe is changing hers.)
 Chandler:See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
 Chandler:I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around… (He degrades into baby talk but he means when they grab his finger.)
 Chandler:Okay I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
 Chandler:What equity investments?
 Chandler:You don’t even have a car!
 Chandler:And?
 Chandler:There you are.
 Chandler:(entering) Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up they can meet Krog! (He holds up this Xena-like warrior action figure.)
 Chandler:He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
 Chandler:They’re not gonna swallow anything you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
 Chandler:Glass sand whatever. (Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to check on the babies again.)
 Chandler:(entering) All right. (Clears throat) I thought about it and maybe you’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
 Chandler:I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
 Chandler:Well I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat. (Mimics a cat trying to cough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)
 Chandler:But you found the keys to his clothes?
 Chandler:That is true.
 Chandler:Ahh I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.
 Chandler:I think that’s gum.
 Chandler:Okay listen this really hurts. Let’s go.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:Well let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
 Chandler:And protected them from a tornado?
 Chandler:Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph.
 Chandler:Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
 Chandler:(pause) Phoebe would you take a look at this mess!!!!
 Chandler:(watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick so that he’s scratching his back with it.) Listen I’m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
 Chandler:First of the month.
 Chandler:No just the months you actually want to live here.
 Chandler:Okay here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)
 Chandler:That’s our phone number. Now look I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover you for a while?
 Chandler:It’s not charity Joe…
 Chandler:Okay uh here’s the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)
 Chandler:Uh yeah.
 Chandler:So we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?
 Chandler:No I hope not! I tried to offer him some money but he wouldn’t take it.
 Chandler:I figure that $1500 would cover him for a few months y’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.
 Chandler:Well that would help the pride thing.
 Chandler:Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
 Chandler:Okay! (They kiss) So what do you girls have planned for tonight?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Well instead of just hanging out we figure we’d do nothing.
 Chandler:Oh nope I-I have plans with Joey.
 Chandler:Yes but for the last time.
 Chandler:He’s at a dinner party.
 Chandler:Oh I wish I’d know you were going to do that I ordered Chinese.
 Chandler:Say Joe I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh foosball for money?
 Chandler:Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
 Chandler:Okay let’s play! The big game Italy vs. China apparently.
 Chandler:Okay give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death one goal $1000.
 Chandler:Oh yes!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:No! No! No! No—(Joey looks at him)—one can beat me.
 Chandler:See? Now that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
 Chandler:Still broken?
 Chandler:Well there are other ways of winning back your money how about a little uh a little Blackjack? (Holds up a deck of cards.)
 Chandler:Okay uh how about how about—y’know what? We could play a new game. A new game it’s fun.
 Chandler:Cups.
 Chandler:I’ll teach ya! Come on come on it’s really easy and really really fun.
 Chandler:Okay here you go. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens what do you have?
 Chandler:Ho-ho you win! 50 dollars!
 Chandler:Oh yeah! Okay let’s play again. (He deals out two cards each again.) What do you got?
 Chandler:You’re kidding right?
 Chandler:Well that’s a full cup! (Pays him again.)
 Chandler:You win.
 Chandler:It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay now much have you won so far?
 Chandler:Not 700 exactly?
 Chandler:Double it! (He does.)
 Chandler:Well you see in Cups once you get $700 you have to double it.
 Chandler:Hey I didn’t make up the rules. Now after you receive the doubling bonus you get uh one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1500. (Joey gets excited.) Don’t get to excited because that’s not gonna happen unless you get—No way! (He takes the top card which is the two of clubs. Of course any card would’ve won. Chandler pays him.)
 Chandler:What’s wrong?
 Chandler:Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
 Chandler:Oh man!!
 Chandler:All right let’s play one more hand! One more!
 Chandler:I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!
 Chandler:No but wait—what if I bought it from you y’know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price say (Gets choked up) $1500?
 Chandler:When did I try to give you money?
 Chandler:I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you’re okay.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey.
 Chandler:I know. (He kisses her.)
 Chandler:No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
 Chandler:Sure!
 Chandler:I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
 Chandler:Exactly.
 Chandler:It’s not a real game! I made it up!
 Chandler:At a fake game!!
 Chandler:Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
 Chandler:Hmm let’s see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cards and shrugs.)
 Chandler:(not amused) And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
 Chandler:I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
 Chandler:Yes and while I'm doing that Ross has a great computer story for you.
 Chandler:So uh wh-where ya from?
 Chandler:Unbelievable
 Chandler:Hey look at all the boxes!
 Chandler:All right think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
 Chandler:Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
 Chandler:No-no
 Chandler:OK I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. (Turns around and sees that Joey isn't there.) Joe? (Hears giggling coming from a box) Well I guess Joey went home. Oh and look there's still one box that I have to unpack. (Hears the giggling again)
 Chandler:(pretending) Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
 Chandler:Yeah not bad right? You know what Monica’s gonna be working late so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
 Chandler:Yeah now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
 Chandler:What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
 Chandler:Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
 Chandler:Yes I'm gonna put it back (Mocking Ross) exactly where I found it.
 Chandler:She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
 Chandler:She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and appreciate it.
 Chandler:I see I see y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
 Chandler:No she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. (Picks up the phone and wipes it off) Phone's done ehh.
 Chandler:Hey Mon how's it going?
 Chandler:Oh come on come on it can't be that bad.
 Chandler:No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
 Chandler:It's all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! (To Ross) She's-she's gonna kill me.
 Chandler:We should start with the big stuff. Y’know? That'll be the easiest. Uh let's start with the couch. (He picks up one end and Ross doesn't help) I got it. (He moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)
 Chandler:What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the...(Tries to rest his feet on the coffee table but they won't reach) OK OK here's what we do we just uh move the couch closer to the coffee table.
 Chandler:OK well here we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
 Chandler:Yes but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
 Chandler:Oh no yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
 Chandler:Yeah Monica doesn't like that either Maybe I should stop doing that.
 Chandler:That's not specific to girls.
 Chandler:And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
 Chandler:Man I'm so lucky I have Monica.
 Chandler:Okay is this lamp in the same place?
 Chandler:(blocks the door) No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
 Chandler:(to Ross) I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
 Chandler:Look uh just come later we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
 Chandler:Bye! Thank God
 Chandler:Look we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
 Chandler:That's perfect! That's brilliant! (Starts going through the photo album)
 Chandler:Uh-huh
 Chandler:No I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. (Forced laughter)
 Chandler:Okay look don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you so I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it where it went back and I'm sorry I'm very sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry.
 Chandler:Do you want me to be afraid of you?
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
 Chandler:Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
 Chandler:Hi my name’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
 Chandler:So is Janine around?
 Chandler:Can I check out what she did to my room?
 Chandler:(The room is filled with flowers and a floral print sheet on the bed.) Oh my God. What is th… it’s like a guy never lived in here. Look you’ve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. (Looking around the living room.) It’s spreading already.
 Chandler:(Picking up a pillow.) Yeah is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
 Chandler:(Pointing to the table and picking up the box.) Is that your tiny little box that’s too small to put anything in?
 Chandler:No! Ok this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
 Chandler:Yes talk to her. Be a man.
 Chandler:Defend yourself.
 Chandler:Be right there sweetums. (Monica leaves. To Joey.) A totally different situation.
 Chandler:Hey how was your breakfast with Hillary?
 Chandler:Ohh yeah.
 Chandler:That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either.
 Chandler:Yeah let’s head off to work.
 Chandler:You know…Oh My God.
 Chandler:(Sarcastically) Really.
 Chandler:Yeah what was wrong with your old…human teeth.
 Chandler:No no no no. You’ll be fine. (turning to Monica) Hillary’s bind right?
 Chandler:Yeah. (Rachel walks in.)
 Chandler:What???
 Chandler:I am proud of all my friends today.
 Chandler:Hi I’m Chandler. Your live-in boy
 Chandler:Oh I am no women but that is one tasty dish. (Phoebe walks in.)
 Chandler:Yes God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s.
 Chandler:Yes but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
 Chandler:Nah Nah it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know do kind of like a man thing.
 Chandler:You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
 Chandler:No thanks Josephine.
 Chandler:Hey Ross I was wondering if… Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
 Chandler:Monica could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
 Chandler:What is the matter with you ?!?
 Chandler:You’re arranging flowers! (Pointing to the dish on the table.) You got dead flowers! You got a picture a picture of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
 Chandler:You’re turning into a women.
 Chandler:Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?
 Chandler:Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
 Chandler:Oh! That’s great they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!
 Chandler:(shocked at the news) Why can’t I tell them that we live together?
 Chandler:Why haven’t you told them?!
 Chandler:Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!
 Chandler:Why wouldn’t they be happy?
 Chandler:What? What? Why?!
 Chandler:Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?
 Chandler:Y’know it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they come over I will be all charming I will make them fall in love with me and then we’ll tell ‘em.
 Chandler:Hey I can be pretty charming babe I won YOU over didn’t I?
 Chandler:Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh good Ross! You’re parents like me right?
 Chandler:Well Monica just told me that they don’t.
 Chandler:(annoyed) Do you know why?
 Chandler:(angry) Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!
 Chandler:This is great another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
 Chandler:Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
 Chandler:[mocks that last comment].
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Mr. and Mrs. Geller you look wonderful it is great to have you hear let us take off your coats!
 Chandler:Whoa snowing out there?
 Chandler:Yeah Ross sure is a great guy y’know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
 Chandler:(worried) He’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
 Chandler:Oh yes. Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I don’t mean tight I mean it’s not too tight not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope he puts his head into his hands.]
 Chandler:(shocked) What?
 Chandler:You do? Why?
 Chandler:What?! Why did you do that?
 Chandler:How could it not matter?!
 Chandler:What about all that “friends forever” stuff?
 Chandler:Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
 Chandler:The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me okay? So will you fix this?
 Chandler:Yeah I’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
 Chandler:(clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah this is so good that I’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
 Chandler:(lying) Yes but if it’s any consolation before the bird dropped it he seemed to enjoy it.
 Chandler:Thank you!
 Chandler:(In a parent-like tone) I’ll talk to them!
 Chandler:Let me ask you why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
 Chandler:I dunno what it is it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to me.
 Chandler:See now it feels like Christmas!
 Chandler:Hey Joe what’s up?
 Chandler:I can see why that’s hard to resist.
 Chandler:You are aware that she’s not a monkey right?
 Chandler:Ah you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you? (He kisses her on the cheek)
 Chandler:What what are you laughing at?
 Chandler:I don’t think so.
 Chandler:(To Rachel) Oh my God!
 Chandler:I can save you time ladies I’m right here.
 Chandler:What? That’s terrible!
 Chandler:Oh well that makes it not terrible.
 Chandler:No not okay you can’t look for Monica’s presents!
 Chandler:No you don’t have to and you can’t because I live here too.
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:No I have a great idea for a present for her.
 Chandler:If I help we can find ‘em faster!
 Chandler:Y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look you don’t you don’t do that every year do you?
 Chandler:You don’t like go into the back of my closet and look under my gym bag or anything?
 Chandler:Because that’s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I’ve never seen before in my life! Okay that did not just happen! (He does a weird clicky motion with his fingers that kinda hard to describe.)
 Chandler:I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey oh hey!
 Chandler:Those are my gifts I got them for you.
 Chandler:Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
 Chandler:Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet okay?
 Chandler:Oh hey guys!
 Chandler:Yes if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
 Chandler:Oh the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Oh great!
 Chandler:Okay! Okay! Okay!
 Chandler:Wait we can’t do this.
 Chandler:I don’t wanna know what Monica got me. Y’know? I mean look I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present and wanting to surprise me and you guys are gonna ruin that and I look we have to put these back this is not what Christmas is about.
 Chandler:Nobody is opening anything ok? Look I don’t know about you guys but I wanna see the look on Monica’s face when I give her my present and I’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please please can we just can we put them back?
 Chandler:Fine!
 Chandler:That’s what you got me?
 Chandler:Now you do that you’re on TV.
 Chandler:That’s great!
 Chandler:So you kissed her so what happened after that?
 Chandler:So she’s just waiting over there for ya?
 Chandler:(entering) Oh hey Rachel sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff. (Hands her all of her bills and stuff.)
 Chandler:I’m not your garbage man. I’m your mailman.
 Chandler:A pharmacist. (Rachel mocks him.)
 Chandler:You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
 Chandler:You made pottery?
 Chandler:Ahh just like the apothecary tables of yore…
 Chandler:…so then the farmer says That’s not a cow and you’re not milking it. (Everyone laughs.)
 Chandler:Look at us we’re a couple of couples!
 Chandler:Yeah all right. (They part.) Okay good night guys.
 Chandler:And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (Hands it to him.) You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn’t afford it because you paid dinner last night.
 Chandler:Oh that’s too bad.
 Chandler:That’s funny I saw no phlegm.
 Chandler:Then why-why is she going to a play?!
 Chandler:Well why does she not want to hang out with us?!
 Chandler:So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
 Chandler:And I am not blah I am a hoot!
 Chandler:No you sh—No you said you made that up!!
 Chandler:Eh they’re both good. I generally just go with Monica’s drunk again. (Monica glares at him.)
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Okay one more time.
 Chandler:Perfect decibel.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh nothing we’re just talking. Y’know blah-blah-blah.
 Chandler:That’s totally understandable.
 Chandler:Oh yeah!
 Chandler:And I’m blah? Listen the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it (Imitating her) Oh Chandler I just lost myself in the moment.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Y’know I think you can take her.
 Chandler:Did you hear that?
 Chandler:Yeah I’m sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?
 Chandler:Hey so did uh did she move out?
 Chandler:You okay?
 Chandler:That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
 Chandler:I made that joke up.
 Chandler:Yes I did. I told it to Dan at work and he said it was the funniest joke he’d ever heard.
 Chandler:Monica you remember me telling you that joke right?
 Chandler:Seriously?
 Chandler:Yeah I guess.
 Chandler:(jumping up from his chair) Hey Joey Playboy printed my joke.
 Chandler:It’s my joke.
 Chandler:Dude you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time and I think they may break up.
 Chandler:Nah Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on I don’t want to miss when they were skinny.
 Chandler:What? No I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and the screen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?
 Chandler:Joey why is your cable out?
 Chandler:If you need money will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
 Chandler:Whoa ho.
 Chandler:(picks up the phone) All right you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
 Chandler:(with phone to ear obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phone bill?
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:So you heard it you repeated it so that must mean you wrote it.
 Chandler:And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.
 Chandler:(stops laughing to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
 Chandler:So you stole my joke and you stole my money.
 Chandler:Well she is going to know that you stole the joke.
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:Okay (he goes to sit down).
 Chandler:(visibly upset) He took my joke he took it.
 Chandler:You know who else picked Rachel? Ross and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:Picking Rachel.
 Chandler:Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
 Chandler:So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.
 Chandler:I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to make a lot of money and here’s your first tip Don’t eat yellow snow. (He laughs then picks up a pen glares at Ross and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha 215 coffeehouse.
 Chandler:It’s my joke.
 Chandler:Let’s have Monica decide.
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:Mon get out here!
 Chandler:Okay okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
 Chandler:Because you’re the only one that can be fair.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Don’t try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) I’m your only chance to have a baby. Okay let’s go.
 Chandler:Okay I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
 Chandler:Can I finish my story?!
 Chandler:So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’s doctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his point.)
 Chandler:I’m not arguing with that.
 Chandler:Is not.
 Chandler:Hi oh hi.
 Chandler:(starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and—(He falters and Monica prompts him.)—generosity of spirit.
 Chandler:(To Chandler) I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
 Chandler:(pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) You’re a little high maintenance.
 Chandler:I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going but you’re passionate and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So they can say that you’re high maintenance but it’s okay because I like … maintaining you.
 Chandler:(happily) I’m off the list. (Sits on the couch.)
 Chandler:Hey buddy boy how’d the audition go?
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. I’m not answering that.
 Chandler:This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
 Chandler:Hey what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work?
 Chandler:I’m so sorry you’re sick.
 Chandler:I’m gonna grab you some tissue.
 Chandler:Yes?
 Chandler:Oh my God introduce us!
 Chandler:Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! (Rachel glares at him.)
 Chandler:I know let’s rest and drink lots of fluids. (Holds up a glass of orange juice.)
 Chandler:That would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippy here. (Points to his nose.)
 Chandler:Yeah I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy.
 Chandler:Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just can’t have sex with a sick person.
 Chandler:That’s the thing see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
 Chandler:Oh what is it honey you need some tea? Some soup? (He gets up from the couch and goes into the bedroom to find Monica still in the robe lying seductively on the bed. Or at least she’s trying too and as he enters the room she takes the robe off on of her legs.) Oh-ohhhh!
 Chandler:Oh Jeez honey I thought I thought you were asleep.
 Chandler:I was asleep. (She takes off her robe and starts to shiver) Oh no! No-no honey! Y’know what’s sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
 Chandler:Would you please get some rest!
 Chandler:Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
 Chandler:No-no-no-no-no-no-no you are not getting me this way.
 Chandler:No-no-no-no-no!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:So you’re just kinda rubbing it on yourself?
 Chandler:It’s nice.
 Chandler:Yes! (Hangs his head in shame.)
 Chandler:It’s all very very good. (She covers up and sits down.) So you wanna go uh mix it up?
 Chandler:Oh come on you big faker!
 Chandler:Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
 Chandler:Okay! (Runs into the bedroom.)
 Chandler:(calling from the bathroom) What are you doing here?
 Chandler:We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
 Chandler:He’s taking off her coat!
 Chandler:Ho-oh he’s gonna get some! (Rachel looks at him.) Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y’know so umm he’s closed the drapes there so he can have a nice pleasant conversation with your little sister. (Pause) Well I’m off to bed! (Goes to bed.)
 Chandler:I’m good.
 Chandler:(looking) Is that a swing?
 Chandler:Yuck!
 Chandler:That was like 5 years ago.
 Chandler:Joey…
 Chandler:(totally not crying) Well see now that I can see crying over but Bambi is a cartoon!
 Chandler:Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
 Chandler:I’m not macho.
 Chandler:No I guess I just never really cried. Y’know? I’m not a crying kind of guy.
 Chandler:I’d be sad sure but I wouldn’t cry.
 Chandler:Cry?! I just found a talking puppy I’m rich!
 Chandler:Oh that’s Parent’s Day first grade. That’s me with the janitor Martin.
 Chandler:Oh they didn’t want to come!
 Chandler:No! Look I don’t cry! It’s not a big deal! Okay?!
 Chandler:You didn’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
 Chandler:Phoebe Buffay in Buffay The Vampire Layer.
 Chandler:Hey I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do porn.
 Chandler:Her ankle is what you’re watching?
 Chandler:She’s just doing her job!
 Chandler:Hey! (He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the couch only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)
 Chandler:There’s no back to this couch!
 Chandler:Yeah I know but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know all dead inside.
 Chandler:Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
 Chandler:No I mean come on seriously think about it we get married we’re up at the altar and I’m like this. (Makes a bored face.)
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:Okay well I won’t uh worry about this anymore then.
 Chandler:Aww I love you so…
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:So you didn’t mean any of that?!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Maybe we should give them some privacy.
 Chandler:(crying hysterically) I just don’t see why those two can’t work things out!
 Chandler:(starts crying) I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone. (They all look at him.) I can’t help it I opened a gate.
 Chandler:Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
 Chandler:Sure I would!
 Chandler:What you guys really think that I’m that shallow?
 Chandler:What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker getting paid to be funny. But my job’s fun too! I mean tomorrow I-I don’t have to wear a tie.
 Chandler:(entering depressed) Hey.
 Chandler:Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny just not Archie Comic funny.
 Chandler:Was his question what’s more boring than him?
 Chandler:Hey I may have no money but I still have my pride.
 Chandler:Ehh.
 Chandler:I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:All right!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Well it’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he’s not real.
 Chandler:Uh-oh it’s my boss!
 Chandler:(reading the list) Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
 Chandler:Phoebe are you having a heart attack?!
 Chandler:I always thought having a heart attack was nature’s way of telling you to die! (Phoebe glares at him.) But you’re not gonna die. I mean you are going to die but you’re not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
 Chandler:Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is Bring me food. Two is I’m with a girl bring us food. Three is I’m lost and I can’t find food.
 Chandler:(approaching) Here you go Joe here’s the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. (Hands it to him.)
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:I’m sorry I guess I just like the pulp.
 Chandler:Okay anything for you sir?
 Chandler:It’s not all juice! (Rachel quickly gets out of the way.)
 Chandler:Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
 Chandler:Aww.
 Chandler:You wanna share it?
 Chandler:What’s this?
 Chandler:Aww thanks man. (They hug.)
 Chandler:Oh you wouldn’t uh care. It’s just a stupid comic book story.
 Chandler:Well uh Archie needs money to fix his jalopy (Joey laughs) uh but he doesn’t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist—as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can’t have lumps in them.
 Chandler:No the doctors say it may kill her.
 Chandler:(To Ross) But I think we should tell her.
 Chandler:Listen Phoebe he’s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
 Chandler:Uh what about y’know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
 Chandler:I’m sorry you’re here with me instead of Roger.
 Chandler:Well I could make it seem like he’s here. (Imitates him.) Here’s some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn’t add the second cous until 1979. (Mumbles something further.)
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:What was tonight?
 Chandler:Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?
 Chandler:With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monica shrugs.) Oh my God!
 Chandler:Four different women! I’ve had sex way more times!
 Chandler:Nine.
 Chandler:Well good good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
 Chandler:Hey that’s what I tell girls about me.
 Chandler:No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
 Chandler:Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)
 Chandler:So was I.
 Chandler:We can’t do this.
 Chandler:Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me y’know? Because you’ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldn’t want to disappoint you.
 Chandler:I do like that.
 Chandler:Well if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight right?
 Chandler:Stop it! We’re doing this! Let’s do it!
 Chandler:Okay! (They both get up.)
 Chandler:I have some moves.
 Chandler:Yeah let’s just forget it.
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Oh yeah.
 Chandler:(sexily) Yeah?
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Oh okay! (He rolls over to do that again.)
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
 Chandler:So you uh want to do something tonight?
 Chandler:Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you’re still seeing him and uh he’s a good guy. I mean I remember a time when… (He fakes falling asleep.)
 Chandler:Yeah! Totally! Totally and you?
 Chandler:I bet he can.
 Chandler:Oh yeah! Yeah! Don’t worry about me I’ll be fine! (Does a kara-tay move.)
 Chandler:(sticking his head in the door) Okay to come in?
 Chandler:Yeah I know guess who beeped him?
 Chandler:I’m the ruptured spleen. (Laughs.)
 Chandler:Because you shouldn’t be with him. (Pause.) You should be with me.
 Chandler:Yeah! When you were talking about Roger that was killing me! Look things like last night they don’t just happen. Y’know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women in the morning y’know I was just lying there and I couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends but with you I always y’know with a friend.
 Chandler:I know you probably don’t want to go out with me y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a doctor…
 Chandler:No there were two.
 Chandler:Oh yeah.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
 Chandler:I see where you’re goin’!
 Chandler:(reminiscing) Ah finally an explanation.
 Chandler:Hey-hey is Monica here?
 Chandler:Okay look I need your help I don’t know what to get her for Valentine’s Day.
 Chandler:(laughs) She was working on Valentine’s Day so we’re celebrating it tonight.
 Chandler:Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and her brother (the camera pans to Ross flashing Joey a very evil look; Joey gets scared) I can’t do that we promised we’d make each other gifts this year.
 Chandler:Yeah I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
 Chandler:I made a… (Does one of those gibberish words.)
 Chandler:Nothing!
 Chandler:Well have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
 Chandler:(admiring his work) This this actually is a… (Does the same gibberish word from before.)
 Chandler:Hey! Honey can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Day gifts?
 Chandler:Do we have to make the entire thing?
 Chandler:Of course of course not. I just have to uh go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
 Chandler:(sticking his head back in) What?
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:Okay are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?
 Chandler:I can’t figure out what to make Monica.
 Chandler:I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
 Chandler:Yeah I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
 Chandler:Wait a minute I can’t give this to her.
 Chandler:Because it says Captain Ross on the side and I hate Monica on the bottom.
 Chandler:Okay. Okay. (He goes to the closet moves the clothes out of the way and notices an empty hanger. He takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. Then he holds it out as if he’s giving it to her.) Yes honey I made it myself. (He throws it down and goes to her chest grabs something goes to the bed table and takes out a pair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he just removed.) I can’t do it. I can’t do it. (He throws them both down and continues looking. He opens another closet door and finds a tape.) Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!! (He runs out into the living room.)
 Chandler:Hey! Hi! You uh ready to exchange gifts?
 Chandler:Okay come here! Come here.
 Chandler:Now it’s not wrapped because I just just finished it.
 Chandler:But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
 Chandler:(momentarily terrified) Maybe we’ll have to listen and see!
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:It’s a sock bunny.
 Chandler:Not really.
 Chandler:I see. Y’know umm Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
 Chandler:Oh it’s okay. I don’t…
 Chandler:(thinking it over) Well I did put a lot of thought in the tape. (They both run into the bedroom.)
 Chandler:Wow! (To the sock bunny still on his hand.) You are way to young to have seen that!
 Chandler:You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
 Chandler:Yeah! (Takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.)
 Chandler:You have done enough!
 Chandler:No you don’t—get it in black not brown.
 Chandler:Oop!
 Chandler:Well it’s like that old saying have some sex eat some cake.
 Chandler:Who the hell is Carl?!
 Chandler:Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you aren’t they?
 Chandler:Oh my good God.
 Chandler:Look you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
 Chandler:Oh the mixed tape.
 Chandler:No! You’re the sweetest! (He tries to kiss her but Monica backs away with a look that could kill on her face.)
 Chandler:I am so so so so sorry!
 Chandler:And I will cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen) and do anything in there! (Points to the bedroom.)
 Chandler:Come on Monica it’s our Valentine’s Day. Please? Please-please please?
 Chandler:Okay. (They hug.)
 Chandler:So are we going in there?
 Chandler:Ahh Hotties of the Paleontology Department there’s a big selling calendar eh?
 Chandler:A hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s Rain Man.
 Chandler:Oh is that against the rules?
 Chandler:I see.
 Chandler:Oh yeah Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
 Chandler:Oh I don’t know man. I haven’t talked to her in like ten years.
 Chandler:You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand four hundred…
 Chandler:Oh okay I’ll-I’ll try.
 Chandler:Yeah so Tuesday?
 Chandler:(sarcastically) Thank you.
 Chandler:You just thought of that in there?
 Chandler:What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
 Chandler:How’s your room Rach?
 Chandler:Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
 Chandler:God it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how long it’s been!
 Chandler:(on phone) Oh that’s great! Good for you.
 Chandler:Okay! So yeah maybe we can get together umm… (Joey mimes throwing something in the air catching it rolling it out putting it in an oven and cutting it.) Can you hold for one second please? (To Joey) What?!
 Chandler:(on phone) Hi! I’m back. (Goes to hang up the phone.) Yeah that sounds great. (Listens) Okay. Well we’ll do it then. (Listens) Okay bye-bye. (He hangs up the phone and turns around to see Joey standing close to him and screams.)
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:(To Joey) We didn’t get to the audition. I’m gonna take her to coffee and then we’ll do it then.
 Chandler:Honey it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years! You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules y’know? You gotta you got to put in some time.
 Chandler:No we only went out once.
 Chandler:Not once!
 Chandler:(laughs) Oh that’s great my friend Joey’s in the movie business.
 Chandler:(giggles) My friend’s name is Joey.
 Chandler:Yeah I’ve always hated that Howie.
 Chandler:The nerve huh?
 Chandler:Refill?
 Chandler:(entering) Hey.
 Chandler:I couldn’t do it.
 Chandler:Hey relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight.
 Chandler:Uh Dana Keystone from college.
 Chandler:No that was Dana Caplin.
 Chandler:Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no that’s not—No-no-no!
 Chandler:No-no—Really?!
 Chandler:(breaking up) Well it just hurts so bad. I uh…
 Chandler:Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
 Chandler:Well I umm I mean this is just off the top of my head now umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
 Chandler:Well the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later. (He runs off and leaves her with the bill which the waiter promptly delivers.)
 Chandler:(entering sees Rachel’s throw) Ni-hi-ice!
 Chandler:(To Joey) So you busy Thursday?
 Chandler:Okay. Okay. (Joey puts him down.) What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:No! No! No! I was so careful! (Runs out.)
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:So?!
 Chandler:It’s Thursday! How was the audition?!
 Chandler:Well of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. (Pats Joey’s arm Joey pats Chandler’s shoulder and Chandler motions for Joey to say the same about him.)
 Chandler:So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
 Chandler:(laughs) Isn’t she cute? (On Monica’s death stare) No!
 Chandler:So why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
 Chandler:Oh tell her good luck with that.
 Chandler:Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
 Chandler:Oh that’s so funny because we found someone too.
 Chandler:Why would our guy be a weirdo?
 Chandler:A face ass?
 Chandler:No our guy is just a floating head.
 Chandler:(horrified) Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
 Chandler:Our guy has great hair.
 Chandler:Our guy smells incredible.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Well you…don’t look good Joe.
 Chandler:That’s still in there?!
 Chandler:Is this a service you’re providing me?
 Chandler:Our new fridge? I don’t live here anymore.
 Chandler:Uh-huh.
 Chandler:(not quite sure where Joey’s going and is a little worried) Okay…
 Chandler:Just tell her the truth! Tell her you’re not ready.
 Chandler:Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
 Chandler:Joey I saw you push him!
 Chandler:Uh-huh.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Wait a minute is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? (Does a little whooping/party noise.)
 Chandler:I can see it now Look dad it’s the Sphinx! (Does that party noise again.)
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
 Chandler:Are you funny?
 Chandler:(To Monica) Turns out he is kinda funny.
 Chandler:Yeah but Sebastian? What is that? A cat’s name?
 Chandler:Okay so you will meet our guys?
 Chandler:Okay now it doesn’t matter which one you choose y’know? It’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
 Chandler:(To Ross) Well there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
 Chandler:You know the hotels?
 Chandler:Well maybe you don’t marry this one.
 Chandler:Good-good-good-good.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good but uh y’know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (Laughs) Eldad come here! (He stands up from the next table.)
 Chandler:Eldad sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now!
 Chandler:There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler)
 Chandler:Hi. (To Phoebe) Okay you’re too late okay? Because she’s already with our guy.
 Chandler:It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.)
 Chandler:(To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To Eldad) You dance for Rachel!
 Chandler:So what was it for anyway?
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:(To Joey) So uh what’s this thing you’re auditioning for?
 Chandler:That is lucky.
 Chandler:Now-now why would you say that Joseph?
 Chandler: Whoa she's pretty. (Mentioning the girl on TV)
 Chandler: Oh ok.
 Chandler:Oh no it's terrific it's- it's- y'know you deserve this after all your years of struggling you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.
 Chandler:Oh are we playing this?!
 Chandler:Hey! How’d the audition go?
 Chandler:So it did go well.
 Chandler:Oh that’s great!
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Oh-oh what are you doing?
 Chandler:Well it is overdue.
 Chandler:(on phone) Yes Fran. I know what time it is but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
 Chandler:Oh come on guys it’s not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren’t for (struggles to get this out) Monica’s allergies. (The duck quacks.) You’re right I could never lie to you. She hates you. (The phone rings.) Should I get that? (Laughs then answers the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Uh no Joey’s not here right now. Can I take a message? (Listens) Yeah okay so the audition has been moved from 500 to 230? (Listens) Okay great. (Listens.) Bye. (Hangs up the phone and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle on the door but Monica walks in and forces him to jump out of the way.)
 Chandler:(looks down at his clothes) Am I naked again?!
 Chandler:Yeah okay I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean is it okay if they come visit?
 Chandler:Oh right your allergies. (Monica leaves and to the chick and duck) All her she hates you. (Chandler leaves without finishing the message for Joey.)
 Chandler:As crazy as soccer?
 Chandler:You mean you didn’t get it from this?
 Chandler:Well maybe we can fix it y’know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
 Chandler:I messed up. Okay? I’m sorry I really messed up.
 Chandler:Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look if there was anything I could do I would do it. Okay? But everybody’s allowed one mistake right?
 Chandler: You know he coulda gotten me a VCR he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs but no he has to get me the woman repeller!  The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
 Chandler: Oh yeah easy for you to say you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]
 Chandler: I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry I do I do. I pity the fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi!
 Chandler: Yeah I mean when you were late last night Kathy and I got to talking and one thing to another and…
 Chandler: No! No! No! I just kissed her.
 Chandler: How is that worse?!
 Chandler: You’re right I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
 Chandler:Look I’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you’re not perfect! You’ve made some errors in judgment too!
 Chandler:(lets him out) What happened?!!
 Chandler: What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
 Chandler: So--You got in voluntarily?!
 Chandler: BEND OVER?!!!
 Chandler:Ok now remember no trading. You get the pretty one I get the mess.
 Chandler:...And what did you bring?
 Chandler:Janice?
 Chandler:Janice?!
 Chandler:Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
 Chandler:Oh come on!  He said he was going to do my inseam and he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite...
 Chandler:Cupping.
 Chandler:I can’t believe I did this! What an idiot!
 Chandler:Do you think he’ll ever forgive me?
 Chandler:Y’know what? I-I kinda have.
 Chandler:You didn’t see how mad he was y’know?
 Chandler:(coming out from behind the door) I KNEW IT!!!!
 Chandler:Oh my God! 
 Chandler:Joey? Got you a Joey Special two pizzas! Joe? (The phone rings and he answers it) (On phone) Hello? (Takes the phone away from his mouth when he realizes what he just did and yells.) Damnit! (Back on phone.) Hello? (Listens.) No Joey’s not here right now but I can take a message I think. (Listens) He’s still got a chance for the part?! Oh that’s great news! (Listens) Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. (Listens) Oh well that’s great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! (Hangs up and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle.) Yes! (Reading what he’s writing) Okay Mac audition at 200. Allergy actor attacked. (Pause) By dog not flowers.
 Chandler:Please tell me you got the message!
 Chandler:The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it they needed to see you at 2 o’clock.
 Chandler:Du-du-I wrote it I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross’s! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
 Chandler:Sorry! I-I-I don’t know what to say.
 Chandler:(angrily) Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
 Chandler:Y’know sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
 Chandler:Well that’s good. Because you didn’t! And I’m incredibly happy for ya!!
 Chandler:Oh we could do this all day.
 Chandler:You are gonna be a huge star! I’m gonna hug ya!
 Chandler:All right!
 Chandler:I think so. Yeah get off me.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Oh well thank you in advance. (Kisses her.)
 Chandler:Hey!!
 Chandler:Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
 Chandler:Are you judging them by their covers? Because you’re really not supposed to do that.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Wait a minute hold the phone! You’re not Elizabeth’s dad?!
 Chandler:Ross!
 Chandler:There’s a Mr. Bing!
 Chandler:But uh Ross Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh funny story… (He starts laughing then notices that Paul isn’t happy.) You’re roommate in college died didn’t he?
 Chandler:Yes we were just…
 Chandler:Hey honey you got the kind with the little girl you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
 Chandler:No the little girl creeps me out.
 Chandler:Why would the baby creep me out?
 Chandler:This is going in your book?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Damn those robots they’re supposed to be our faithful servants!
 Chandler:So do you think uh Joey’s more charming than me?
 Chandler:Yeah you wish. (Stops to think about it and gets depressed.)
 Chandler:Who?
 Chandler:Hmm.
 Chandler:Oh.
 Chandler:Oh-oh.
 Chandler:We said seven!
 Chandler:The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s let meet at seven not at six.
 Chandler:Oh my good God.
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:(disgusted) What does it say?!
 Chandler:Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh great book and you are the queen of everything.
 Chandler:(To Monica) I told you I should not wear this color. (He’s wearing a reddish-orange sweater.)
 Chandler:So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
 Chandler:Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
 Chandler:Hi how are ya?
 Chandler:(whispering in Joey’s ear) The reason he just said.
 Chandler:Yeah I’ve been there my friend.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:I’ll give up my ticket.
 Chandler:And I think Ross is generous too.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Ross.
 Chandler:(on machine) You’ve reached Monica and Chandler’s if you’re listening to this message we’re probably screening. (to himself) Yeah we are.
 Chandler:(on phone) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (Listens) Yes the groom—No! Not the groom!!
 Chandler:(gets up) See you later. (Starts to leave.)
 Chandler:(angrily) Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! (He storms out.)
 Chandler:(on machine) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (The machine beeps off.)
 Chandler:I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married but that happens everyday. (Does one of those Chandler noises.)
 Chandler:Right here! (Clucks like a chicken for some reason.)
 Chandler:Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you Phoebe and Rachel Heldi and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Yes if it really doesn’t mean anything because you know that I’m just not ready…
 Chandler:Okay. (They hug.)
 Chandler:Totally.
 Chandler:Yeah it’s beautiful.
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:Pheebs can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page) Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah! Paper cut!
 Chandler:No I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.
 Chandler:Well it’s because I trust you you’re one of my best friends and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
 Chandler:Me too.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh all right.
 Chandler:Oh well we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place.
 Chandler:Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too and I can’t find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and starts pointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Notices that one of the jewelers is watching him.) It’s a beautiful selection. (The jeweler walks away slowly.)
 Chandler:Y’know I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.
 Chandler:Yeah I’m gonna stick with the ring. (Goes to another display counter.) Oh this one’s nice! (Pointing to another ring.) I like this one! Sir? Uh kind sir? Can I see this one?
 Chandler:Uh-uh yes. I would like to see that ring please.
 Chandler:Sir can I ask you to umm could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
 Chandler:(choking up) Oh my God that’s it that’s the ring! How much is it?
 Chandler:Yes! Yes but I can only pay $8000.
 Chandler:Uh credit card. (Reaches for it then realizes) Oh no! No-no but I left my credit card with Joey. (To Phoebe) Okay I’ll go get it. You guard the ring.
 Chandler:No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.)
 Chandler:No did he hug you?!
 Chandler:Well you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:I’m a little busy here Paul.
 Chandler:Okay a quick one. Come on hug it out. (Paul rushes over and hugs Chandler tightly.) Oh hey! There you go. (The hug continues.) Okay. (The hug continues.)
 Chandler:Okay! (Pushes him away.)
 Chandler:Do you have my credit card?
 Chandler:Thank God! (Grabs his card.)
 Chandler:Oh I can’t go.
 Chandler:Oh that’s uh that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with the one I picked first.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:They put you in jail?
 Chandler:Phoebe I asked you to guard the ring!
 Chandler:Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
 Chandler:It was the ring!
 Chandler:I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
 Chandler:No it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica’s face when I gave it to her y’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look this is the most important thing I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect.
 Chandler:I can’t do that.
 Chandler:Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
 Chandler:Yeah! Okay go go go get him.
 Chandler:(to him) Hi! Hi. Okay there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So I’m gonna need to have that back. (The guy isn’t sure.) But in exchange I’m willing to trade you this beautiful more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.) Ew.
 Chandler:No-no! This is my fiancee (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring. You don’t want to break her heart now do you?
 Chandler:Yeah she’s dying… Of a cough apparently.
 Chandler:(interrupting her) Okay that’s enough honey!
 Chandler:Great! Okay here. (Holds the ring up for him.)
 Chandler:Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And you are about to marry a wonderful man! (She stunned and he’s horrified.) Hey! I’m marrying a dead woman!
 Chandler:Guys? (They ignore him.) I’ve got something important to tell ya. (Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to try and watch the TV Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.
 Chandler:Yeah check out the ring. (Shows it to them.)
 Chandler:Yep pretty much.
 Chandler:(goes to hug him and stops short) Heyyyy—What?
 Chandler:Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait ‘til uh it was official y’know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you’re my best friends.
 Chandler:I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:Check out the ring.
 Chandler:Well she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that right? (Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the game on TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)
 Chandler:Okay well tonight’s the big night.
 Chandler:It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full instead of proposing a toast I’m just gonna propose.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:I’m not gonna mess it up.
 Chandler:She’s not gonna say no.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:(To Phoebe) Give me it!
 Chandler:Phoebe!
 Chandler:(with his mouthful) Hi Monica.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:(glaring at her) Well Monica and Chandler can’t go. We’re going to dinner remember?!
 Chandler:I just get mad when Rachel doesn’t remember where we’re going.
 Chandler:Well you could also give back the money you owe me.
 Chandler:Oh so you’re already doing your part for the kids.
 Chandler:Wait a minute all jokes aside? I didn’t agree to that!
 Chandler:Will you marry me? Will you marry me? (Makes like a gun with his fingers.) Hey you marry me! (He gives up as Joey Rachel Phoebe and Ross slink in all excited.) What’s going on little elves?
 Chandler:Yeah right here in my pocket. (Pats his pocket. Phoebe smiles goes over to hug him and removes the ring from his pocket.) Pheebs?
 Chandler:Okay now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she’s gonna know.
 Chandler:(To Monica) You are beautiful.
 Chandler:(trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (It’s a butchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreign friends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.)
 Chandler:Yes! Yes! I’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!
 Chandler:Oh yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh no you can’t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold you should’ve brought your own jacket. But uh other than that are you okay? Are you okay?
 Chandler:Yes! I’m fine. In fact I’ve been fine for a long time now and I think the reason is you.
 Chandler:Okay umm before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn’t imagine growing old with…
 Chandler:(not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know but just let me say it.
 Chandler:What?! I’m Chandler! (She nods towards the doorway Chandler turns and looks) Oh that’s Richard!
 Chandler:Hey-hey hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I don’t know why I did that!
 Chandler:(to Richard’s date) And uh you don’t have a mustache which is good. (She just smiles.) I’m Chandler; I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable.
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles at him.) See I did it again.
 Chandler:Yeah I’ll sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)
 Chandler:Yes. (Thinking he’s gone.)
 Chandler:I got a good one I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:(stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
 Chandler:Richard!
 Chandler:Oh you knew that. Good!
 Chandler:For camp!
 Chandler:Hey you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you’re not careful you may not get married at all this year!
 Chandler:(after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!
 Chandler:Richard was there so I couldn’t do it!
 Chandler:I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know and-and surprise her but now you’ve ruined it!
 Chandler:Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!
 Chandler:This is terrible. What am I going to do?
 Chandler:That’s right I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
 Chandler:I can do that I’ve had 30 years of practice.
 Chandler:Okay okay here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Oh just hanging out talkin’ about uh websites. (Joey laughs.) Yeah we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
 Chandler:Yeah well… Y’know it just got me thinking though why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
 Chandler:Eh…
 Chandler:Sure I do. In fact I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!
 Chandler:If marriage worked I’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
 Chandler:Well never say never but y’know probably uh yeah never.
 Chandler:Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!
 Chandler:(to them) It’s okay I got a plan.
 Chandler:I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:My—Oh my God!
 Chandler:He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’m supposed to do that!
 Chandler:Well what… Y’know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna go over there; I’m gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!
 Chandler:You’re right.
 Chandler:Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) I’m gonna get the ring! I’m gonna get the ring! (Does so) I’m gonna go find her and (starts running for the door) I’m just going to propose!
 Chandler:Okay great.
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:Where is she? I’m not scared of you! (Averts his eyes and walks in.)
 Chandler:(examining the coffee table) Scotch on the rocks with a twist on a coaster? Ha-ha Monica! Monica!
 Chandler:Well where did she go?
 Chandler:Oh my God I can’t believe this! Y’know I thought…I thought you were a good guy.
 Chandler:Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?
 Chandler:Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
 Chandler:And what does she have to think about? I love her!
 Chandler:But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things she’d be surprised!
 Chandler:It was working until you showed up you big tree! I mean this isn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! (Sits down heavily.) I was gonna propose tonight.
 Chandler:Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Did you get a ring?
 Chandler:Y’know Richard…you are a good guy.
 Chandler:I can’t talk to you now I gotta find Monica!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:What are you talking about?
 Chandler:Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her it was a plan?!
 Chandler:Well where… Where did she go?
 Chandler:I can’t believe I ruined this.
 Chandler:Oh my God.
 Chandler:Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! Oh God I thought… (Starting to cry pauses) Wait a minute I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you’ll let me I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica will you marry me?
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Monica and I are engaged.
 Chandler:Thanks.
 Chandler:(To Ross) Okay you get her in here. (To Joey) You bolt the door. I’ll be in the closet.
 Chandler:It’s okay I want this to be your night too. (Raises his class.) To Monica.
 Chandler:To Monica!
 Chandler:So when you said Get up early did you mean 1986?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Know what I mean?
 Chandler:There’s gonna be a wedding. You’re gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
 Chandler:(motioning with his hands) I’m not worried I’m uh I’m fascinated. Y’know it’s like uh Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her room with her guitar.)
 Chandler:Sure you guys don’t have this problem you’re made of wood. (Rachel comes out of the bathroom) Hey!
 Chandler:You look great!
 Chandler:You okay over there?
 Chandler:Oh don’t worry about it I mean you probably were tired you had a lot of champagne it happens to everybody.
 Chandler:(putting his hands up) Take whatever you want just please don’t hurt me.
 Chandler:Yes on a scale from 1 to 10 10 being the dumbest a person can look you are definitely 19.
 Chandler:Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody’s ready and please oh please keep my underwear!
 Chandler:Joe?
 Chandler:Uhh you’ve had a lot of sex right?
 Chandler:Well it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kind of eh uh I was unable to—I mean I really wanted too but I couldn’t…. There huh—hmm there-there was an incident.
 Chandler:It’s happened to you?
 Chandler:Well what’d you do?
 Chandler:(angrily) I don’t think that’s what they were talking about Joe!!
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:Yes you can pass for 19.
 Chandler:Yes!
 Chandler:Seriously? Seriously no! You can play your own age which is 31!
 Chandler:Now Monica I know you’re upset but don’t forget. There is going to be a wedding you are going to throw the bouquet and then there’s going to be a honeymoon maybe in Paris.
 Chandler:We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).
 Chandler:Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it’s romantic but because I can!
 Chandler:Okay don’t say anything you might scare it away.
 Chandler:It’s Paris who knows we’re here!
 Chandler:Pheebs we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
 Chandler:Oh give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!
 Chandler:What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay bye-bye!
 Chandler:(entering) Ahh third base.
 Chandler:(To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.
 Chandler:Well somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)
 Chandler:How is that ever going to happen?!
 Chandler:(To Ross) I don’t care she slept with me.
 Chandler:Thanks.
 Chandler:(interrupting her just in time) Hey! Here’s a dollar consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
 Chandler:Okay. (Goes back to bed.)
 Chandler:What’s the matter honey?
 Chandler:(incredulous) Already?!
 Chandler:Oh I got some thoughts on that.
 Chandler:What in God’s name is that?!
 Chandler:Well you couldn’t get them anyway. Ian doesn’t plan anymore and Derrick… (Off of Rachel and Monica’s looks) And Derrick is a name I shouldn’t know.
 Chandler:Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
 Chandler:Now do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Centerpieces!
 Chandler:Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well I just think they’re a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.) But Lilies are the clear choice.
 Chandler:Uh-huh!
 Chandler:Oh yeah I should probably call them.
 Chandler:Oh I don’t think I ever heard that story.
 Chandler:What a sweet story.
 Chandler:Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. (Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)
 Chandler:I don’t know my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to (Pause) Dollywood.
 Chandler:Honey it’s gonna be okay.
 Chandler:Look it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we’re gonna get married.
 Chandler:Well I have some.
 Chandler:Well close to… (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to write it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.)
 Chandler:Well you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
 Chandler:Well come on I’ve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future not just for a party.
 Chandler:No I realize that honey but I’m not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
 Chandler:Look I understand but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
 Chandler:Yes I am!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Ehh.
 Chandler:Look I thought about it too and I’m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
 Chandler:Yeah I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then then that’s what we’re gonna do.
 Chandler:Eh forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Uh four a boy twin girls and another boy.
 Chandler:Well stuff like where’d we live y’know? Like a small place outside the city where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course we’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
 Chandler:Sure you do.
 Chandler:You sure?
 Chandler:I love you so much.
 Chandler:Oh yeah totally!
 Chandler:Hey you guys!
 Chandler:So what do you think?
 Chandler:Are you kidding? Okay I’ll give you a hint; I’ll give you a hint. (Points to his glasses.)
 Chandler:I got glasses!
 Chandler:No I didn’t!
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:(sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didn’t think I used to wear glasses right?
 Chandler:That’s okay Pheebs we’re not having a party or anything so you don’t have to get us…
 Chandler:What we want honey.
 Chandler:Dying people say the craziest things.
 Chandler:Our kids are gonna be fat aren’t they.
 Chandler:Hey! How’s the boat?!
 Chandler:Well it’s good that you finally have a place to do that.
 Chandler:Do you know what I was thinkin’?
 Chandler:Nothing I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)
 Chandler:Uh why do you have a lecture?
 Chandler:Then free as a bird. What’s up?
 Chandler:Well did-did you correct him?
 Chandler:Oh no problem maybe I’ll play with my left hand.
 Chandler:Does anybody know me?!
 Chandler:Don’t worry about it Pheebs.
 Chandler:An old cookie?
 Chandler:We can’t accept this.
 Chandler:‘Cause it’s gross.
 Chandler:Okay we owe you a present.
 Chandler:I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
 Chandler:Daddy. All right look here’s the story. (Flashback to Chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way around the steam filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses and that’s when in happened.
 Chandler:Guys?
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:Why do they put so much steam in there?!
 Chandler:Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
 Chandler:Not that big a deal? There…there was touching of things.
 Chandler:I don’t want him to tell this story for years.
 Chandler:If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
 Chandler:(getting up) All right I’m off to see your dad.
 Chandler:Look I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore and I figure the best way to do that is face to face—And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face I don’t mean my ass. (Exits.)
 Chandler:So you understand I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know I’m a little…I’m a little embarrassed about it.
 Chandler:What did you do when they found out?
 Chandler:So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
 Chandler:It’s your mommy. It’s your mommy.
 Chandler:That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
 Chandler:And say nothing?
 Chandler:No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)
 Chandler:Hi sweetie. So what was with all the whispering?
 Chandler:Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
 Chandler:No I’m serious we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
 Chandler:Oh no-no I can’t do that.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:So Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant I mean a guy a hibachi and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway we’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
 Chandler:No he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs hysterically.) So what was Phoebe’s secret?
 Chandler:That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
 Chandler:(angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
 Chandler:What about him?
 Chandler:Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow! Don’t show this to Monica! And don’t tell her about the W-H-Wow!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh it’s always nicer to here than Aw crap! You again!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh yeah?
 Chandler:Did you not understand the story?
 Chandler:Hey! What’s up?
 Chandler:Huh.
 Chandler:No! (The oven dings.) Shhh!
 Chandler:Nancy Thompson’s getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the shoulder.)
 Chandler:I had too okay?! We’re getting married! Married couples can’t keep secrets from one another!
 Chandler:Du-ude!
 Chandler:Did you not hear me say Du-ude?!
 Chandler:In my defense it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
 Chandler:Ho-ho so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
 Chandler:You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college Ross used to wear leg warmers!
 Chandler:Ross came in forth and cried!
 Chandler:(To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross) Wow—whoa!
 Chandler:Hey!!!
 Chandler:That was you!
 Chandler:(To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right?
 Chandler:Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.)
 Chandler:Y’know when I said that because we’re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
 Chandler:Yeah that was stupid. Let’s not do that.
 Chandler:Yeah and not that you would but I wouldn’t hang out with…all the guys in my office.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
 Chandler:What are you guys doing?
 Chandler:Oooh I’m afraid that does not exist.
 Chandler:No there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this… (Makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. Henceforth this shall be known as The Face.)
 Chandler:I don’t know what it is I just can’t take a good picture.
 Chandler:Yeah I’m not in that.
 Chandler:All right but I should warn you I’m not going. I’m going. (Does The Face while saying that last part.)
 Chandler:How about those three pointers?
 Chandler:And those guys were this (Doing the standard This Close gesture) close to lettin’ us play this time too.
 Chandler:Yes and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
 Chandler:They have that on the napkins at the club.
 Chandler:Rach if you have a crush on this guy why would you hire him? I mean y’know you can’t date him right?
 Chandler:Dude that is so sad.
 Chandler:Could I play?
 Chandler:Okay. (Does The Face.)
 Chandler:No I am.
 Chandler:I do? (He smiles beautifully.)
 Chandler:Okay. (You’ll have to see it I can’t describe the face he makes but it isn’t good.)
 Chandler:Aww! (Smiles.)
 Chandler:Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
 Chandler:I can’t help it!
 Chandler:Borrow money from me?
 Chandler:Why is there jelly on your shoe?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:(Pause) I’m right here!
 Chandler:I’m still right here!
 Chandler:Did you have a crush on me when you first met me?
 Chandler:Can you people not see me?! (He waves his arms around to get their attention.)
 Chandler:There I am!
 Chandler:Yeah Joey said I uh I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
 Chandler:Yeah and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
 Chandler:I don’t know but don’t worry don’t worry because I know how to take a picture now. (They get ready) Okay see? Look down (Looks down) look down look down… (He falls asleep.)
 Chandler:(awakens) Yeah! (Looks up and does The Face.)
 Chandler:Ahhh.
 Chandler:Oh yeah that looks good.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:I’m marrying her.
 Chandler:Die Hard still great!
 Chandler:What’d you rent?
 Chandler:(looking at the tape) Joey this is Die Hard 1 again.
 Chandler:Yeah I just got uh got plans.
 Chandler:No see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
 Chandler:That’s sweet.
 Chandler:So uh what did this woman look like?
 Chandler:Well is there any chance you were looking into a bright shiny thing called a mirror?
 Chandler:No no I only dated two girls in college both blonde both not attractive… (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
 Chandler:Well let’s see… (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh is that her? (Pointing to the picture.)
 Chandler:Julie Grath my camp girlfriend.
 Chandler:(pause) No we’re still together. Yeah we went out for two summers and then I broke up with her.
 Chandler:Well ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…
 Chandler:I did not say fat! I said Fa-aa-aw-ow…
 Chandler:Yeah. Yeah but it was a really really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
 Chandler:Well you know what they say elephants never forget. (Monica is not amused by that statement.) Seriously good luck marrying me.
 Chandler:Can you figure out what I’m doing?
 Chandler:Who?
 Chandler:Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
 Chandler:What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
 Chandler:Okay I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
 Chandler:(she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing I I guess you remember me.
 Chandler:(To Monica) It’s a nickname I’ll explain later.
 Chandler:Ah uh I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
 Chandler:You-you-you didn’t know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well I guess my work here is done!
 Chandler:As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
 Chandler:I would really love it if could do both.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:A hundred and forty-five pounds.
 Chandler:Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody but I was 15!
 Chandler:Okay. Okay now wait a minute that was totally different.
 Chandler:You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
 Chandler:Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
 Chandler:So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
 Chandler:I’d carry you around in my pocket.
 Chandler:Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.
 Chandler:…Come on! Why are we here?!
 Chandler:The hot chicks?
 Chandler:Wow that’s actually pretty cool.
 Chandler:Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
 Chandler:You didn’t bring me here to do that did you?
 Chandler:OH…MY…GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie are you okay? You didn’t tell her we were getting married did you?
 Chandler:Did she freak out?
 Chandler:Right.
 Chandler:(laughs) You said no right?
 Chandler:You said no right?!
 Chandler:Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check’s in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can’t wait to read your book Ross!!
 Chandler:What do you think she’s just gonna sit there quietly? You don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
 Chandler:Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what? She’s probably not gonna even want to come.
 Chandler:No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
 Chandler:Yes!!
 Chandler:Yes!!!
 Chandler:Well actually uh there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh tiny! We’re not even sure why we’re having it.
 Chandler:I say we go with Careless Whisper.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
 Chandler:Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?
 Chandler:No-no-no-no if we let her stay she will stay forever!
 Chandler:Is that what you’re thinking about right now?
 Chandler:Janice I’m sorry but umm you can’t stay here tonight.
 Chandler:Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized but sadly you have not.
 Chandler:Say again?
 Chandler:Feelings such strong feelings.
 Chandler:I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)
 Chandler:No no no. No-no-no.
 Chandler:No we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
 Chandler:Now that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica).
 Chandler:Oh okay time's up!
 Chandler:Oh that's not bad Pheebs?
 Chandler:Okay so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables Joey?
 Chandler:Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list) There you go.
 Chandler:Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up Ross' pad)
 Chandler:Uh Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad)
 Chandler:I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross time is up!
 Chandler:Look Ross if you don't know them by now you will never know them okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
 Chandler:Okay but if you can't…no dinner!
 Chandler:Sure and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
 Chandler:I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
 Chandler:Which smells delicious!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Tell her I'm allergic and I will sue!
 Chandler:Huh! Where is the dog?!
 Chandler:Phoebe we can hear the dog barking!
 Chandler:What is it doing here?
 Chandler:Extremely allergic okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes my throat will just close up!
 Chandler:(gasping) Really?
 Chandler:Well it still has to go right?
 Chandler:Okay it's um…
 Chandler:(to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say Do what you have to do) Okay I hate dogs.
 Chandler:They are needy they are jumpy and you can't tell what they are thinking and that scares me a little bit.
 Chandler:(scared) Is there a puppy here?
 Chandler:(to Tag) Okay you are new!
 Chandler:Okay it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
 Chandler:And I don't wanna say this I don't you guys to hate me but uh I don't think I can be around that dog anymore. Okay so either the dog goes or I go. (An awkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!
 Chandler:(comes out of the bathroom) Here I am.
 Chandler:How did you…know? (Heads back into the bathroom)
 Chandler:(comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica?
 Chandler:Why not?
 Chandler:Well I I should go in there.
 Chandler:Why not?
 Chandler:This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom)
 Chandler:Monica's all upset because I sent Clunkers away.
 Chandler:Yeah I can be a hero I could do that. I could I could do... I w-w-what if what if it attacks me?
 Chandler:And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out)
 Chandler:No no he went for a walk.
 Chandler:Please please please don't be mad at me.
 Chandler:Okay I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y’know for you and…(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere all over the apartment including the roof which FYI Ross one of your neighbors growing weed. I couldn't find him and I am so so so sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and then over to the street)
 Chandler:Clunkers?! Oh my god!
 Chandler:(to Clunkers) It is so good to see you!
 Chandler:It's up to you.
 Chandler:All right.
 Chandler:You got it. (Starts looking at the pad while Ross got the turkey out of the fridge and starts to unwrap and it) You got Nevada twice.
 Chandler:Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)
 Chandler:Okay let me just straighten out your helmet there. (Does so.)
 Chandler:Okay. Okay.
 Chandler:That sounds like my first bike. (They all turn and look at him.) My dad gave me his old one.
 Chandler:Hey! What are you guys doing?
 Chandler:I’m sorry who?
 Chandler:But we don’t know the neighbors.
 Chandler:Wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved?
 Chandler:Eh somebody’s in a good mood!
 Chandler:Well either that or uh…(Motions towards Joey’s door.)
 Chandler:(about to cry) Am not!
 Chandler:Don’t worry I’m brave! I am brave! I…I am brave! (They get to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through the door.) Can you tell me who is there please?
 Chandler:(laughs) 400 A.M.
 Chandler:I am sorry but some of us have to get up early and go to work! (Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us.
 Chandler:Mm! Night Gar’! (Monica closes the door.)
 Chandler:Hey you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
 Chandler:Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
 Chandler:(with his mouth full) What happened? I’m just eating candy.
 Chandler:Absolutely! Y’know because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
 Chandler:What is the matter with you?
 Chandler:Maybe isn’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
 Chandler:Y’know what would work?
 Chandler:Stop making candy!
 Chandler:You mean they like you.
 Chandler:Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
 Chandler:(asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on?
 Chandler:Joey!
 Chandler:What are you doing?
 Chandler:Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-Lot Lady standing next to the door and smoking to her) Hey and you can not smoke in here! (Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy) Merry Christmas.
 Chandler:All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! (They settle down) What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you and I’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
 Chandler:No not (imitating) Candy Lady.
 Chandler:All right y’know what? Forget it all of you forget it! You’ve ruined it! Go home! You’ve ruined it! You’ve ruined it!
 Chandler:You’re welcome. (They kiss.)
 Chandler:No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh—are you okay?
 Chandler:Buh-bye. (Hangs up the phone) I just got us reservations at Michelle’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
 Chandler:…betrothed couple.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Pheebs?
 Chandler:Skull?
 Chandler:How long have we been home?
 Chandler:Lovely!
 Chandler:Hey you know what I was thinking? When we get married are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
 Chandler:Why not?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
 Chandler:Well she's just so much fun with Joey I just assumed she'd still be living with him.
 Chandler:No reason except…she…told…me.
 Chandler:No! No she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
 Chandler:Bing doesn't seem so weird now does it?
 Chandler:(to the Maitre d') Hi could we get two burritos to go please? (Laughs.)
 Chandler:Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 800.
 Chandler:Is this because of the burrito thing?
 Chandler:Give him money? It was a joke!
 Chandler:Right calm down O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
 Chandler:Hey I can be smooth. (Walks back to the Maitre d' very smoothly) Listen we're a little bit in a hurry so if you can get us a table a little quicker I'd appreciate it. (Shakes his hand)
 Chandler:Okay. (Walks back to Monica)
 Chandler:Had the money in the wrong hand. (Shows her his left hand with the money in it)
 Chandler:How do you know so much about this?
 Chandler:Richard used to do it didn't he?
 Chandler:Mustached bastard…
 Chandler:(walks up to the Maitre d') Excuse me...
 Chandler:(finds his money) Ahh-hahaha! (Turns around to give the Maitre d' his money but he isn't there anymore)
 Chandler:Thank you Gunther put it there. (He gets up and shakes Gunther's hand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely not easier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up the coins. Chandler thinks Joey is just helping him to pick them up.) Thank you.
 Chandler:Hey Pheebs!
 Chandler:If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building why not get him something a little bit more subtle like a wrecking ball or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
 Chandler:(entering in a Santa costume) Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!
 Chandler:Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
 Chandler:Well I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here weird…turtle-man?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:You bet I did Ben put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand but the money falls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well it would have worked this time if his hands weren't so damn small! (Realizes that Ben is standing right there) Ho ho ho!
 Chandler:You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
 Chandler:Fine I'll give the suit back.
 Chandler:Santa? Really?
 Chandler:Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
 Chandler:Then it's okay! (They kiss.)
 Chandler:Because if Santa and the Holiday…Armadillo? (Ross nods) ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
 Chandler:Well I'll stay but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
 Chandler:My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt. (Glaring at Joey who’s nodding.)
 Chandler:Buh-bye. (Hangs up the phone) I just got us reservations at Michelle’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
 Chandler:…betrothed couple.
 Chandler:Hey!

 Chandler:My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt. (Glaring at Joey who’s nodding.)
 Chandler:(looking up with her) That’s a plane!
 Chandler:(with a quivering voice) No I’m not!
 Chandler:Because it’s flattering! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come on Monica! (He goes inside.)
 Chandler:(whispering) Monica!
 Chandler:I know just quick-quick question quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
 Chandler:Sorry I just…can’t sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light and Monica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I’m like…(Fake snores.)
 Chandler:What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed and heads into the living room.)
 Chandler:Shhhhhhhhh!!! (Monica enters) I’m sorry I thought maybe I’d make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
 Chandler:It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
 Chandler:Hey y’know what we can do? Y’know now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long y’know like we did when we were first going out. It’d be fun!
 Chandler:Okay so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
 Chandler:(Pause) No. No I-I was I was talking about the book I was reading.
 Chandler:That’s correct.
 Chandler:(startled) What? What? What?
 Chandler:Yeah! You?
 Chandler:(intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope you’re not thinking about cleaning the living room.
 Chandler:Do you know what just happened?
 Chandler:No. We were in the middle of sex…and you fell asleep.
 Chandler:(turning the light back on) Monica?
 Chandler:I was giving you some of my best moves and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Don’t fall asleep! Okay I am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesn’t move as he gets out of bed and as he’s heading for the door.) And I probably won’t spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
 Chandler:Hm-hmm I told you! (Looks at the clock) I can’t believe that I’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
 Chandler:Well you’re not gonna believe this but if you have seven minutes…
 Chandler:Do you wanna?
 Chandler:Couldn’t I just say This is Ross?
 Chandler:(knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.)
 Chandler:Joey! Joe! (Sees that he’s not here and starts investigating. He picks up the bag of chips.) Full bag. (He picks up the beer.) Beer’s still cold. Something terrible must’ve happened here! (He decides it’s not that important; sits down on Rosita and the back falls off causing him to flip over.) Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! (Runs over to Stevie.) Stevie I was never here! (Runs out.)
 Chandler:My chair. Now if anybody asks your name is Rosita! (He runs out the door grabs the back of Rosita and we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are coming up the stairs. Neither of them have reached the landing yet.)
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Yeah I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore.
 Chandler:(excitedly) Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
 Chandler:That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?!
 Chandler:Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey’s chair?
 Chandler:I thought I broke Joey’s chair! That’s why I replaced it with mine!
 Chandler:Well what did you think that-that elves came in and fixed it?
 Chandler:I’m gettin’ my chair back! (Heads for Joey and Rachel’s.)
 Chandler:Joey you broke my chair!!
 Chandler:I think I should get the chair!
 Chandler:Because you (Points to Joey) broke a chair and you (Points to Rachel) broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn’t broke a chair is me!
 Chandler:Well where’s the logic in that?!
 Chandler:So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
 Chandler:What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
 Chandler:(To Monica) She’s not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
 Chandler:No Rach it’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn’t that much fun.
 Chandler:Ross a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
 Chandler:(To Joey) Would you put that back on?! Monica’s gonna be here any minute!
 Chandler:(frustrated) Okay for the last time. It’s not named for each individual man.
 Chandler:Oh well not as lovely as you. I mean I can’t believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And you! I can’t believe that you would have a tux that’s thirty years old! (Puts his hand on Mr. Geller’s shoulder.)
 Chandler:Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)
 Chandler:Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! (Rachel turns off the lights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches a ripping noise erupts from the assemblage.)
 Chandler:(getting up to investigate) Okay everybody stay here. I will find out what’s going on.
 Chandler:Hey-hey are you drunk?
 Chandler:Okay here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
 Chandler:Yes!
 Chandler:Yes!!
 Chandler:Okay here’s the thing. We’re gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you’re drunk.
 Chandler:Yeah I’ll take care of it.
 Chandler:(laughing) Okay we have to do something about your breath.
 Chandler:That’s still yours. Okay now remember it’s a surprise party. So when you go in act surprised.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Okay before we start the celebration Monica has to go put on her party dress.
 Chandler:See? (Does his laugh.) Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room and has to pass in front of Mr. Geller who’s sitting at the table and Mrs. Geller who’s standing next to him.)
 Chandler:(correcting her) Phil.
 Chandler:Now there is a dress laid out on your bed. (Monica stumbles on the steps.) Okay (catches her) you’re doing great. You’re doing great. You’re doing fine.
 Chandler:Monica’s a little drunk.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe) She doesn’t want her parents to know she’s drunk.
 Chandler:Monica’s wasted.
 Chandler:(To Rachel) Okay will you just go help her change please!
 Chandler:Okay open ours next. Open ours next!
 Chandler:For my last birthday you gave me a hug! (To Rachel) Okay read the card! Read the card!
 Chandler:No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
 Chandler:No because you’re not a grandmother!
 Chandler:(to a waiter) Oh that’s great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? (The waiter comes over) There we go.
 Chandler:(To Monica) How are you feeling?
 Chandler:(To Monica) Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more okay? Then we can put you in bed okay? Just smile and don’t talk to anyone.
 Chandler:Pheebs!!
 Chandler:I think it’s necessary. (Backs away anyhow.)
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Okay here we go.
 Chandler:Hey! How’d it go?
 Chandler:Well here we are just a bunch of thirty year olds.
 Chandler:(To Ross) Monica said wedding.
 Chandler:Do you think you could get through a poem?
 Chandler:Too?
 Chandler:Well whatever it is I hope it involves winking. (Winks in a spy-type manner.)
 Chandler:That’s great!
 Chandler:So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
 Chandler:Don’t do it.
 Chandler:I think it’s the dying cat parade.
 Chandler:(turning around and looking) Oh my God!
 Chandler:Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said You’re half Scottish right?
 Chandler:Yes!!
 Chandler:Why is your family Ross?!
 Chandler:If you listen very carefully I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
 Chandler:Well I feel like a snack!
 Chandler:Oh no thanks. I don’t like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
 Chandler:Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway lots of bad memories. (Makes a few unintelligible noises.)
 Chandler:We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
 Chandler:That’s not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
 Chandler:Because we hate them.
 Chandler:We have heard you play.
 Chandler:You mean the spitter?
 Chandler:Easy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a veil.
 Chandler:You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
 Chandler:Sorry I just don’t like the idea of when I say I do he’s thinking Yeah I’d do her too!
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
 Chandler:We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean gay and in control of his saliva!
 Chandler:No but Horny for Monica Minister called wanting to know if we were still together.
 Chandler:Joe…
 Chandler:(To Monica) Y’know we haven’t found anybody else.
 Chandler:Yeah you can do it.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Our minister…
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Should we call the spitter?
 Chandler:Yeah. O-okay.
 Chandler:See Joe not that that’s not grrreat! But one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y’know it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
 Chandler:No not us… (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)
 Chandler:See Joe we want you to tell stories but y’know romantic stories. Nice stories.
 Chandler:Joe?
 Chandler:Isn’t that what happened with you and the bride’s maid?
 Chandler:And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
 Chandler:But then later that night…
 Chandler:(answering the door) Hey!
 Chandler:Well I was… I was exactly expecting company after…(He looks at his watch.) 915.
 Chandler:Well last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh you’re not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
 Chandler:Well look it’s been a really emotional time y’know and you’ve had a lot to drink. And you’ve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
 Chandler:You kidding? You’re the most beautiful woman in most rooms… (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
 Chandler:But we don’t do that.
 Chandler:How drunk are you?
 Chandler:(thinks) That’s the perfect amount!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:Well I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
 Chandler:Yep!
 Chandler:Count of three?
 Chandler:Two!
 Chandler:Well I think it’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
 Chandler:Eh!
 Chandler:Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers as Joey enters. Remember?)
 Chandler:Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e… (Notices that the TV is turned off.)
 Chandler:No! No! No!
 Chandler:They’re in my bag over there. (Points.)
 Chandler:Uh could you leave me one?
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:No I-I-I’m fine.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Who did you originally want to hook up with?
 Chandler:(To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
 Chandler:Oh it’s not important? It’s not important?! If it wasn’t for a bride’s maid you’d be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!
 Chandler:I don’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I’m runner up.
 Chandler:(To Joey) Look there is no way you’re doing this wedding now. Okay?
 Chandler:Okay it’s just weird! Okay? I don’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…I don’t know what I need. I need a walk.
 Chandler:It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman and instead you had to settle for Robin. (Walks out and slams the door.)
 Chandler:Hey. Do you want this scone? (Holds up his plate) It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
 Chandler:Look Joe I know you wanted to do the wedding…
 Chandler:How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
 Chandler:That’s what you should say.
 Chandler:When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say.
 Chandler:I’d love it if you would do it.
 Chandler:But those are the words! Those exact words!
 Chandler:Yeah we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
 Chandler:So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we’re trying to get to play at the wedding?
 Chandler:Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
 Chandler:Gap commercial. (To Monica) So did you book them? Did you call?
 Chandler:Do you want me to call?
 Chandler:Staying out of the way.
 Chandler:Sure! That’s one of the great things about being engaged. I’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
 Chandler:(To Ross) Smooth.
 Chandler:So Ross how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
 Chandler:Huh.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Uh Joe when it’s one o’clock in the morning and you don’t come by? That’s okay!
 Chandler:Really? Right across the street?
 Chandler:When’d you meet her?
 Chandler:Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too!
 Chandler:Hi! How’d it go?
 Chandler:(sarcastically shocked) Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross’s situation?
 Chandler:So this is nice! I wish I didn’t have to go believe me! But unfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh by the way what’s the name the girl you’re dating?
 Chandler:Bye! (Exits.)
 Chandler:Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (He goes into the bathroom to wash his hands.)
 Chandler:(returning) What are you guys talking about?
 Chandler:But I love swing music!
 Chandler:Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them we had fun! And there’s another reason too.
 Chandler:I don’t want to say.
 Chandler:Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
 Chandler:Hi honey! I’m home!
 Chandler:Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
 Chandler:Y’know it’s funny I started it but now it’s scary me. So could you come out here please?
 Chandler:Oh you got a wedding dress? That’s great!
 Chandler:Well then why can’t I see it?
 Chandler:Okay I promise. I’ll-I’ll hate it. (She enters.) Wow! You-you look…hideous.
 Chandler:Yeah that’s like the most ugliest dress I’ve ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
 Chandler:Oh that’s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it’s like yuck! It’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:(without turning around) I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
 Chandler:Oh totally! (Holds up his finger.) Pull my finger.
 Chandler:Okay. Well I think the centerpieces are too big
 Chandler:Kinda. They’re really big.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:No. No see when I first meet somebody it’s uh it’s mostly panic anxiety and a great deal of sweating.
 Chandler:Sleeping with somebody new anxiety panic and I’m afraid even more sweating.
 Chandler:I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. (Monica laughs.) Look for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
 Chandler:Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts I’m back to panic anxiety and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
 Chandler:(hoarsely) Water! Water! Water!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
 Chandler:Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…
 Chandler:Technically we could have sex again. What do you think bossy and domineering?!
 Chandler:That’s me! Come on!
 Chandler:Well get rid of her obsessive and shrill.
 Chandler:(transfixed) Hi! Nice to meet you!
 Chandler:I’ll be right with you.
 Chandler:I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch. (Stares at Monica’s eyes.) Say something.
 Chandler:Umm so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
 Chandler:This is so sad. I mean I only have like ten pins.
 Chandler:Y’know I think we should invite them.
 Chandler:Well this is just sad!
 Chandler:Well thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
 Chandler:(sees another rack) Well what’s the deal with these? These-these look nice.
 Chandler:You mean like for award shows?
 Chandler:You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!
 Chandler:Okay who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)
 Chandler:Not bad.
 Chandler:Who’s that?
 Chandler:Pierce Brosnan?
 Chandler:Are you serious?
 Chandler:007?! This is James Bond’s tux?!
 Chandler:Oh I have to get married in James Bond’s tux!
 Chandler:Oh it’s not just that I would be England’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?
 Chandler:A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James Bond’s tux!
 Chandler:So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.
 Chandler:Please don’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
 Chandler:Look it’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
 Chandler:That was pretty 007.
 Chandler:Ross is Batman!
 Chandler:Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
 Chandler:Batman has a utility belt!
 Chandler:Batman has the Batmobile!
 Chandler:Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get ESPN right?
 Chandler:Actually I don’t like martinis.
 Chandler:Ooh yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)
 Chandler:I would but mine doesn’t fit. The pants are a little tight.
 Chandler:Well does that mean that you’re not going to wearing yours?
 Chandler:(standing up) Let me try it on!
 Chandler:(trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds something in the pocket) What’s this?
 Chandler:An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
 Chandler:The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. (Hands him the jacket and walks away.)
 Chandler:Well you’re welcome. And tell them we’re really glad they’re coming.
 Chandler:(yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!
 Chandler:Whose is it?
 Chandler:Whose is it?
 Chandler:Oh come on! I don’t care! Come on! Whose is it?
 Chandler:Do you realize you get louder each week?
 Chandler:I figured I’d buy those. Pat I’d like to buy a vow. (Laughs)
 Chandler:Right. So uh have you written yours yet?
 Chandler:Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?
 Chandler:(watching in her) (in his head) Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What’s wrong with me? Ooh don’t open that door.
 Chandler:(writing) Monica there are no words… (To Joey and Ross) There are no words! This should not be this hard!
 Chandler:I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should’ve seen her. Writing writing writing!
 Chandler:Yeah I’m not sure I can do that.
 Chandler:(seeing her) Okay.
 Chandler:All right there’s a nuclear holocaust I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
 Chandler:(shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) That’s one?
 Chandler:Oh y’know-y’know what I was looking at it upside down.
 Chandler:(writing) Monica…
 Chandler:(writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?
 Chandler:You'll get one.
 Chandler:All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40 if neither one of us are married what do you say you and I get together and have one?
 Chandler:Oh no no. I just meant hypothetically.
 Chandler:No no no.
 Chandler:(trapped) Uh uh.
 Chandler:Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
 Chandler:Nice try.
 Chandler:Look Monica…
 Chandler:This is not going to work.
 Chandler:You are so great! I love you!
 Chandler:Nothing! I said I said You're so great and then I just I just stopped talking!
 Chandler:No I didn't!
 Chandler:No I didn't!
 Chandler:No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
 Chandler: Y’know I was thinking what if I uh unpack here?
 Chandler:Well what if all my stuff was here?
 Chandler:Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?
 Chandler:Oh my God.
 Chandler:Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God I thought… (Starting to cry pauses) Wait a minute I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you’ll let me I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica will you marry me?
 Chandler:I've had a very long hard day.
 Chandler:Ahh no thanks. No chicken bye-bye then.
 Chandler:Are you okay? I'm so sorry he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
 Chandler:Hey Joe!
 Chandler:Yeah can I get a 3-piece some cole slaw some beans and a Coke—(Yelps in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)—Diet Coke.
 Chandler:It happened in London.
 Chandler:The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
 Chandler:No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
 Chandler:(on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
 Chandler:(after they've left) Okay did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
 Chandler:Okay so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
 Chandler:Phoebe knows about us!
 Chandler:Ahh yes the messers become the messies!
 Chandler:Listen this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
 Chandler:Look she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)
 Chandler:Okay give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
 Chandler:Oh you're-you're going?
 Chandler:(swallowing hard) It's very very nice. Well come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
 Chandler:Not if I kiss you first.
 Chandler:Well I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
 Chandler:Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
 Chandler:Because I'm in love with Monica!!
 Chandler:Love her! That's right I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you Monica.
 Chandler:Yes and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
 Chandler:Who are those people?
 Chandler:What’s going on?
 Chandler:So we both finished our vows.
 Chandler:Don’t worry honey we’ll make yours funnier.
 Chandler:Okay what do you guys think?
 Chandler:You really like it?
 Chandler:I stole Monica’s and changed the name.
 Chandler:Oh! Right. Umm maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation.
 Chandler:I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not the close. I haven’t seen him in years.
 Chandler:Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
 Chandler:Trust me you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
 Chandler:What’s this?
 Chandler:Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—Think of the money we’ll save!! (Monica just looks at him.) We’re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
 Chandler:Y’know we already went over this and I won!
 Chandler:Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see him. I don’t wanna.
 Chandler:No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedoes—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
 Chandler:He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
 Chandler:Does it matter?!
 Chandler:Yeah o-okay but I’m just doing this for you.
 Chandler:So I really never get to win anymore?
 Chandler:Yeah I just ordered a beer! (Pounds the table.)
 Chandler:No! No! I don’t want him to know we’re yet! I’m not sure I’m ready for that. And besides he’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.
 Chandler:I don’t know if I’ve told you this but he’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
 Chandler:Yeah he’s made phone calls written letters he even came to New York but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y’know it’s all very Cats in the Cradle—I don’t want to get into it. (The show starts.) Here we go.
 Chandler:And there’s daddy!
 Chandler:Believe me I’ve been saying that for years. Oh my God!
 Chandler:That’s Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
 Chandler:He’s coming into the audience. He’s coming into the audience.
 Chandler:It can’t happen like this. Okay? I’ll meet you back at the hotel.
 Chandler:(resigning himself to his fate) Chandler. (He quickly sits down.)
 Chandler:Oh they’re a hoot.
 Chandler:Actually Monica and I are engaged.
 Chandler:Wait! Wait! We’d really love it if you could be there.
 Chandler:I know it would make me happy ma’am.
 Chandler:Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
 Chandler:(To Monica) When I was growing up I…played the one on the far left.
 Chandler:Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
 Chandler:The young hot ball and chain.
 Chandler:What’s up?
 Chandler:Listen if you want to borrow money its kind of a bad time. I’m buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
 Chandler:But you’re still my friend?
 Chandler:During this time…are you are you still my best man?
 Chandler:Do I still call you Ross?
 Chandler:(smiling) Hey I hear what your saying okay? And thanks for the warning.
 Chandler:So are we…friends again?
 Chandler:Okay. (Pause) You won’t believe what Monica’s older brother just said to me!
 Chandler:(entering from the bedroom) Okay. Here’s a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
 Chandler:Yes include more people in this.
 Chandler:Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
 Chandler:Well you don’t have to sound so surprised.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Honestly? Me too.
 Chandler:Yeah. Y’know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I’ll go all…Chandler. But nothing has.
 Chandler:Okay. I’ll be right there.
 Chandler:We’re the Bings.
 Chandler:Mr. and Mrs. Bing! (Walks away.)
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:Mom. Thanks for wearing something. (They hug.) (She’s wearing a tight dress with a lot of cleavage showing.)
 Chandler:Hi…dad.
 Chandler:Oh my God! (He and Monica walk away.)
 Chandler:How did you guys find me? I knew I should’ve hid at the gym!
 Chandler:Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I’m related to Monica. How is she?
 Chandler:No! No! No! I can’t do that!
 Chandler:Because if I go home we’re gonna become the Bings! I can’t be the Bings!
 Chandler:The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
 Chandler:No.
 Chandler:It’s not just their marriage! I mean look at yours. Look at everybody’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don’t race cars! I don’t make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
 Chandler:I want to. I love her so much but I’m afr…It’s too huge.
 Chandler:Well yeah but then…
 Chandler:Depends on what you mean by we.
 Chandler:No.
 Chandler:Yeah okay. Well what’s the next little bit?
 Chandler:Yeah. You’re right. Hey I-I can do that.
 Chandler:Okay excuse me for a minute. (Starts to leave)
 Chandler:Ross I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Oh fresh air!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Ross! (He starts to get up.)
 Chandler:(standing up) That’s right! I’m not!
 Chandler:I know about Monica.
 Chandler:Yeah I heard you and Rachel talking.
 Chandler:You don’t know?
 Chandler:Monica’s pregnant.
 Chandler:Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes…
 Chandler:Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop and that’s when I uh saw this. (He holds up a little tiny baby jumper that reads I (heart) New York.) Yeah y’know what? I thought anything that can fit into this can’t be scary.
 Chandler:But come on look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she’d know I was okay.
 Chandler:You look beautiful mom. (His dad clears his throat.) You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. (He kisses his dad on the cheek) I’m so glad you here. (He kisses his mom.)
 Chandler:Are you Joey?
 Chandler:You look beautiful. Is this new? (Her dress.)
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:(in Monica’s ear) He’s Greek Orthodox.
 Chandler:(To Ross) No that’s okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it’s okay because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I’m sure? (He leans in and kisses her.)
 Chandler:I do.
 Chandler:(To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.
 Chandler:Our baby.
 Chandler:Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
 Chandler:Then…who did?
 Chandler:What?! What are you talking about?
 Chandler:Who’s the father?
 Chandler:Why not?
 Chandler:As in Barbara Streisand’s husband James Brolin?
 Chandler:Y’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
 Chandler:Before we go out there I’ve got a present for ya.
 Chandler:No?
 Chandler:I’ve been taking dancing lessons.
 Chandler:Yeah the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.
 Chandler:So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
 Chandler:I don’t know it’s these new shoes they’re all slippery.
 Chandler:Not well.
 Chandler:Thank you.
 Chandler:Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
 Chandler:Funny ha-ha or funny (Mimes blowing his brain out.)
 Chandler:What size shoes do you wear?
 Chandler:Great because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor can I borrow the boots from your costume?
 Chandler:(looking at Joey’s feet) Those aren’t eleven and a half.
 Chandler:And the world will never know.
 Chandler:Yes I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.
 Chandler:But you’re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
 Chandler:Did it turn into sand?
 Chandler:(sliding up behind her) No. No I won’t. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See for the first time I didn’t want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:(to the front desk clerk) Hi! We’re checking out of the bridal suite.
 Chandler:And I’m the happiest guy in the world! (Monica goes and sits down in a huff.) Oh honey come on don’t be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!
 Chandler:We got the honeymoon.
 Chandler:The wedding pictures?
 Chandler:Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
 Chandler:I’ll tell you what I will go get them developed and you can go home.
 Chandler:What? What did you take a picture of?
 Chandler:Okay Ross has the cameras has he checked out yet?
 Chandler:Oh.
 Chandler:Okay well I’m gonna get Ross get the cameras and get them developed. (Joey laughs again.) 32 Joe. You’re 32! (Exits)
 Chandler:Hey. (He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
 Chandler:Yeah but you don’t need—(Picks up something)—What is this?
 Chandler:Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
 Chandler:The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
 Chandler:Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake I went up to you and I said…
 Chandler:So you don’t have the cameras?!
 Chandler:So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!
 Chandler:Great.
 Chandler:Hey! Did you find the cameras?
 Chandler:Yes! And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating.
 Chandler:Well this is great. Y’know those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today she’s really depressed.
 Chandler:All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’t believe I screwed this up!
 Chandler:Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
 Chandler:Are you serious?
 Chandler:Marriage advice? Really?!
 Chandler:I don’t know Monica picked out the flowers.
 Chandler:She picked those out too.
 Chandler:That was her.
 Chandler:I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
 Chandler:(to another couple) Uh excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?
 Chandler:Uhh… Yeah sure. (Holds the camera up to his face.) Click!
 Chandler:Oh yeah. I’ll take I’ll take your picture. (He takes the picture with his finger over the lens.)
 Chandler:Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
 Chandler:Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.
 Chandler:Okay you ready for the last picture?
 Chandler:Get ready to run. (Chandler walks over to the new bride.) Congratulations on your wedding. (He grabs her kisses her Ross takes the picture and they both run out.)
 Chandler:We’re back!
 Chandler:It’s picture time.
 Chandler:(showing her the pictures) Here’s a picture of Ross. (Shows another one.) And that’s me. (Another one.) And that’s me and Ross. (Another one.) Oh-ho that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.
 Chandler:Eh?
 Chandler:Okay so this isn’t a picture of our first but it is a picture of my first kiss with…with this lady. Which by the look on your face I’m sure you’ll remember. So we don’t need—(Rips the picture)—There’s no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.
 Chandler:Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
 Chandler:Call it even?!
 Chandler:Hey! Babe! Aren’t you excited we’re going on our honeymoon?
 Chandler:(singing) Bermuda Bahama come on pretty mama…
 Chandler:I’d better go pack.
 Chandler:A Speedo? Uh I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit. (Goes into the bedroom.)
 Chandler:(entering) Hey what was that all about?
 Chandler:(in a high pitched voice) What?! I didn’t even know that—Why didn’t you tell me?! (Pause) Why am I talking like this?!
 Chandler:(in the high pitched voice) What?! (Normal voice) I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
 Chandler:Oh no-no Joey I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.
 Chandler:You already know.
 Chandler:Oh honey leave them alone they’re in love.
 Chandler:We are on our honeymoon.
 Chandler:25J and K any chance those aren’t together?
 Chandler:No.
 Chandler:Just act like you belong.
 Chandler:Shh! (To the guy behind the counter) Nice to see you again. (They tries to walk past him.)
 Chandler:Yes of course. (Shows him the tickets.)
 Chandler:Oh that’s all right I have it memorized. It’s 1A.
 Chandler:Apology accepted. Excuse us. (They try to enter again.)
 Chandler:Oh you’ve got to be kidding me.
 Chandler:We’re you just ten seconds later!
 Chandler:(looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff.
 Chandler:What else is new?
 Chandler:Wait. Before we go in I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon and I can’t wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.
 Chandler:They’re terrific and they live right here in the city.
 Chandler:I’m sorry we’re just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.
 Chandler:Listen they are really great. If you just got a chance…
 Chandler:We really…didn’t get a chance to…
 Chandler:Ross! It’s got your wavy black lines!
 Chandler:Y’know who has a great video camera?
 Chandler:Let’s call ‘em.
 Chandler:Here you go. (Shows her the number again.)
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:I don’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful great questions.
 Chandler:Yeah we’re gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of them agree.)
 Chandler:I still don’t get it we didn’t do anything wrong.
 Chandler:I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
 Chandler:Well maybe it was all of your questions.
 Chandler:The sheer volume it was like flying with the Riddler!
 Chandler:(angrily) Was that another question?
 Chandler:Did you do it on our invitations?!
 Chandler:So just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (Slams the framed invitation down onto the table.)
 Chandler:That’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
 Chandler:Jenny! That is so Jenny!
 Chandler:You know me sir. Oh ah I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
 Chandler:What’s funny about that?
 Chandler:Hey that’s okay. So where do you want to go?
 Chandler:The Hard Rock Caf�?
 Chandler:Again?!
 Chandler:You like the Purple Rain display! (A guy walks up.) Hey Bob.
 Chandler:Yeah he thinks that’s my name.
 Chandler:Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway so I didn’t say anything. And then the next time he said Hey Toby do you want a donut? And I-I wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later the donut’s gone and I’m still Toby.
 Chandler:No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides we work in different departments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What’s the big deal? It could be worse it’s not like he’s calling me Muriel. (Chandler suddenly freezes into place.)
 Chandler:Shh! It is a family name!
 Chandler:Hey Bob.
 Chandler:If I see him I’ll ask.
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:We’re on a semi-first name basis.
 Chandler:Bob? Ooh working here with us? Everyday? Yeah I don’t know if he has what it takes.
 Chandler:But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.
 Chandler:I think it’s best sir.
 Chandler:Y’know what you should do just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em.
 Chandler:What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
 Chandler:Sure what’s up?
 Chandler:Hey Bobby.
 Chandler:Uhh yeah. Yeah it’s (Points down the hall) right right down there. (When he has Bob looking down the hall he turns around and knocks his nameplate off of his door.) Right there yeah. Can I ask you why?
 Chandler:Okay Bob listen uhh I’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here.
 Chandler:Bob!
 Chandler:Well that puts me in a difficult position.
 Chandler:(entering) Bob. Bob! Bob!!! (He turns around) What the hell are you doing?!
 Chandler:You’re an actor!
 Chandler:(entering from the bedroom wearing a big pink bunny costume) Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen I appreciate you getting me the costume…
 Chandler:The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
 Chandler:No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
 Chandler:How is that me?
 Chandler:When have I ever done that?!
 Chandler:Wow! I don’t have the worst costume anymore!
 Chandler:Oh! Hi!
 Chandler:Joey’s gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you’d come by as a slutty nurse.
 Chandler:You’d think that would embarrass me but you see I’m maxed out.
 Chandler:(To Ross) Marry her.
 Chandler:Howdy doody.
 Chandler:Oh relax man relax. You’re looking a little flushed.
 Chandler:What question?
 Chandler:There’s no question.
 Chandler:(To Monica) You picked Ross?!
 Chandler:I cannot believe you didn’t pick me.
 Chandler:Oh really?! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you prove it? (He pushes Ross who starts to fall backwards until Mona catches him.)
 Chandler:(To Ross) You’re going down.
 Chandler:That means nothing to me. (To Ross) Come on!
 Chandler:And dignity.
 Chandler:Nope! I can do this all day.
 Chandler:God I’m exhausted.
 Chandler:No way! If anything you’ve gotta let me win! My wife thinks I’m a wimp!
 Chandler:You’re Spudnik.
 Chandler:Fine. (He lets Ross win.) Oh no!
 Chandler:Listen I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win.
 Chandler:No I let him win—Ross!
 Chandler:Would you tell her I let you win please?
 Chandler:I am strong! I’ll show you! (He sits down at the table.)
 Chandler:Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?
 Chandler:Okay. 1…2…3—Go! (Once again he’s at a stalemate but this time he’s in pain.) (Pause) I’m gonna kill myself!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Y’know uh I didn’t actually do this.
 Chandler:No it wasn’t you.
 Chandler:I got a maid. Yay!
 Chandler:Uh honey I know you don’t like to relinquish control…
 Chandler:Look she’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
 Chandler:Yes I distinctly remember ‘cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance okay?
 Chandler:What’s the matter?
 Chandler:See? I told you.
 Chandler:(pause) What?
 Chandler:So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
 Chandler:She must’ve been planning this for years!
 Chandler:Honey isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
 Chandler:So shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go…snooping around her crotch?
 Chandler:Out of curiosity what is your secret ingredient?
 Chandler:(entering) Hi!
 Chandler:How come?
 Chandler:To see her pants?
 Chandler:Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
 Chandler:God! She is not stealing from us! Okay will you let this go?
 Chandler:Oh dear God!
 Chandler:And yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.
 Chandler:Here’s another plan…No!
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:I fear a jury will see it the same way!
 Chandler:You see that?
 Chandler:All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
 Chandler:You need new clothes.
 Chandler:I’m leaning. This is where I lean.
 Chandler:Brenda a bee!
 Chandler:Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
 Chandler:You do?
 Chandler:I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I just see your bra?
 Chandler:Her what?!!
 Chandler:You had a bachelorette party?!
 Chandler:I thought we weren’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y’know we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
 Chandler:You went home with the waitress.
 Chandler:I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
 Chandler:My God! You must be good in bed!
 Chandler:She’s okay with Rachel and the baby?
 Chandler:Well you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you’re going down the same path but you’re really going down different ones.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Honey! That’s crazy! I don’t want you to get me a stripper…
 Chandler:Look I appreciate it but uh it’s a little creepy. Y’know? I’m not a bachelor anymore.
 Chandler:All right fine! But I’m only doing this for you!
 Chandler:And Joey.
 Chandler:Ah no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
 Chandler:I understand who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
 Chandler:What are you doing?
 Chandler:Okay. I can’t believe tomorrow’s the big day.
 Chandler:You’re right this is more fun.
 Chandler:Hi. (Joey blows on a noisemaker.)
 Chandler:That’s me.
 Chandler:Yeah yeah right over there.
 Chandler:That was weird.
 Chandler:So she’s a…
 Chandler:I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!
 Chandler:Could be. I mean technically she did strip we just we just missed it. (Walks towards the bedroom.) Ma’am are you also a stripper?
 Chandler:That is funny maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone.
 Chandler:Oh actually I’d rather you…Yeah go ahead. We’re gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
 Chandler:Why would she do that?
 Chandler:This is the worst bachelor party ever!
 Chandler:(To Joey) In a minute? What’s gonna happen in a minute?!
 Chandler:Why me?!
 Chandler:Which is why you should do it.
 Chandler:You do it!
 Chandler:All right Rock Paper Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! (Joey smirks.) What?
 Chandler:I don’t think we’ve actually done this before!
 Chandler:Well we…we still hang out.
 Chandler:Well y’know things are different. I’m…I’m married now.
 Chandler:Yeah I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we’ll make time to hang out with each other.
 Chandler:Her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt do you really want to talk about smoking?
 Chandler:Monica! Wait!
 Chandler:(puts on his crown) Carry on.
 Chandler:Could you not narrate?
 Chandler:I have no idea.
 Chandler:Yeah! I’m just pretending to watch the game so I don’t have to help out with stuff.
 Chandler:Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
 Chandler:Yeah! Anderson just scored again! (To Phoebe) There’s no Anderson.
 Chandler:Oh hey. I’d shake your hand but uh; I’m really into the game. Plus I think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next to each other.
 Chandler:I’m watching the game but I’m not deaf!
 Chandler:(To Phoebe) Y’know it’s been a while since we’ve screamed something. Maybe we should.
 Chandler:Oh come on!
 Chandler:Good game!
 Chandler:Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
 Chandler:(simultaneously) Detroit.
 Chandler:Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
 Chandler:I’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
 Chandler:Did she look 16?
 Chandler:Well she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
 Chandler:Yes I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
 Chandler:New haircut? (Monica nods ‘No.’) Necklace? (No) Dress? (No) Boots? (Monica nods ‘Yes.’) Boots!
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:I’m gonna miss being able to afford food.
 Chandler:She had a point. (Shows her the receipt.)
 Chandler:Yeah well too bad we’re gonna have to return them.
 Chandler:I have you.
 Chandler:Hey-hey.
 Chandler:You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. (Goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)
 Chandler:(returning to his seat) Hey!
 Chandler:(spinning around looking for him) I don’t think you did a very thorough job!
 Chandler:(opening the door) What’s wrong?
 Chandler:Oh don’t forget my office holiday party is tonight. (They go into the apartment.)
 Chandler:Now sweetie I know you don’t like my office parties but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a…supple leather lining.
 Chandler:Why not?
 Chandler:Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
 Chandler:You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts dresses and pants!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Y’know that party wasn’t bad.
 Chandler:I don’t see any uh cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
 Chandler:What honey it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let’s go.
 Chandler:What’s going on?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. (Pause) It’s oddly unsettling.
 Chandler:Hop on.
 Chandler:Honey I know you’re in pain right now but I’m a little turned on.
 Chandler:Okay ten blocks down. Five to go.
 Chandler:Oh I’m sorry! Do you need a break?
 Chandler:I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.
 Chandler:(pause) I don’t have your boots.
 Chandler:Well why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!
 Chandler:Honey are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
 Chandler:Y’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
 Chandler:Okay. (Moves closer to the window.)
 Chandler:Honey you remember my boss Doug right?
 Chandler:I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced I’m sorry.
 Chandler:No.
 Chandler:Oh yeah. Boy urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn’t it?
 Chandler:Oh uh as it turns out we can’t do it. Monica has to work.
 Chandler:Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.
 Chandler:It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.
 Chandler:Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.
 Chandler:Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
 Chandler:Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell with that bitch.
 Chandler:Oh that’s all right sir and that’s just one girl.
 Chandler:It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no!
 Chandler:Hi honey I’m home.
 Chandler:It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars and then when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring he threw a soda can at a bird!
 Chandler:Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me that we will grow old together and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
 Chandler:Ooh I don’t know if we’re there yet.
 Chandler:Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
 Chandler:Pheebs you didn’t have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang…
 Chandler:Oh okay.
 Chandler:I kinda like it here.
 Chandler:Well what did it do?
 Chandler:A vending machine?
 Chandler:Who cares? It’s a stupid game.
 Chandler:I don’t suck. It’s sucks. You suck.
 Chandler:Why do you want to play this game so bad?
 Chandler:You are not going to believe what I did today!
 Chandler:I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. (Pause) Although I-I hope they don’t.
 Chandler:Uh-huh and I got all the top ten scores I erased Phoebe off the board! High five! (Holds up his hand to give Monica a high five only he can’t straighten his fingers.)
 Chandler:Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours it’ll loosen up. Come on check out the scores. Oh and also look at the initials they’re dirty words.
 Chandler:Because it’s awesome.
 Chandler:Well y’know they only give you three letters so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.
 Chandler:It is when you put it together with that one.
 Chandler:Come on he won’t even know what they mean.
 Chandler:Have you talked to him lately?
 Chandler:No-no-no if you unplug it I’ll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. (She unplugs it.) No! (And plugs it back in.) Hey look at that! Look at that it’s still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM (Read Only Memory it’s a memory chip.) Chip in it or something!
 Chandler:With the claw?!
 Chandler:(smiles) Pull my finger—(Looks at his hand)—My hand is messed up.
 Chandler:I did. (Looks at his still deformed hand) But it came at a price.
 Chandler:Oh come on by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (They both look at him.) Was it just me?!
 Chandler:One more score to go! You can do it! (Touches her shoulder.)
 Chandler:All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
 Chandler:Are you are you high?
 Chandler:Really? I don’t like baths.
 Chandler:Honey it’s not the bath I enjoy it’s the wet naked lady.
 Chandler:Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
 Chandler:Honey it’s 200 on a Wednesday and I’m watching Road Rules how stressed do you think I am?
 Chandler:Oh! Uh yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
 Chandler:Oh my God what’s up?!
 Chandler:Oh no-no no you don’t just come back.
 Chandler:Do you?
 Chandler:In London?
 Chandler:Yes. When Monica and I were in London we were both in London.
 Chandler:If that.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Sex on the balcony?
 Chandler:What is it?
 Chandler:Honey I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
 Chandler:Well this does butch it up a bit.
 Chandler:All right if I do this can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
 Chandler:(thinking) All right this isn’t so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay because I’ve got my boat.
 Chandler:Oh my God.
 Chandler:I’m going to need a bigger boat.
 Chandler:I’m in the bathroom can you come in here? I think there’s something wrong.
 Chandler:I’m in the bathtub.
 Chandler:I drew my own bath but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The salt didn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’t compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!
 Chandler:The bath salts! They’re starting to effervesce! It’s different. (Pause) It’s interesting.
 Chandler:Yeah! Sure sure. So what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!
 Chandler:I had the exact same conversation.
 Chandler:I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!
 Chandler:All right let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
 Chandler:Uh-huh.
 Chandler:He didn’t say anything about that to me.
 Chandler:He was asking all these questions about you me and London. And of course the glue that holds this all together the rules.
 Chandler:But what did he mean by rules?
 Chandler:Because he was looking at her differently.
 Chandler:My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
 Chandler:You don’t say anything.
 Chandler:I’m not going to let you say anything.
 Chandler:Oh God!
 Chandler:Do I smell essential oils?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:L-leaving my troubles behind?
 Chandler:Oh it’s so hard to care when you’re this relaxed.
 Chandler:(upset) Hey!
 Chandler:(To Monica) You told her?!
 Chandler:(sarcastically) Because it’s a relaxing and enjoyable time!
 Chandler:You like Rachel?!
 Chandler:(sarcastically) Yes we’re all in here and we would love for you to join us!
 Chandler:I’ll…I’ll get you later!
 Chandler:Yeah. And what you’re doing feels so good.
 Chandler:You’re not?
 Chandler:Oh sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
 Chandler:Hey Pheebs what’s up?
 Chandler:Buy stamps pick up dry cleaning…Don’t let Phoebe in.
 Chandler:Well Phoebe I thought I’d—(Off Phoebe’s look)—Yeah what the hell. (Exits with Phoebe.)
 Chandler:Hey babe.
 Chandler:Who says you can’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
 Chandler:How about to the street say from the balcony?
 Chandler:Okay. How about in that cabinet?
 Chandler:How about the closet by the bathroom? (The secret green door by the bathroom.)
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no I will do it. Honey you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (Tries the door.) It’s locked you have to help me. Why is it locked?
 Chandler:Oh y’know I’ve been living here a while and I’ve never seen what’s inside that closet. What is what is in there?
 Chandler:Don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
 Chandler:Fine.
 Chandler:(walking casually away) Love you.
 Chandler:Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said If it helps! (Goes to the bedroom.)
 Chandler:I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I swear! (Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.)
 Chandler:Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’s in it.
 Chandler:I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can’t see?!
 Chandler:Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
 Chandler:And here we go…
 Chandler:There has got to be a way!
 Chandler:Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait I’m not an nine-year-old girl.
 Chandler:Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
 Chandler:So how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
 Chandler:That’s a good idea.
 Chandler:Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh Ross is kinda bummed huh?
 Chandler:Well it’s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y’know? You’re doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (He loses his card behind the door.) Richard? If-if you’re in there could you pass me my credit card?
 Chandler:Not to shabby I got this all off myself…using my wife’s tools. (He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see what’s behind the green door! It is stacked floor to ceiling with junk.) Oh my God!
 Chandler:(laughs) You’re messy.
 Chandler:I married Fred Sanford!
 Chandler:No honey you’re not sick! Look I don’t love you because you’re organized I love you in spite of that.
 Chandler:Yes! And look now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we can we share the closet.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
 Chandler:Are you okay?
 Chandler:Happy Valentine’s!
 Chandler:(picking up a video from the table) ‘Candy and Cookie’. ‘Candy and Cookie?’ Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!! (Chandler runs over to the TV puts the tape in and sits down to enjoy some porn)
 Chandler:I love you St. Valentine.
 Chandler:Woah woah that’s not pretty!
 Chandler:Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever! (Chandler starts to press buttons on the remote control frantically.)
 Chandler:I am trying!
 Chandler:(pointing at the video) Why did you get me this?
 Chandler:It’s yelling…bleeding…dilating. Oh the dilating…
 Chandler:I thought…maybe…you got me porn for Valentine’s Day.
 Chandler:Well I’m not really in a sexy mood right now.
 Chandler:Well remember the first time we saw Jaws?
 Chandler:How long it took to go back in the water?
 Chandler:You don’t know. You didn’t see it.
 Chandler:Oh beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful? (picks up the remote and presses a button and he immediately makes a face that just looks like he’s going to throw up!)
 Chandler:See honey there’s—(puts his hand on her leg)
 Chandler:90 seconds.
 Chandler:You know it haunts me? Up ‘til now the worst thing I ever saw was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this I would gladly make that my screensaver!
 Chandler:I can do that.
 Chandler:Okay. Now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair.
 Chandler:Oh I know!
 Chandler:Poor Ross.
 Chandler:Oh great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear but for this he closes the drapes!
 Chandler:Oh and we should warn you before you watch it don’t watch it.
 Chandler:Well let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
 Chandler:(with his arm all the way under the cushion moving it around) This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (Chandler puts the tape in and they all sit down) Okay here we go.
 Chandler:Why have I seen this thing three times?!
 Chandler:Wait you guys look!
 Chandler:No the baby’s out! Look look!
 Chandler:And look how happy the mom is now!
 Chandler:Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) She’s growing inside you.
 Chandler:Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)
 Chandler:I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.
 Chandler:Oh hey!
 Chandler:No. I mean I believe that uh certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love but soul mates I don’t think they exist.
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Come on don’t be crazy. (To Rachel) You don’t think there’s someone out there better suited for Monica than me do ya? (Rachel looks at him.)
 Chandler:A tall guy with hair similar to mine oh unknowable universe!
 Chandler:Luckily the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.
 Chandler:You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?
 Chandler:(mouths to Phoebe) What?
 Chandler:What’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.) On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still there’s staring.) No?
 Chandler:What are you doing?!
 Chandler:I believe in tall handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
 Chandler:Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work huh Don?
 Chandler:Cheese it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
 Chandler:Is it made of cheese?
 Chandler:(disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?
 Chandler:What do we do?
 Chandler:Sure why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here browsing through the personals.
 Chandler:Yeah fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
 Chandler:I’m sorry did you say cheese?
 Chandler:Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates and I don’t believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look I won’t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
 Chandler:No. But I’m sure (mimics Don) ‘tomatoes’ does.
 Chandler:You don’t?
 Chandler:So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?
 Chandler:I love you.
 Chandler:Y’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica doesn’t look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:I don’t see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?
 Chandler:What?! No! No!
 Chandler:(incredulous) I don’t know what that’s like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to I love you was Oh crap!
 Chandler:(interrupting him) We didn’t play it!!
 Chandler:I didn’t know you read tea leaves.
 Chandler:What does yours say Pheebs?
 Chandler:Well I’m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor’s.
 Chandler:Phoebe did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! (Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of The Village People what does that mean?
 Chandler:I know it’s tough now but things will get better.
 Chandler:I’m not great at the advice can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
 Chandler:Let’s just say if I can’t find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
 Chandler:In the James Taylor case.
 Chandler:Honey I’m gonna save you some time 200 CDs not one of them in the right case.
 Chandler:Well if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?
 Chandler:They were just giving those away at the store (off Monica’s look) in exchange for money.
 Chandler:Oh my God honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.
 Chandler:What problem did you tell him you had?
 Chandler:(singing) The sun’ll come out…tomorrow! Bet…your bottom dollar that tomorrow… (The girls start laughing and in a deep voice) …there’ll be sun.
 Chandler:You can always sell your baby.
 Chandler:Wow Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they’re not in the baby buying business.
 Chandler:Oh I’m sorry you’re kicking me out of my own living room?
 Chandler:I’ll be in there. (Goes into the bedroom.)
 Chandler:Oooh did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (Sits up) Who said that?
 Chandler:And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
 Chandler:What are you doing?
 Chandler:It’s a dog.
 Chandler:It’s your parents’ anniversary and you’re going to talk about their dead pet?
 Chandler:Yeah sure. What do you need? We got lace satin sateen raffia gingham felt (Pause) and I think my testacles may be in here too.
 Chandler:Ha!
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:I don’t think the flash went off.
 Chandler:Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
 Chandler:What are you doin’?
 Chandler:Ya know if you want to I can just hold them down and you could (Punches the air).
 Chandler:If only there was something in your head to control the things you say. (Joey nods his agreement.)
 Chandler:Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
 Chandler:No we’re just four people with neck problems. You talk like this. (Out of the sides of their mouths.)
 Chandler:Nice work my friend.
 Chandler:And a bagel with only…
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:Well I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
 Chandler:All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?
 Chandler:Y’know what we have to turn off the porn.
 Chandler:All right ready?
 Chandler:Two.
 Chandler:Yeah that’s kinda a relief.
 Chandler:You wanna see if we still have it?
 Chandler:FREE PORN!!!
 Chandler:We have free porn here!!!
 Chandler:What’s wrong with you?
 Chandler:This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you—Go to the doctor!
 Chandler:That’s still in there?!
 Chandler:Stick to your side!
 Chandler:Mento?
 Chandler:Thanks.
 Chandler:Well this one's for you.
 Chandler:No I can't. No-no listen I I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry (Puts bracelet on Joey) it's about you and me and the fact that we're (Reading bracelet) best buds.
 Chandler:That's what they'll call us.
 Chandler:It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
 Chandler:You’re turning into a woman.
 Chandler:Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?
 Chandler:Oh my God introduce us!
 Chandler:Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
 Chandler:That’s great.
 Chandler:You’ll be perfect for this! That’s already your name!
 Chandler:Okay I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
 Chandler:Bamboozled?
 Chandler:(simultaneously with Ross) No!
 Chandler:Well Joey I’m a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! (Waves.)
 Chandler:Bogota.
 Chandler:What does a Wicked Wango card do?
 Chandler:Higher or lower than what?
 Chandler:(To Ross) Can you believe how lame this is?
 Chandler:This is ridiculous he’s not gonna hold his breath… (Ross cuts him off by taking a deep breath and holding it.)
 Chandler:Let me see that.
 Chandler:Triscadecaphobia.
 Chandler:Fear of Triscuts?
 Chandler:This game makes no sense!
 Chandler:Oh come on Ross I think we’re all losers here.
 Chandler:Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.
 Chandler:Either it makes no difference.
 Chandler:I’ll take a card.
 Chandler:This game is kinda fun.
 Chandler:I don’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
 Chandler:Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
 Chandler:Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
 Chandler:I’d like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
 Chandler:Six!
 Chandler:(disappointed and simultaneously as Ross) Hungry monkey.
 Chandler:Tell it to the Time Turtle!
 Chandler:(annoyed) Oh come on!!
 Chandler:I’d like a Google Card.
 Chandler:Yes! (Pause) No! (Pause) Google!
 Chandler:Nooo!!
 Chandler:This is the best game ever!!!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:I’m so sorry.
 Chandler:I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
 Chandler:And people say you don’t pay attention. No this is a much better job. It’s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
 Chandler:That’s what I do now.
 Chandler:The front page? You really do live in your own little world don’t ya?
 Chandler:(entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!
 Chandler:Well I got a job interview. It’s kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I’d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
 Chandler:Me! I do that. So… Seriously do I look okay? I’m little nervous.
 Chandler:Why not?
 Chandler:What about it?
 Chandler:(shocked) What?!
 Chandler:Are you serious?!
 Chandler:What is it that I do?
 Chandler:(To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?
 Chandler:I can’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?
 Chandler:Oh good. Good because I’m sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.
 Chandler:An hour.
 Chandler:Phoebe!
 Chandler:Chandler Bing.
 Chandler:Well you should meet my uncle Bada. (Pause) I’ll let myself out.
 Chandler:…I think you’ll find if I come to work here I don’t micro-manage. I don’t shy away from delegating.
 Chandler:(suppressing a smile) What I do do…is manage to uh create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
 Chandler:Hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.
 Chandler:Oh! (Stands up.)
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:…also I was the point person on my company’s transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
 Chandler:That I did. That I did.
 Chandler:(nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right.
 Chandler:(trying not to laugh) I see.
 Chandler:(really try not to laugh) Good to know.
 Chandler:No don’t I beg of you!
 Chandler:(relieved) Really?!
 Chandler:Yeah I gotta say thank you I was really nervous. Y’know I’ve been told I come on to strong make to many jokes and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesn’t understand) Duties. (Still doesn’t.) Duties! (Still doesn’t.) Poo. (Still doesn’t.)
 Chandler:Oh my God this doesn’t count! Okay? The interview was over that was the real Chandler Bing in there this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There’s a crazy guy out in the hall!
 Chandler:I’ll look forward to your call. (Walks away.)
 Chandler:Let’s. (Everyone gets up and leaves Rachel.)
 Chandler:Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
 Chandler:He’s not snoozing he’s teaching a class.
 Chandler:I haven’t seen this dress.
 Chandler:You really want to take me?
 Chandler:So you’re never actually going to pay me back?
 Chandler:I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.
 Chandler:(in a manly voice) Yeah well I’m gonna go spit. (He goes into the bedroom. On his way out Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)
 Chandler:This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:It’s just so glamorous.
 Chandler:Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
 Chandler:Oh-ho-ho yeah!
 Chandler:The whole thing! Can we go?
 Chandler:I love the specifics the specifics were the best part!
 Chandler:I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
 Chandler:Don’t go! I’m sorry. I’m so sorry! (Sees another guy who is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! (Looks at him more closely.) Or call an ambulance.
 Chandler:Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
 Chandler:I’m so sorry.
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:You don’t owe me anything I don’t want you money…
 Chandler:I don’t know five hundred dollars?
 Chandler:Well then there was the second set the infamous booger head shots.
 Chandler:Do you want a calculator?
 Chandler:Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was right.)
 Chandler:Well uh there was acting classes stage combat classes tap classes…
 Chandler:Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
 Chandler:Yes money well spent!
 Chandler:Okay two three years of rent utilities food…
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:Man if only you’d gotten here sooner. (Ross turns and glares at him.)
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Okay. I’ve been thinking about it too and I I think we’re ready.
 Chandler:But you said you were ready too.
 Chandler:Yes but haven’t you wanted a kid like forever?
 Chandler:I’m not crazy about babies. I’m crazy about us.
 Chandler:Look we’ve always talked about having babies someday. I’m not saying it has to be right now but I’m starting to think that we can handle it. We’re good. We’re really good.
 Chandler:But nothing has to happen until your ready.
 Chandler:What?! It’s not right! We’re not ready to have a kid now!!
 Chandler:I’m kidding. This is going to be fun.
 Chandler:We’re trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing but Chandler stops it.) Y’know I’m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So when do you want to start trying?
 Chandler:Period math?
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Right here?
 Chandler:Wait a minute it’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we’re in a building that’s full of beds!
 Chandler:Okay. (They start kissing.)
 Chandler:Okay. Uh we’ll dim the lights dim the lights. (He goes to the light switch and finds it’s not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) Or turn them out all together. Uh no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. (He sprays an aerosol air freshener above her.)
 Chandler:Yes 98.6. You’re gonna be fine.
 Chandler:Should we tell Rachel there’s an empty private room right next door to hers?
 Chandler:Well let me think about that while I remove my pants!
 Chandler:If it’s not then there’s two of them. And that would mean it’s the end of the world!
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:Weirdest thing. Did I hear—(A nurse opens the privacy screen and Chandler sees Janice)—Mother of God it’s true!
 Chandler:Jan-Janice!
 Chandler:Janice I didn’t even know you were pregnant! Who’s the unwitting human who’s essence you’ve stolen?
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:That’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
 Chandler:It’s incredible I mean one minute she’s inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
 Chandler:So do you know what you’re gonna call her yet?
 Chandler:So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
 Chandler:You do?
 Chandler:Oh no it’s gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn’t it?
 Chandler:That was amazing.
 Chandler:And if not we got to do it on a bucket.
 Chandler:He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
 Chandler:Okay. Wow.
 Chandler:Sure.
 Chandler:That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
 Chandler:What?! Why does she think that?
 Chandler:Again what?!
 Chandler:As we all are at some point during the day.
 Chandler:Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
 Chandler:And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
 Chandler:Well what did she say?
 Chandler:Does Ross know?
 Chandler:Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.
 Chandler:If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
 Chandler:Honey we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
 Chandler:I’m so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay but no foreplay.
 Chandler:Hello sir you know Monica.
 Chandler:Look we can’t stay in here forever.
 Chandler:This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. Now let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)
 Chandler:I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there that wasn’t for fun.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why… (To Mr. Geller) Look I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.
 Chandler:That’s funny this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.
 Chandler:Seriously sir my brains? All over the wall.
 Chandler:You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?
 Chandler:Joey you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look like?!
 Chandler:Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
 Chandler:Okay look just do it gently.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Yea yea. (Pulls the balloon out of his mouth)
 Chandler:No no Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office (Pulls another balloon out of his mouth) Am I producing them?
 Chandler:Couldn’t sleep last night you know then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today the more I worried about it the more I couldn’t sleep.  Y’know? I was like if I fall asleep now I’ll get six hours sleep but if I fall asleep now I’ll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn’t fall asleep.
 Chandler:Hey what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
 Chandler:Walter (nods).
 Chandler:Yep.
 Chandler:(not knowing what he’s saying yes to) Yes.
 Chandler:(enters) Hey.
 Chandler:Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
 Chandler:Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
 Chandler:Umm you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
 Chandler:Okay you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
 Chandler:People who’ve never ever been to Paris.
 Chandler:We’re moving to Tulsa! (Makes a excited expression on his face)
 Chandler:Okay Ms. McKenna she kind of works above my boss she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there and I was sleeping and apparently said yes.
 Chandler:The Sooner State whatever that is.
 Chandler:Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning!  Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
 Chandler:No no but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. (Monica’s not impressed.) I’ll get out of it.
 Chandler:(hears Emma crying) What is wrong with Emma?
 Chandler:Umm ma’am do you have a minute? (She points for him to come in) I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa.
 Chandler:It’s a funny story actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa I didn’t really know what I was saying.
 Chandler:But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting ain’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan alright (he sits down). See here’s the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. See me I love Tulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go there!
 Chandler:No no no! Look Carol can I call you Carol? (Pause) Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son strapping! (She glares at him.) That’s a picture of your daughter isn’t it well she’s lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I’ll call you from Tulsa. (Exits.)
 Chandler:(entering loudly) Hey!
 Chandler:Oh so there can’t be any yelling.
 Chandler:We’re moving to Tulsa
 Chandler:Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! (Walks backwards towards the door) I can’t I can’t hear you. (He runs out)
 Chandler:(enters) Hey what you guys talking about?
 Chandler:Okay our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa  so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.
 Chandler:They said it could be up to a year.
 Chandler:There is nothing like the support of your loving wife huh?
 Chandler:I'm sorry buddy but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:(Enters) Hey!
 Chandler:I've got good news!
 Chandler:Okay I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.
 Chandler:I'm sorry are you just used to saying that?
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
 Chandler:Hey you said that without gagging!
 Chandler:I know what she's talking about.
 Chandler:He saw a therapist?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
 Chandler:Slim Pickings.
 Chandler:No 'Slim Pickings' it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
 Chandler:'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
 Chandler:Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
 Chandler:Honey we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:How far outside?
 Chandler:And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before you said being me with me was more important than any job but I guess now it's old job (Raises his hand) me (Raises his hand) new job.
 Chandler:What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
 Chandler:I think you should take the job.
 Chandler:Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
 Chandler:Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
 Chandler:Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
 Chandler:That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
 Chandler:Well you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy. (They hug)
 Chandler:Of course I will call you. I love you.
 Chandler:Awww. (They hug) Bye!
 Chandler:(Tries to hug Joey but J. moves away) What's the matter Joe?
 Chandler:Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
 Chandler:Well bye Mon bye Ross Rachel bye Emma!
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:I know that too. (They kiss)
 Chandler:(On cell phone) Don't worry I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know that's how. I promise.
 Chandler:(enters singing) Oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plane STOP IT! Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas? 7 o clock maybe I'll hit the gym (sits down) who am I kidding pay-per-view porn.
 Chandler:DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica (smiles)
 Chandler:everything's great just watching some regular television there what a pleasant surprise. (She hugs him and she knows what he was doing so she looks at the TV and sees sharks swimming around thinking Chandler was giving himself a treat to sharks.)
 Chandler:Ok honey. that was close.
 Chandler:Hi honey I'm home!
 Chandler:oh it was great.
 Chandler:well well well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!
 Chandler:(Chandler looking confused) Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.
 Chandler:no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
 Chandler:does what always have to be sharks.
 Chandler:What's going on?
 Chandler:let ME be a part of this!
 Chandler:no they don't
 Chandler:OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel I was just watching regular porn
 Chandler:yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.
 Chandler:You are an amazing wife. (Monica shrugs) No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.
 Chandler:Good morning everyone it�s nice to see our team together for the first time. Now before we get started are there any questions? (colleague raises hand) Yes Ken is it?
 Chandler:(laughs) Well don�t believe everything you hear Ken. (both turning away to files) But yeah that�s true. Alright let�s get started by take a look at last quarter�s figures. (The female next to Chandler starts smoking towards her) Ah Claudia aren�t you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses� ass?
 Chandler:No no no-no-no. I smoked for years then I quit. Right now I can�t remember why. (to everyone) You�re not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?
 Chandler:Alright lo�look. I don�t smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up go ahead it�s fine. (everyone lights up) So you all smoke then? That�s almost rude that I�m not.
 Chandler:(loud) Ken please! No I can�t I can�t smoke. If I smoke my wife would kill me.
 Chandler:I always liked you Ken. (takes a cigarette)
 Chandler:Actually in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
 Chandler:No! I just happened t�do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.
 Chandler:Uch do you think Monica is gonna be able smell it?
 Chandler:Pheebs?
 Chandler:(getting in) Okay something to cover the smell � Oven cleaner! (sprays himself reads label) Unscented!
 Chandler:No thanks I�m good.
 Chandler:(shrinks back) Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane so I�m feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
 Chandler:(still backs away) Alright the truth is I soiled myself during some turbulences.
 Chandler:Yes but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay five. A pack. Two pack�a�a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. (How many cigarettes are there in one pack and how many packs in one carton in the US?) But it�s over I made a decision I�m not gonna smoke anymore.
 Chandler:But those are for you.
 Chandler:I messed up it was a meeting everybody was smoking.
 Chandler:Will power? I�ve watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs (?) without taking the tin foil off.
 Chandler:�kay look Can we just drop this? I�m not gonna smoke again.
 Chandler:You forbid me?
 Chandler:You know I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?
 Chandler:Oh would you say this was the most upset you could be?
 Chandler:Then I might as well � (grabs the cigarettes) do this (lights one exhales). Not really sure what to do now.
 Chandler:Fine. What!?
 Chandler:You serious? (follows)
 Chandler:Right fine I�ll do it but no talking.
 Chandler:And no kissing your neck.
 Chandler:And lots of kissing your neck.
 Chandler:Look I can�t do this. I can�t make luv to you while we�re fighting this way.
 Chandler:That was a celebration of life. Alright look I�m not gonna do this. Alright is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
 Chandler:Mean it?
 Chandler:You are incredible. Unless I�I�m not gonna smoke again. And if I do I promise I will hide it so much better from you. (they kiss)
 Chandler:Yeah let�s celebrate life!
 Chandler:Uhh. You are welcome.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes�no big deal.
 Chandler:Leave it.
 Chandler:You tricked me to get me into bed?
 Chandler:I feel so used.
 Chandler:I would never lie to get someone into bed.
 Chandler:I suppose that Monica will have the � manipulative shrew.
 Chandler:You mean the lully story?
 Chandler:Oh yeah that�s what she says. But maybe you�re not ovulating at all maybe it�s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
 Chandler:(to Joey) You not gonna believe this She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.
 Chandler:What�s the matter with me? Why I�m such a girl?
 Chandler:So you never had sex with a Kennedy have you?
 Chandler:(picking up the telephone answering it with a frog in his throat) Hello? (he clears his throat but he still has the same frog in his throat when he speaks again) Hello?
 Chandler:Honey you're screaming.
 Chandler:(yawning) Oh that's great.
 Chandler:(clearly not so interested) Awesome.
 Chandler:(angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) I'm funny right...? What do you know you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... (laughs about himself but then gets determined again) Save it for inside! (he enters)
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica looks at Phoebe who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah I'm from the waistband Wyoming. But when I was seven we headed over to the crotch.
 Chandler:(laughs but then moves to Phoebe) And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
 Chandler:What's with the word y'all? You know just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that because if so I say why stop there? You know your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter waiter excuse me I'll have the fricken? (Monica laughs) See that's... that's funny with the fricken right?
 Chandler:Yeah he came up...
 Chandler:(to Phoebe) Were you there?
 Chandler:Hey! (Joey doesn't look up but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later when Monica is around I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
 Chandler:(Can't believe what he hears) Well thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.
 Chandler:Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
 Chandler:Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just said and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:What are you guys talking about?
 Chandler:You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? (Monica starts laughing but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh but very fake. Chandler seems happy again.)
 Chandler:You know I don't mind a... male nanny but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh even more fake than before)
 Chandler:If I'd known you guys were coming over I would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)
 Chandler:What is so funny about that? (they realise it wasn't a joke)
 Chandler:Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts laughing hysterically but then gets serious again...)
 Chandler:So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and Ross walk away from the kitchen)
 Chandler:Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
 Chandler:I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler whose wife made him die inside.
 Chandler:Well I'm off to Tulsa so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
 Chandler:Really...? See... that's the thing you gotta keep it smart people!
 Chandler:I love you too. (Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns to Joey.) And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the back.)
 Chandler:See ya! (he leaves the apartment)
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:How come?
 Chandler:Do you have any ideas?
 Chandler:(imitating Monica) Oh and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
 Chandler:Oh well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
 Chandler:So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
 Chandler:mmm That's enough about you!
 Chandler:No no no no no NO! No no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.
 Chandler:We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! (laughs) You don't think he's here do you? (Joey looks around)
 Chandler:(Chandler looks around the place and his eye gets caught by Richard's video collection) Look at these videos. You know I mean who does he think he is? Magnum Force Dirty Harry Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!
 Chandler:There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
 Chandler:Get there faster! (Joey gasps and finally understands...)
 Chandler:I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean what good could possibly come from watching? (sighs) Well we know I'm gonna watch it. (Chandler moves to put the tape in the VCR and Joey enters the apartment)
 Chandler:Don't judge me I'm only human!
 Chandler:I had to! Okay imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?
 Chandler:Some girl...!?
 Chandler:Yeah...!?
 Chandler:Allright I'm gonna watch it... I mean look it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... (laughs nervously) Can it?
 Chandler:Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
 Chandler:Just for a few seconds so I can know what it is... Please?
 Chandler:Why am I hearing cheering?
 Chandler:Football? Just football?
 Chandler:It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer... (Chandler walks to the fridge his back turned to the TV and a moaning sound replaces the cheering of the crowd... Joey's eyes double in size...) What the... (Chandler turns around but Joey already took a sprint for Chandler jumps and floors Chandler in the open space in front of the apartment door...) What are you doing?
 Chandler:Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
 Chandler:Because that's who I am okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.
 Chandler:This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
 Chandler:Oh yeah well poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!
 Chandler:Yeah oh but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
 Chandler:Oh good good. Play more 'cause I wanna see how it ends.
 Chandler:What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
 Chandler:Is that a problem?
 Chandler:Yeah. Hey here's an idea why don't we use our wedding china today?
 Chandler:Honey she keeps canceling on us take the hint.
 Chandler:What is the point of having them if we never use them?
 Chandler:I will explain it to her.
 Chandler:Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!
 Chandler:Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?
 Chandler:What are you going to do?
 Chandler:Well you proved them wrong.
 Chandler:I'll tell you what for the rest of our lives I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:Oh suddenly flowers are feminine?
 Chandler:I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
 Chandler:You know guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>
 Chandler:No if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma Right?
 Chandler:Actually what?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:So if Monica's not around then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
 Chandler:Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
 Chandler:Look I may not know a lot about babies but do you really think I'm not capable?
 Chandler:Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up.
 Chandler:So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die I get Emma. Then my wife dies then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?
 Chandler:Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
 Chandler:Yeah but they're right. I mean I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.
 Chandler:Yeah but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.
 Chandler:Oh yeah well can you picture me saying Go to your room! You're grounded?
 Chandler:You said that to me last week.
 Chandler:Oh no thats okay you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die you don't get Joey.
 Chandler:Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.
 Chandler:Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.
 Chandler:By the way that fight was totally arousing.
 Chandler:Oh yeah? Well thanks.
 Chandler:Okay but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.
 Chandler:Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> Well.. what do you know? I guess I'll be the one who dies first.
 Chandler:Nope...
 Chandler:Yep...
 Chandler:Nope... (Monica walks in) Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know I think you were right I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
 Chandler:Maybe not even then. (Joey walks in)
 Chandler:(coming from the bedroom) Say goodbye elves I'm off to Tulsa.
 Chandler:Yeah we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done I'll be fired.
 Chandler:So who does?
 Chandler:I'm sorry I won't be here.
 Chandler:Thanks. (they kiss) I'll see you New Year's Day.
 Chandler:Did I not mention that?
 Chandler:(thinks for a second then waves his arms exclaiming) AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! (and runs out of the apartment)
 Chandler:All right everybody I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families but there's *no* call (he takes it off) for writing Screw you Mr. Bing! on the back of my chair! (he looks at it) -- By the way you can all call me Chandler.
 Chandler:Hey. Where've you been?
 Chandler:(to the others) You hear that? You may not be with your families but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.
 Chandler:Y'know what I know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) I had a little talk with the boys in New York told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.
 Chandler:Well that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!
 Chandler:I'm sorry. Hey at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses wich by the way none of you have invited me to.
 Chandler:Haha no thanks!
 Chandler:Oh thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
 Chandler:Typical Christmas-y stuff you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...
 Chandler:I can save you time ladies I'm right here.
 Chandler:What? That's terrible!
 Chandler:Oh well that that makes it not terrible.
 Chandler:No not okay you can't look for Monica's presents!
 Chandler:No you don't have to and you can't because I I live here too.
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:No I have a great idea for a present for her.
 Chandler:If I help we can find 'em faster!
 Chandler:OK Pheebs your turn.
 Chandler:And a lemon lime.
 Chandler:And last but not least.
 Chandler:(entering in a Santa costume) Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!
 Chandler:Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
 Chandler:Well I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here weird...turtle-man?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
 Chandler:Fine I'll give the suit back.
 Chandler:Santa? Really?
 Chandler:Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
 Chandler:Then it's okaaay! (They kiss.)
 Chandler:You know what everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.
 Chandler:Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright look go! Go home okay? Merry Christmas! Go.
 Chandler:Good God's speed good people! (he starts to close the door turns around and sees Wendy) You're not gonna go?
 Chandler:Ah. Thanks.
 Chandler:Ah. (The phone rings; he answers it) Chandler Bing.
 Chandler:Ahh Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
 Chandler:Ah well no it's just uh me and Wendy.
 Chandler:It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
 Chandler:I sent them home.
 Chandler:Uhh uh...
 Chandler:I don't know!
 Chandler:I don't think of her that way you know she's a she's a colleague.
 Chandler:Oh she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
 Chandler:BE-LOW me!
 Chandler:Well she... she didn't win...
 Chandler:Well second prettiest that year; I mean of *all* the girls in Oklahoma she's probably...
 Chandler:Honey there's really nothing to worry about.
 Chandler:I'm serious!
 Chandler:Merry Christmas.
 Chandler:Merry Christmas you guys!
 Chandler:(hanging up the phone) The wife says Hi!.
 Chandler:Ah well she's got this weird idea that uh y'know just because you and I are alone that something is gonna happen.
 Chandler:This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
 Chandler:Whoa-ho back off Missy! (He takes a step back but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)
 Chandler:I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... (She lets go of his tie) Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
 Chandler:(flattered) No... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several steps away from her.) Look I'm I'm married!
 Chandler:I'm *happily* married.
 Chandler:Right. So I'm sorry...
 Chandler:Well look it's not easy to spend this much time apart you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or in this case right on money! ... You know she's amazing and beautiful and smart and if she were here right now ...she'd kick your ass. Look you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But what I have with my wife is pretty great so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
 Chandler:I mean you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
 Chandler:You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
 Chandler:But we don't do that.
 Chandler:How drunk are you?
 Chandler:(thinks) That's the perfect amount!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:Well I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
 Chandler:Yep!
 Chandler:Count of three?
 Chandler:Two!
 Chandler:Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
 Chandler:Eh! (They start making out again)
 Chandler:So are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
 Chandler:Y'know I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well I have and the technical definition is two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me then we have to y'know get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.
 Chandler:Really? Okay so...
 Chandler:Y'know I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
 Chandler:Right!
 Chandler:Okay all right all right all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay here's something here's something blue and new.
 Chandler:Let's go! (Starts to leave.)
 Chandler:Oh okay I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
 Chandler:I don't think so.
 Chandler:(looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the sweater.)
 Chandler:No we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
 Chandler:Okay one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)
 Chandler:Ehh.
 Chandler:Look I thought about it too and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
 Chandler:Yeah I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then then that's what we're gonna do.
 Chandler:Eh forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Uh four a boy twin girls and another boy.
 Chandler:Well stuff like where we'd live y'know? Like a small place outside the city where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
 Chandler:Sure you do.
 Chandler:You sure?
 Chandler:I love you so much.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
 Chandler:Monica.
 Chandler:I never want to leave you again!
 Chandler:Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
 Chandler:Yeah! It's a stupid job and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
 Chandler:(realizing) I have *not* thought this through!
 Chandler:I know I I should have talked to you first about it.
 Chandler:Thanks!
 Chandler:(flattered) Ahh...
 Chandler:(to Monica) Here pass these will ya.. (points to the others)
 Chandler:I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides this gift still says I love you guys.
 Chandler:I don't have a *job*!
 Chandler:Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks down on himself checking then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to Monica) Hey d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
 Chandler:I mean what am I supposed to do with myself? 
 Chandler:But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start. 
 Chandler:Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
 Chandler:How long was I in there?
 Chandler:Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
 Chandler:I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time though.
 Chandler:I mean I can write slogans. I mean how hard can it be right? Cheese. It's milk that you chew. Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy. A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?
 Chandler:Honey? Leave it to the pros.
 Chandler:The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones.
 Chandler:No no. But let me show you what I can do. Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood.
 Chandler:Really? That's great!
 Chandler:It's funny. When you said unpaid it sounded like you said unpaid.
 Chandler:Actually we're trying and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.
 Chandler:Whatever I decide to do I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.
 Chandler:Yeah. 
 Chandler:Yeah Ross is here so...
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.
 Chandler:Oh god I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant. 
 Chandler:That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
 Chandler:Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises. 
 Chandler:That's actually why. Look I'm starting a whole new career now and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
 Chandler:Or a year?
 Chandler:It could be less than a year. I mean you've heard my stuff. Pants. Like shorts but longer. (Pause) It'll probably be more than a year. 
 Chandler:Yeah me too. Look I'll just get my old job back. 
 Chandler:I quit and you learn what I do?
 Chandler:I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby. 
 Chandler:Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
 Chandler:Oh and I promise I will not fake it this time.
 Chandler:Hey
 Chandler:Oh she's at home putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
 Chandler:I tried but apparantly singing I will survive in a helium voice - not helping.
 Chandler:Yes Bravo on the hot nanny.
 Chandler:Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
 Chandler:Now that Rachel's gone?
 Chandler:I wasn't staring. I was leering.
 Chandler:Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
 Chandler:Seriously dude 3 years ago.
 Chandler:You don't trust him?
 Chandler:Is this really your long term plan for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
 Chandler:Allright fine but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something more often than not he's going to have sex with it.
 Chandler:Picturing that tree?
 Chandler:Where you going Joe?
 Chandler:Oh. You mind if I join you?
 Chandler:Your thoughts? Plural?
 Chandler:I'm afraid I can't let you do that Joe.
 Chandler:Yes as a matter of fact he did so I can't let you go.
 Chandler:Great novels?
 Chandler:(In a helium voice holding a balloon) I'm sorry I got a little occupied.
 Chandler:(still helium voice) Right behind you big guy! (they both head for the door)
 Chandler:(sings in a helium voice) First I was afraid I was petrified (very happy)
 Chandler:(normal voice) Hi
 Chandler:Oh well someone left this (shows a green jacket). This is yours?
 Chandler:Oh uh well I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said
 Chandler:So are you gonna...talk to her?
 Chandler:You know when That's fine sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
 Chandler:No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
 Chandler:Dude don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
 Chandler:Why did I get married?!
 Chandler:Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
 Chandler:Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male divorced three times
 Chandler:What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
 Chandler:Maybe she didn't move on you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing
 Chandler:Did she go out with him?
 Chandler:Ah! The high road...
 Chandler:Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
 Chandler:I thought I had to make the jokes!
 Chandler:Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler here's my friend Ross right here and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. 
 Chandler:We still got it!
 Chandler:I don't get it neither I mean you're obviously desperate you're asking women how they want to be killed
 Chandler:By drowning or...?!
 Chandler:Well...
 Chandler:Wow it seems serious. What seems to be the problem Ashley Judd?
 Chandler:I am sorry moment to make fun of that please!
 Chandler:It�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
 Chandler:Ok. First of all this is green!
 Chandler:All right I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
 Chandler:Ok you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage well I earned mine
 Chandler:Yeah well I guess you don�t need my help Victor Victoria!
 Chandler:Oh not with my combination of ice cubes aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
 Chandler:And done!
 Chandler:Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
 Chandler:Yeah yeah I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about
 Chandler:No problem.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:I am sorry I am late. You�ll understand when you�ll see Joey.
 Chandler:Really? In front of all this people?
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Are those my wife�s nipples?
 Chandler:I gotta stop this.
 Chandler:You touching yourself out!
 Chandler:�Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine never understood a single word he said but I helped him
 Chandler:See now why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip happening people. Now if you'll excuse me I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
 Chandler:Wow.
 Chandler:Well I think it's great that you're going on a date you know? I mean it sounds healthy. I mean you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
 Chandler:Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
 Chandler:No no no no! No no no no! It's okay it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
 Chandler:I don't do that.
 Chandler:I'll try to stop. Wait did you say until the sixth?
 Chandler:Today is the sixth.
 Chandler:Yes it's also 2003.
 Chandler:It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
 Chandler:Tough crib.
 Chandler:I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
 Chandler:I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
 Chandler:Oh good because as of four o'clock this afternoon I am not.
 Chandler:I - I don't think I can.
 Chandler:Because of Emma.
 Chandler:Sorry.
 Chandler:Well she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
 Chandler:Well I can't say hump or screw in front of the B-A-B-Y.
 Chandler:Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
 Chandler:You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
 Chandler:Emma was doing it!
 Chandler:Ooh she's asleep that means we can...
 Chandler:I think we may have really done it this time.
 Chandler:You may wanna get some more of those too.
 Chandler:Where's Emma?
 Chandler:Don't ask me I was in there canoodling you!
 Chandler:Okay. (Runs out.)
 Chandler:All right all right we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.
 Chandler:No no no.
 Chandler:What? Why?
 Chandler:Your family name is Tribbiani.
 Chandler:(excited) Guys guys I've got great news! Guess what…
 Chandler:Thank you. I got a job in advertising. (Everybody cheers)
 Chandler:Actually it pays nothing. It's an internship.
 Chandler:Right. So it'll be the same except… less sex with you. (Joey nods)
 Chandler:Well it's a training program but at the end they hire the people they like.
 Chandler:Yeah I mean there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink you know grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating 
 Chandler:(grinning awkwardly) Humiliating and noble!
 Chandler:(entering) Good morning everybody.
 Chandler:Oh no no I'm an intern just like you guys… except for the tie the briefcase… and the fact that I can rent a car.
 Chandler:Yeah well I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and you know you gotta start at the bottom.
 Chandler:Right. Look I know I'm a little bit older than you guys but it's not like I'm Bob Hope (he sits down) 
 Chandler:The comedian? USO?!
 Chandler:(entering carrying a large box) Honey I'm old!
 Chandler:I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
 Chandler:Yes but I don't think life experience with these. (He opens the box and takes an inline skate-like sneaker out)
 Chandler:They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
 Chandler:What am I supposed to do with these?
 Chandler:Well first of all they're not called sneakers anymore. Apparently they're called kicks or skids and I think I heard somebody say slorps. (He takes a sneaker) And here look they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause apparently walking is too much exercise. Kids kids roll your way to childhood obesity! (to Monica) Would you help me try to sell these?
 Chandler:No I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for. 
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Putting on the sneakers… thought I'd get into a younger mindset you know to see if it sparked anything…
 Chandler:Yes how's this They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!
 Chandler:(sitting on the couch) You know what… these aren't half-bad! (to Rachel) You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
 Chandler:Alright (He stands wearing the sneakers on) I feel youger already! 
 Chandler:(on the floor) Yah I think I broke my hip.
 Chandler:Okay… (He stands up) You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age…
 Chandler:A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. Just then a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs and the line reads Not suitable for adults! 
 Chandler:Oh thank you sir… or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me (He sits down again)
 Chandler:(over-enthusiastic) I don't know I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset you know and it just started to flow.
 Chandler:The cold weather hurts my hip!
 Chandler:Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
 Chandler:I'm not sure what they did but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
 Chandler:Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
 Chandler:You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
 Chandler:No! We're not borrowing money.
 Chandler:Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
 Chandler:That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
 Chandler:Yeah.... she's not so cute.
 Chandler:Yes dear.
 Chandler:Hey Joe!
 Chandler:Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
 Chandler:And that would have made the official party line. (Joey nods) Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
 Chandler:What? What do you mean you know?
 Chandler:Oh! Right.
 Chandler:Anyway err... I need to borrow some money.
 Chandler:Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! (Joey begins writing a cheque)
 Chandler:Oh ok.
 Chandler:I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
 Chandler:Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
 Chandler:Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
 Chandler:No no! I just love the way you look I am warm for your form.
 Chandler:Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
 Chandler:I mean You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
 Chandler:Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. (kisses monica) Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:But honey you don't have to.
 Chandler:Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
 Chandler:your ass?!?!?
 Chandler:They...do that?
 Chandler:God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
 Chandler:Alright look if it means that much to you a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
 Chandler:(sedated) What?
 Chandler:Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs manueveored a narrow hallway dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
 Chandler:Aaaaand....... hernia.
 Chandler:Ah look on the bright side I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you. (they hug again)
 Chandler:Hey! Ready to go?
 Chandler:What are you doin'?
 Chandler:Great a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
 Chandler:The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
 Chandler:Bet she'd sleep with you now...
 Chandler:Let me see what you wrote about yourself Doctor Paleontology two kids...  (pause) You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!
 Chandler:Maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on Ross' computer) Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had... aaand SEND!
 Chandler:Oh I'm so sorry!
 Chandler:You're not gonna need my help?
 Chandler:Oh good 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)
 Chandler:I believe I read that somewhere!
 Chandler:I respectfully disagree.
 Chandler:Who cares? Nobody reads those things
 Chandler:I don't have a page.
 Chandler:Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
 Chandler:Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
 Chandler:Hang up hang up. And that was a great movie! (Monica hangs up) I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah this will show him here we go (starts typing something).
 Chandler:Oh you'll see my friend.
 Chandler:(faking sympathy) And so young.
 Chandler:Well how you died was funny.
 Chandler:It kills over one americans every year.
 Chandler:You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
 Chandler:Hey Ross I just wanted to apologize... (­looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
 Chandler:Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
 Chandler:No come on you know that's not true.
 Chandler:Well the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
 Chandler:Alright look let's think about this ok do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
 Chandler:Right I mean come on I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service tons of people would come.
 Chandler:Ross what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
 Chandler:Ross don't press send don't press se... !
 Chandler:There you go! Someone came!
 Chandler:(in a mournful voice) Please come in.
 Chandler:Oh yes yes... let me... take your coat.
 Chandler:At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)
 Chandler:Some guy Tom Gordon.
 Chandler:(entering very upset) Ok Tommy that's enough mourning for you! Here we go bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)
 Chandler:Ok! (shuts the door behind Tom)
 Chandler:Please one ridiculous problem at a time!
 Chandler:You gave them one day's notice not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
 Chandler:Oh that's not true. You had an impact on me I mean it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
 Chandler:I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now go hide. (Ross hides in the bedroom again)
 Chandler:Kori? Kori Weston?
 Chandler:Wow! You look amazing!
 Chandler:Chandler Chandler Bing. I'm not gay I'm not gay at all.
 Chandler:Don't listen to him he's in a really bad mood! (lets her in)
 Chandler:I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
 Chandler:I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
 Chandler:Yeah because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!
 Chandler:Still on Amelia Earhart?
 Chandler:Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
 Chandler:(looking around at the others)I'll ask. (To Ross) Boohaki?
 Chandler:Kinda like Joey.
 Chandler:Pie eating contest?
 Chandler:No I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
 Chandler:(hysterical)Don't touch the phone! I'll get it I'll get it I'll get it!! (picks up the phone)
 Chandler:(into receiver)Hello? Hey Charlie what do you know?
 Chandler:(still on the phone)Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.
 Chandler:One of the slots got filled.
 Chandler:Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
 Chandler:Yeah I know.
 Chandler:Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean I wanna get one I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.
 Chandler:I can see the headline now Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm.
 Chandler:Well you wouldn't but we own the paper we can print whatever we want.
 Chandler:Ok so now that you're in what are you gonna do if we win?
 Chandler:Ooh! Calm down ...
 Chandler:You know I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
 Chandler:You're right it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
 Chandler:(looks around) I'll take this one too (to Ross) Uh ... Mommy?
 Chandler:Hello? Hello? Oh hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man I would have slept with him!! .. Alright bye. (hangs up)
 Chandler:Well no Charlie's gonna get that.
 Chandler:He's the boss's son.
 Chandler:What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
 Chandler:Yes there are I just saw them a few minutes ago.
 Chandler:Honey there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
 Chandler:(to Mon) She's right you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...
 Chandler:Let me finish ... (to everyone else) however it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles so screw you the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets from Rachel)
 Chandler:Oh yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
 Chandler:Can I come a little bit closer valuable things are getting squished...
 Chandler:(looking at the answering machine) Hey there's two messages. These could be from work!
 Chandler:Ok here we go! (he pushes the play button)
 Chandler:This is..shhh!
 Chandler:Oh is she related to Ralph Lauren?
 Chandler:Yeah you know I really thought I deserved it. (pause) But... let's go win the lottery... I mean we still have 130 chances to win right?
 Chandler:I got that!
 Chandler:No.
 Chandler:Ah the I'm sorry I rejected you phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. (on the phone getting up from the sofa) Hey Steve.
 Chandler:Oh no no no no I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones getting coffee I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts boobies butt cracks!
 Chandler:Me that guy who just said butt cracks?
 Chandler:Ok well thanks you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow (hangs up).
 Chandler:What? (pause) Oh yeah I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
 Chandler:Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
 Chandler:Thanks man.
 Chandler:Really? What?
 Chandler:(smiling surprised) Oh yeah? (looks towards the kitchen worried) Listen don't tell Monica she'll rip your heart right out.
 Chandler:Wow you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.
 Chandler:Me too.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
 Chandler:What? No I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont (shows them a brochure)!
 Chandler:So what do you say? Can you get out of work?
 Chandler:Are you really that busy?
 Chandler:Oh that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. (on the phone) Hi this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it (pause) Oh what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? (pause) Oh can't you make an exception?
 Chandler:(on the phone) Look this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok? (pause) Oh thank you very much! (hangs up) Yeah I'm going to Vermont...
 Chandler:I don't have travel insurance.
 Chandler:Hi Chandler Bing I have a reservation.
 Chandler:New York.
 Chandler:I'm sorry he's a little bit wound up we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
 Chandler:Well that's impossible can you check again please?
 Chandler:Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
 Chandler:Just give us the cheapest room you have.
 Chandler:That's insane!
 Chandler:Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? (pause) We'll take it.
 Chandler:(aside to Ross) What!? They are totally ripping us off!
 Chandler:Great at a hundred dollars an apple we're there!
 Chandler:Dude you're shaking!
 Chandler:USA Today
 Chandler:And I also got... two more apples.
 Chandler:I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
 Chandler:I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh you already got that.
 Chandler:Ok how about this (picks up the remote control)?
 Chandler:Yes but the batteries...
 Chandler:Thank you thank you very much!
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:Oh we did and you still have all your lamps.
 Chandler:Oh I didn't factor in the room tax.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Look we have enough just walk away.
 Chandler:There's a forest right outside.
 Chandler:Ok go quick!
 Chandler:I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table)
 Chandler:(browsing through a diary) Well let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes falling asleep in front of the TV.
 Chandler:I could fall asleep at a play.
 Chandler:(browsing through a diary) Uh let's see who do I hate?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Yes but Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
 Chandler:(to Monica) No I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
 Chandler:Where the hell is everybody?
 Chandler:(To himself) oh yes God yes!!
 Chandler:I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
 Chandler:(to Monica) So how did you enjoy the play?
 Chandler:Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
 Chandler:Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it but why wouldn't I because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16 fat single and ready to mingle I was uplifted.
 Chandler:Oh yeah I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me tell me about your first period!
 Chandler:Did somebody sign your bra?
 Chandler:Oh well this was a really important experience for me and I wanted to share it with you.
 Chandler:Can't believe you guys bought that enjoy your slow death (runs away).
 Chandler:I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl right?
 Chandler:(to Joey) So a professor uh?
 Chandler:Oh yeah?
 Chandler:Oh well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it)
 Chandler:We really need to take those tests?
 Chandler:But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
 Chandler:It's weird! In a doctor's office?
 Chandler:(embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause) And in my defense it was a Wendy's!
 Chandler:Yeah ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
 Chandler:Oh yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
 Chandler:I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
 Chandler:Deposit my specimen? You know usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks got it.
 Chandler:Yeah I guess!
 Chandler:Oh Come on!
 Chandler:Why are you here?
 Chandler:(to Heaven) No no no... I mean why? why is she here??
 Chandler:What!?
 Chandler:I'd love to stay but I have eh... (points at the cup) got a hot date... (starts to leave)
 Chandler:(disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves)
 Chandler:(To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?
 Chandler:Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
 Chandler:I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
 Chandler:(Slightly panicky) Yeah but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?
 Chandler:(smiling again) oh oh yeah ok thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...
 Chandler:(stares at her intently then yells) It was a Wendy's!! 
 Chandler:(picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
 Chandler:Hello? Oh hi Doctor Connelly. (pause) No she's not here but you know I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well so what does that mean? (pause) Ok. Ok thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)
 Chandler:Doctor Connelly just called.
 Chandler:Actually it's both of us.
 Chandler:Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
 Chandler:It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It means...
 Chandler:(seriously) It means that we can keep trying but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
 Chandler:I'm sorry.
 Chandler:Well we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
 Chandler:(looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
 Chandler:Oh I can't believe my sperm have low motility because let me tell you when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:Oh DAMN IT!
 Chandler:Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (Dr. Connelly glares at him) Wow talking about an inhospitable environment!
 Chandler:(entering) Hey guys!
 Chandler:I think I can safely say that we all have family issues work stuff and/or are sick.
 Chandler:But you come first!
 Chandler:(sitting down on the couch) Ok.
 Chandler:Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
 Chandler:Well... there's surrogacy but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination so... we're talking about sperm donors.
 Chandler:(stopping Joey) ah-ha!
 Chandler:I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
 Chandler:Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner this is Zack from work!
 Chandler:You guys haven't actually met before but boy! You're both polite! (pause) Go to have a seat Zack and I'll get you a beer.
 Chandler:(to Mon) So Zack's pretty nice uh?
 Chandler:So how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
 Chandler:Well we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean look he's intelligent he's healthy he's athletic I mean he is spermtastic!
 Chandler:No I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy get to check him out.
 Chandler:I'm telling you he's great! I mean even if my sperm worked fine I'd think he'd be the way to go!
 Chandler:Ok!
 Chandler:(bringing the beer to Zack) Zack!
 Chandler:So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes those cheeckbones!
 Chandler:You don't like him.
 Chandler:Alright! Just follow my lead!
 Chandler:Oh! Thanks I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
 Chandler:(very seriously) That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
 Chandler:You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness (Monica stretches her neck to look behind Zack's head and then gives Chandler an ok sign)
 Chandler:I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
 Chandler:(Proceeding with his dinner) We're teeth people Zack!
 Chandler:You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
 Chandler:Are you just tired now or are you always tired 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
 Chandler:Ok.
 Chandler:I think we've found our sperm!
 Chandler:Yeah you think so well? Should I ask him?
 Chandler:Why not just because his great-grandmother was obese our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
 Chandler:Yeah he's better!
 Chandler:Really? Are you sure?
 Chandler:(sighs with relief) Thank God because I don't wanna do this either. You know I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know I'm the husband I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
 Chandler:So you know this leaves us with...
 Chandler:How do you feel about that?
 Chandler:Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
 Chandler:(smiling) Yeah.
 Chandler:We are gonna be great parents.
 Chandler:Wait if we're lucky and we're really really really quiet we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
 Chandler:Hey Zack!
 Chandler:Look I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:My wife and I have some boundary issues you know sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
 Chandler:You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby would ya?
 Chandler:Yeah Ross I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do you know island's stuff.
 Chandler:Yeah that's the same as it has something to do with wind.
 Chandler:(upset) She does?
 Chandler:I wouldn't read too much into it.
 Chandler:David let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice go to Ross Monica or... Joey if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
 Chandler:Seriously we're gonna do this?
 Chandler:Oh because his penis was too big. (he notices that David is not amused) Oh I'm sorry that's the kind of thing I do. (pause) They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:I didn't mean now...
 Chandler:Well you're welcome! Glad I could help.
 Chandler:David I'm pretending to read here!!
 Chandler:(smiling cheekily) I do! Want a hint? huh? I do (Monica looks confused so Chandler repeats) I do.
 Chandler:David is going to propose to Phoebe.
 Chandler:Be-cause we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
 Chandler:I did! A penis one! Look just so I know what was so wrong about what I said?
 Chandler:Man that's some bad advice!
 Chandler:That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
 Chandler:Tonight?! (looks at the ring) Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) Oh there it is!
 Chandler:(slaps him on the shoulder) Nice! (goes to Monica)
 Chandler:Monica can I talk to you for a sec? (Pulls her away from Phoebe and Rachel)
 Chandler:David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
 Chandler:That would be advice!!
 Chandler:Oh is it on the computer cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
 Chandler:(offended) What? (pause) May I?
 Chandler:(at the laptop) Oh no no no dear God no!
 Chandler:Your computer I don't know wha... everything's gone!
 Chandler:It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
 Chandler:Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
 Chandler:Well it didn't say This is a virus!!
 Chandler:Nude... (Ross looks at him)... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
 Chandler:It's not gone! I mean I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy right?
 Chandler:Well you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
 Chandler:I just feel awful.
 Chandler:Well I tried Billy Jean King but... (Ross glares at him) you know you and Monica have the same I'm gonna kill you look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... (Ross continues to glare at him and Chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss Ross)
 Chandler:(pretending not to sense the tone) Oooh! I hope you're happy too honey!
 Chandler:Phoebe is going to say yes? That's that's great!
 Chandler:And there's not chance that will work?
 Chandler:(pointing at her) Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
 Chandler:This vacation sucks!!
 Chandler:You know it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
 Chandler:I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? (doing David) Uh Phoebe uh I would be honoured uh... Spit it out David!
 Chandler:I wouldn't brag too much about that thing big guy.
 Chandler:Oh ain't this nice? It's so quiet I could just lie here all day.
 Chandler:I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
 Chandler:Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
 Chandler:Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
 Chandler:(to a paleontologist sitting next to him) Not to mention the cold sores.
 Chandler:(to the one sitting next to him) Really?
 Chandler:I don't think so!
 Chandler:Because you know how competitive you get and well I say it's cute others disagree and I'm lying!
 Chandler:Oh yeah? What happened when we played last time?
 Chandler:And...?
 Chandler:I'm not playing with you.
 Chandler:She gets crazy! This scar (points to his forehead) is from Pictionary!
 Chandler:(nearly whispering) Oh dear God there's two of them!
 Chandler:(to Phoebe) Did you know this about him?
 Chandler:(interrupting her) OK!
 Chandler:Honey try to focus the trash talk on him!
 Chandler:(to Phoebe) Do you really find this attractive on him?
 Chandler:I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
 Chandler:Okay-dokay you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
 Chandler:Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
 Chandler:(exhausted) Ok look! Enough is enough!
 Chandler:Monica that was also true an hour ago! I mean please look at you! Your hand is blistered you can barely stand your hair is inexplicable! Ok you've already proven you are just as good as he is now we've missed our dinner reservations so now let's just go upstairs order room service take a shower and shave your head!
 Chandler:But...
 Chandler:What about the obsessive cleaning?
 Chandler:You ok?
 Chandler:No you didn't.
 Chandler:Because I'm gonna play for ya.
 Chandler:(In a loving voice) Yes I do. Now I may not understand why you have to win so badly but if it's important to you then it's important to me because I love you.
 Chandler:(Still in a loving voice) You're welcome sweetheart.
 Chandler:All right Mike let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point wins.
 Chandler:And that's... how... it's done!
 Chandler:I never sucked I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
 Chandler:I don't know.
 Chandler:That's why!
 Chandler:You know I'd love to but I'm a little tired.
 Chandler:You're on!
 Chandler:He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups and then talk to his triceps.
 Chandler:She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
 Chandler:Wow!
 Chandler:How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
 Chandler:Anything?
 Chandler:You do realise that's your brother?
 Chandler:That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
 Chandler:Okay Buckwheat!
 Chandler:And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
 Chandler:(caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!
 Chandler:He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)
 Chandler:You got it!
 Chandler:Okay well we'll go back in there but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?
 Chandler:Enunciate!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Not quite. Monica's still at the salon and I'm just finishing packing.
 Chandler:You're not supposed to take that. Besides it's a New Testament what are you gonna do with it?
 Chandler:Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
 Chandler:I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
 Chandler:What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
 Chandler:Yeah it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
 Chandler:Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
 Chandler:You go back to work tomorrow night right?
 Chandler:So if you want people to see them then by definition you're not having them taken out... say at the break of dawn?
 Chandler:What are you singing?
 Chandler:It's Ride of the Valkyries from Apocalypse Now... See here's the thing The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home we don't have that problem anymore so if you think about it... I hate them!
 Chandler:Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
 Chandler:Again let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
 Chandler:Hit yourself in the tooth?
 Chandler:Honey you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?
 Chandler:Really? What happened?
 Chandler:You can't move at all?
 Chandler:If I untangle you will you please get rid of the corn rose?
 Chandler:(trying to untangle her) Some of these look a little frayed.
 Chandler:Now that I untangled you how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
 Chandler:I think you know.
 Chandler:This is what I want to do.
 Chandler:(Picks up the Miss Congeniality DVD) She's an FBI agent posing as a beauty contestant.
 Chandler:There's a hair in my coffee.
 Chandler:You know it's funny. Every time you say triplets I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
 Chandler:So a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room huh?
 Chandler:I mean you have a lovely home.
 Chandler:That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?
 Chandler:You want me to wash my hands first don't you?
 Chandler:Hey you must be Owen.
 Chandler:I'm Chandler. Hey I was in the scouts too.
 Chandler:Yeah in fact my father was a den-mother.
 Chandler:You know how to use a compass?
 Chandler:You do? That's fantastic!
 Chandler:I'd love to but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:I got nothing.
 Chandler:Where are Bill and Colleen?
 Chandler:We have to leave!!
 Chandler:I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
 Chandler:But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
 Chandler:See? Intuitive!
 Chandler:Which technically now you should give back!
 Chandler:I'm so sorry but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. Owen doesn't know he's adopted and he also thinks that Santa is real.
 Chandler:Owen didn't know he was adopted and Monica told him.
 Chandler:Yeah but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
 Chandler:I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. (Runs off.)
 Chandler:So you and Rachel tonight huh?
 Chandler:Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
 Chandler:What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
 Chandler:How can you be so confident?
 Chandler:Really? Like you have a routine?
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh in a funny and awkard way)
 Chandler:Oh I see what you mean that's quite nice. (They look at each other both embarassed)
 Chandler:...and beer!!
 Chandler:Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
 Chandler:She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Why...why?
 Chandler:Sure then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
 Chandler:Hey Pheebs!
 Chandler:Who's Amanda?
 Chandler:Are you trying to do a British accent?
 Chandler:Just so I know how many more of those can I expect?
 Chandler:No had it done to me though. Feels good !
 Chandler:Hello? Is someone on the line?
 Chandler:Hang on she’s right here. (he enters the living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone for ya.
 Chandler:(to Amanda) I get pedicures!
 Chandler:Hold on! There is something different.
 Chandler:Was that place... The Sun?
 Chandler:Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
 Chandler:How was your date with Joey?
 Chandler:You didn't like that?
 Chandler:(without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't know! (Monica just smiles)
 Chandler:If she asks I protested a little but ok!
 Chandler:Well aren't you a treat.
 Chandler:That fake British woman is a real bitch but she sure can dance... Hey!
 Chandler:Kinda... you know sneaking around having to hide from you guys...
 Chandler:Actually no. No it felt right. You know it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
 Chandler:I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)
 Chandler:Dude it's Chandler. Let me in.
 Chandler:I know I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
 Chandler:No I just had to get a picture of this.
 Chandler:I see you later!
 Chandler:Honey I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
 Chandler:Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
 Chandler:There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
 Chandler:Fine but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
 Chandler:Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
 Chandler:Oh sure she was probably up all night excited about the party she knows is happening.
 Chandler:I know what are we gonna do?
 Chandler:I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
 Chandler:To be fair this one does have nuts.
 Chandler:Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
 Chandler:We used to be married but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed and switches the camcorder off)
 Chandler:Was that Emma? Is she up?
 Chandler:I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
 Chandler:To the bathroom!
 Chandler:(Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and Joey come out looking shocked)
 Chandler:You do know I can just turn them the other way around right?
 Chandler:I'm begging you stop.
 Chandler:(Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
 Chandler:Thats a bear.
 Chandler:Ok on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
 Chandler:I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
 Chandler:They left.
 Chandler:I'm sorry is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
 Chandler:Emma you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old that's little.
 Chandler:Ooh! That's my girl!
 Chandler:Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
 Chandler:Me too...
 Chandler:There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
 Chandler:I was kidding.
 Chandler:No not yet.
 Chandler:Hey guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
 Chandler:Emma how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index finger again)
 Chandler:Let's do it come on!
 Chandler:Thanks!
 Chandler:Joey we would've asked you we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
 Chandler:So excited about your letter!
 Chandler:So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
 Chandler:That's where people make number two!!
 Chandler:(reading) I don’t... uh... understand.
 Chandler:On every word?
 Chandler:And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
 Chandler:You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus just write from here (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.
 Chandler:I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
 Chandler:Word!
 Chandler:She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a guy..?
 Chandler:Oh I don't think it was desperate I think it was amazing!
 Chandler:Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
 Chandler:Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
 Chandler:Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
 Chandler:It's ok it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)
 Chandler:(on the phone) Hello this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).
 Chandler:(Still looks confused) They loved it.
 Chandler:They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
 Chandler:She guessed 8 9 based on his drawings.
 Chandler:That sounds like fun.
 Chandler:I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) ... but I am wrong!
 Chandler:Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
 Chandler:Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
 Chandler:Hey I'm sorry I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.
 Chandler:(he enters) Hey honey!
 Chandler:Is Monica not here?
 Chandler:Oh then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
 Chandler:Yeah and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! (silence) Hell you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!
 Chandler:Oh... I don't know I really don't think you're right for the part.
 Chandler:First of all. Bravo. Uh but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
 Chandler:Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
 Chandler:Hey you guys.
 Chandler:Joe I told you you're just not right for the part.
 Chandler:Joe...
 Chandler:Fine!
 Chandler:Work Joe!
 Chandler:He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!
 Chandler:That's good! I liked it they didn't. (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey for God's sake go to work! (Joey runs away).
 Chandler:Hey Joe!
 Chandler:Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
 Chandler:(Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man.
 Chandler:(sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey continues to look at him suspiciously) But ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!
 Chandler:(looks surprised) What!? Of course I did!
 Chandler:I'm not lying to you I watched it!
 Chandler:I watched it!
 Chandler:(now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did!
 Chandler:(following him) I'm telling you I watched the tape. (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face)
 Chandler:In a sarcastic of course not!-tone) No!
 Chandler:I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
 Chandler:What did I just say?
 Chandler:Yes and I have to say I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
 Chandler:Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
 Chandler:He really is a chameleon.
 Chandler:Look I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.
 Chandler:I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
 Chandler:Lying is wrong!
 Chandler:I'm a pretty little girl.
 Chandler:That's funny we were doing the same thing!
 Chandler:Yeah it is really pricey. I mean I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
 Chandler:It was pretty simple actually I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you get married!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
 Chandler:You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
 Chandler:Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
 Chandler:(pointing at himself) Little people?
 Chandler:What...? NO!
 Chandler:(he stands up and he feels very offended) I don't and I'm offended by the insinuation!
 Chandler:I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine but that tape is not mine.
 Chandler:Ok ok here we go.
 Chandler:Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door and both are smiling exaggeratedly)
 Chandler:But you already gave all your money to charity!
 Chandler:I don’t think you can do that!
 Chandler:That’s sweet honey but save something for the adoption Lady.
 Chandler:Oh because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well not actually to death that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
 Chandler:But other than that... wholesome wholesome building.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Of course it was!
 Chandler:RAT BASTARD!
 Chandler:Oh it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with 
 Chandler:(Screams to interrupt Joey) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
 Chandler:Oh just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey bangs on 
 Chandler:WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
 Chandler:Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
 Chandler:(nervous smile) You can't make this stuff up!
 Chandler:What the hell are you doing?
 Chandler:Well we're not.
 Chandler:We don't have a code word.
 Chandler:Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously)
 Chandler:(escorting Joey to the door) You have to get out of here. You slept with 
 Chandler:Ok!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:And for the last time we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat)
 Chandler:I can explain... Joey...
 Chandler:Oh that's really ok.
 Chandler:Wrong number?
 Chandler:That's great!
 Chandler:Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
 Chandler:Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
 Chandler:Well it's just with uhm work and the stress of adoption we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
 Chandler:No no! We made this decision together.
 Chandler:Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
 Chandler:We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
 Chandler:Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
 Chandler:You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean we could be getting a baby soon!
 Chandler:Somebody is gonna pick us.
 Chandler:I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you me and the little Hemingway Bing. (pause) What he's my favourite author!
 Chandler:(after a long pause) The Firm?
 Chandler:You know you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
 Chandler:I'm serious let me do something just not the turkey or the stuffing nothing high profile.
 Chandler:Tell me more.
 Chandler:You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Hmm the game's at one.
 Chandler:Dinner is at four we'll never gonna make it back.
 Chandler:You say that now but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
 Chandler:Look Monica has been working hard all day she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place we shouldn't go!
 Chandler:Okay. (pause) And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
 Chandler:I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
 Chandler:(peeping) They're out there!
 Chandler:(peeping) Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says Rangers on it. They went to the game!
 Chandler:(looking through the peephole again) Ross' shirt is torn.
 Chandler:Yeah and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to Monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?
 Chandler:(relieved) Oh thank God!
 Chandler:(looking through the peephole) That's a lie you went to the game I can see Joey's hand.
 Chandler:Guys I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. (Monica looks at Chandler)
 Chandler:HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
 Chandler:Please let me stay on this side of the door.
 Chandler:The cranberries...?
 Chandler:He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him don't look at him! (They both look away)
 Chandler:The floating heads do make a good point.
 Chandler:Well you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late and you still went anyway.
 Chandler:That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
 Chandler:A little late for that.
 Chandler:Uhm we've got turkey grease.
 Chandler:Can you ever feel your ears?
 Chandler:(sarcastically) Oh I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
 Chandler:Okay look I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out okay? Okay so PUSH!
 Chandler:Come on guys PUSH!
 Chandler:My cranberries!
 Chandler:Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
 Chandler:(to Monica) Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
 Chandler:What's going on?
 Chandler:And?
 Chandler:Are you serious? (they hug)
 Chandler:That is the exact same thing.
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:We're just here to say goodbye we're off to Ohio.
 Chandler:And so incorrect!
 Chandler:Uhm thank you but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
 Chandler:Yeah. I mean this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
 Chandler:I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
 Chandler:So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
 Chandler:Yes but...
 Chandler:Oh screw it I'm gonna be a daddy!!
 Chandler:Yeah. Just weird you know. It's like Hi I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?
 Chandler:You're gonna be great.
 Chandler:Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
 Chandler:Ok.
 Chandler:That's what our friends call us.
 Chandler:(astonished) I don't think that's exactly...
 Chandler:So the fact that I am a doctor and my wife’s a reverend that’s important to you?
 Chandler:Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
 Chandler:Yeah wow.
 Chandler:No-ot for me it doesn’t.
 Chandler:Yeah actually. So you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
 Chandler:You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..
 Chandler:Yeah I did.
 Chandler:We are NOT signing those papers.
 Chandler:It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
 Chandler:You have gotta stop!
 Chandler:She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
 Chandler:Your Veal Chop is $3495!
 Chandler:But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
 Chandler:I know..
 Chandler:oh honey..
 Chandler:Monica I want a baby too but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to. 
 Chandler:So we'll tell the truth and who knows maybe she'll like us for us.
 Chandler:You're Jewish.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
 Chandler:I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
 Chandler:Well our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
 Chandler:Erica wait!
 Chandler:You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
 Chandler:Erica please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
 Chandler:But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
 Chandler:You still want that baby?
 Chandler:All right Joey be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
 Chandler:Sounds like a date to me.
 Chandler:Alright so I'm back in high school I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria and I realize I am totally naked.
 Chandler:Then I look down and I realize there's a phone... there.
 Chandler:That's right.
 Chandler:All of a sudden the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do everybody starts looking at me.
 Chandler:Finally I figure I'd better answer it and it turns out it's my mother which is very-very weird because- she never calls me!
 Chandler:Cookie?
 Chandler:Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?
 Chandler:And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
 Chandler:(imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!
 Chandler:(re TV) Ooh she should not be wearing those pants.
 Chandler:Please don't do that again it's a horrible sound.
 Chandler:Ooh this is a Dear Diary moment.
 Chandler:I'm sorry I didn't catch your name. Paul was it?
 Chandler:(deadpan) Yes and we're very excited about it.
 Chandler:It's a beautiful thing.
 Chandler:I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
 Chandler:I have no idea.
 Chandler:All finished!
 Chandler:Yes please don't spoil all this fun.
 Chandler:Oh God.
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:You must stop! (Chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)
 Chandler:Look Ross you gotta understand between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!
 Chandler:Stay out of my freezer! [Scene A Restaurant Monica and Paul are still eating.]
 Chandler:Angela's the screamer Andrea has cats.
 Chandler:That is amazing.
 Chandler:If can invade Poland there isn't anything I can't do.
 Chandler:Hi Paul is it?
 Chandler:All right kids I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers... it doesn't make much of a difference...
 Chandler:'Look Gippetto I'm a real live boy.'
 Chandler:You're right I'm sorry. (Burst into song and dances out of the door.) Once I was a wooden boy a little wooden boy...
 Chandler:And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
 Chandler:Oh how well you know me...
 Chandler:(as Rachel is cutting up her cards) Y'know if you listen closely you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
 Chandler:Did you make it or are you just serving it?
 Chandler:Kids new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. (Rachel sits down to hear Chandler's dream.)
 Chandler:Okay so I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
 Chandler:(looking at her) Seriously answer faster!
 Chandler:(to Phoebe) It's like a giant hug.
 Chandler:(picking up the phone) Hello.
 Chandler:Oh uhm... I have to work too. Yeah I'm stuck at the office all day.
 Chandler:Those are all really old!
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:I was in the car with Nancy all day.
 Chandler:Well at least the perfume is not mine be thankful for that!
 Chandler:It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.
 Chandler:And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) What were the things you said?
 Chandler:And the fireplace in the bedroom.
 Chandler:This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
 Chandler:I don’t know. What do you think?
 Chandler:I do too.
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:I don’t know what you mean giant talking cigarette! Oh by the way Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car so if she asks you I was at work all day.
 Chandler:We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean why upset everybody over nothing.
 Chandler:I know. Gooooood luck with it.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Is it me or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
 Chandler:Yeah (motions them to sit and they do) I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
 Chandler:...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
 Chandler:Actually we already found a house we love.
 Chandler:Bet you wish I was having an affair now huh?
 Chandler:I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
 Chandler:(goes towards Joey) You know that's not the reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)
 Chandler:Hey that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
 Chandler:If you win we give up the birds.
 Chandler:But if we win we get your apartment.
 Chandler:Dangerous Liaisons.
 Chandler:Fancy.
 Chandler:Fancy guest.
 Chandler:Thanks man.
 Chandler:Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
 Chandler:(To Monica) Wow! Listen we had a good run. You know what was it? Four? Five months? I mean that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So good-bye take care bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)
 Chandler:Well I think I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
 Chandler:Look we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay I'm in love with her.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey.
 Chandler:I know. (He kisses her.)
 Chandler:No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
 Chandler:Sure!
 Chandler:Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned but for me this has been really great you know I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway I was just thinking I mean if you'd gone to Vail and if you guys'd been with your family if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be all together you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
 Chandler:Here here!
 Chandler:Hello? It's Nancy they responded to our offer.
 Chandler:(to Nancy) Okay thanks... (to Monica) They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:That's okay we understand.
 Chandler:Yeah... Well it's a good thing we got it then.
 Chandler:We got the house.
 Chandler:I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
 Chandler:We're getting the house. (they hug) We're getting the house.
 Chandler:We're growing up.
 Chandler:So who's gonna tell them?
 Chandler:Not it! Damn it!
 Chandler:You'll see.
 Chandler:Well I didn't know how to tell you before but... We got the house.
 Chandler:What did I marry into?
 Chandler:You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
 Chandler:(to Monica) I'm leaving you.
 Chandler:Who?
 Chandler:(looking around) Did I go to this school?
 Chandler:(looks over at her) Sure nice.
 Chandler:You're right by saying nice I'm virtually licking her.
 Chandler:Are you asking permission to break the pact?
 Chandler:Awesome the name really stands out.
 Chandler:Man we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:You know our band is playing on Friday.
 Chandler:Fresh!
 Chandler:Mint!
 Chandler:I know it. You know I'm totally gonna ask her out.
 Chandler:I said it first bro.
 Chandler:(angrily) Look if you did...
 Chandler:Totally. I had sex in High school...
 Chandler:All right I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
 Chandler:All right so that's Missy Goldberg Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald who neither of us can go out with.
 Chandler:Oh and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
 Chandler:Well I officially give you permission to break the pact.
 Chandler:Your hands are shaking.
 Chandler:(to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and Ross move away from them). That didn't make us sound gay at all!
 Chandler:Ross that was 16 years ago!
 Chandler:I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (Ross just stares at him) All right look if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
 Chandler:Oh really?
 Chandler:Oh really!?
 Chandler:ADRIENNE TURNER!! (A girl behind them turns around)
 Chandler:Oh please and you knew how much I liked her.
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:Aren't you...?
 Chandler:(smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So how're you doing?
 Chandler:Hi Monica.
 Chandler:O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. (Goes off to find Ross.)
 Chandler:Well I did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) That's when I wrote the song Betrayal In The Common Room.
 Chandler:Look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
 Chandler:(smiling a little nervously) Hmm mmmhm..
 Chandler:(sighs) Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought who does Ross like the more than anybody?
 Chandler:Not her!
 Chandler:Soo... you girls having fun?
 Chandler:Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
 Chandler:Well maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
 Chandler:So where are you applying to?
 Chandler:I'm in college and I'm in a band.
 Chandler:Yeah but it was like a million years ago so it doesn't matter.
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:You kissed her that night too?
 Chandler:Seriously where did this happen?
 Chandler:Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
 Chandler:I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
 Chandler:Why would I kiss a girl and then put her on your bed?
 Chandler:What did I marry into?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner you know I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
 Chandler:No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
 Chandler:(to Rachel) You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
 Chandler:Heh.
 Chandler:This is like figure skating team all over again. (Phoebe and Ross glare at him astonished) I mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) I mean- I mean the balance beam. (to Ross) Help me!
 Chandler:Thank you.
 Chandler:I know I hate being left out of things.
 Chandler:Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
 Chandler:What happened?
 Chandler:(standing up too) M-Me-me-me!
 Chandler:Pick me I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
 Chandler:Oh I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
 Chandler:You are going downer!
 Chandler:(almost crying) I wouldn't know I didn't make it! (they hug)
 Chandler:Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
 Chandler:Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
 Chandler:Hey can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me you'll be getting some comedy!
 Chandler:Let me tell you why you need to pick me. (Goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. Rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) See when I was a kid I was always left out of everything you know and it really made me feel... insecure. You know I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway If I'm the only one left out of this wedding I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
 Chandler:(Getting up and raising his fist in victory) Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make groom for Chandler.
 Chandler:How's it going?
 Chandler:(smiling to himself too) That's what I was doing too.
 Chandler:You too.
 Chandler:Me too.
 Chandler:I'm not supposed to tell you.
 Chandler:You told us both we could be in the wedding? (they both stare at Rachel)
 Chandler:Rach Rach knock knock.
 Chandler:I'll tell you at the wedding.
 Chandler:So technically would this person be in the wedding?
 Chandler:I'm not scared. (moves towards Mike and Chappy) I'll just take little Chappy and... (he backs out) HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
 Chandler:(quickly) I'll do it.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Na ha ha... (to Chappy) Ne he he... (Ross moves Chappy to Chandler who quickly backs away) Ah ah...
 Chandler:(to Monica) Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
 Chandler:Oh yeah! (Monica walks outside)
 Chandler:Ready?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
 Chandler:You look beautiful.
 Chandler:That really was an incredible wedding.
 Chandler:I'd love to but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
 Chandler:I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
 Chandler:So where's Mike?
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Why are you wearing my apron?
 Chandler:Oh hey when she gets here is it ok if I introduce you two as my wife and the woman who's carrying my child? (she's not amused) No? Divorce?
 Chandler:Oh those places! There's always so many people their being corralled like cattle and... you know there's always some idiot who goes Mooooo!
 Chandler:I'm so sorry...
 Chandler:Monica. Calm self.
 Chandler:Why would you say that?
 Chandler:Great! (to Monica) This baby'd better to be really good.
 Chandler:(enters the room wearing an I love New York t-shirt a Statue of Liberty hat and carrying bags) New York is awesome!
 Chandler:Yeah I've been to these places before but I've never really seen them you know.
 Chandler:Oh uhm okay uhm do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
 Chandler:That's great.
 Chandler:So what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
 Chandler:I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
 Chandler:Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! (He turns the light on)
 Chandler:Honey it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
 Chandler:I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
 Chandler:I dunno aren't there tests for these things right?
 Chandler:Pff easy for you to say he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says mom on his shovel-wielding arm!
 Chandler:Hey! How was lunch?
 Chandler:(struggling) Oh really?
 Chandler:O-okay. (steps closer to Monica and speaks softly) So is she gonna take the test?
 Chandler:Oh God. It's shovely-Joe isn't it?
 Chandler:How do you know?
 Chandler:Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
 Chandler:(nods in appreciation) Shovely Joe!
 Chandler:Yeah I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
 Chandler:You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah like you wouldn't have done it. (she shrugs)
 Chandler:A dinosaur died a million years ago?
 Chandler:YOU NEVER DID IT!
 Chandler:Hey! I will have you know that... aah who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
 Chandler:Mrs Hannigan?
 Chandler:Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
 Chandler:Yeah come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
 Chandler:Damn it.
 Chandler:That's what we were gonna name the baby.
 Chandler:Hey how'd the interview go?
 Chandler:You know I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
 Chandler:That is a bad interview.
 Chandler:Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
 Chandler:To Ross!
 Chandler:And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said but thank you.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:When your head was hanging out the window it didn't hit a mailbox did it?
 Chandler:Man those two dogs are going at it!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Really? What changed your mind?
 Chandler:Joey there was a little girl who lived here but she died like 30 years ago.
 Chandler:Ha! I'm just messing with you.
 Chandler:You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
 Chandler:It's seven years ago. (he looks surprised) My time machine works!
 Chandler:Excuse me?
 Chandler:For your information I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
 Chandler:How did the job stuff go?
 Chandler:That's great!
 Chandler:How did the job stuff go?
 Chandler:Or facing a bitch of a commute.
 Chandler:My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (Monica looks at him and can't really place what he just said)
 Chandler:Well it makes me feel sad but...
 Chandler:I see.
 Chandler:Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
 Chandler:We close escrow tomorrow so seeing another house can only confuse us and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
 Chandler:What do you think Pheebs?
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:You're kidding!
 Chandler:Oh yeah?
 Chandler:I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
 Chandler:Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown I think we're okay.
 Chandler:It feels like we’re cheating on our house. And if we’re gonna cheat shouldn’t it be with like a hot younger house that does stuff that our house won’t do?
 Chandler:And yet I never run into Beyonce!
 Chandler:(at Janice's punching) Don't don't! (looks disgusted)
 Chandler:(To Monica and with bulging eyes) Why!?
 Chandler:This can not be happening!
 Chandler:The only way that that is going to happen is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
 Chandler:That is a great idea! And by the way I don't mean to sound distasteful but when did you start crapping money!?
 Chandler:Alright alright we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
 Chandler:Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and (apes Janice's voice) Oh My God!
 Chandler:(looks afraid but at the same time knows she's right) Well we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly outside) Oh that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)
 Chandler:The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
 Chandler:Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
 Chandler:Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
 Chandler:I never stopped loving you.
 Chandler:Yeah yeah yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
 Chandler:Now that you live next door we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
 Chandler:(stunned) Obviously.
 Chandler:Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
 Chandler:I understand.
 Chandler:(speaking as in pain) They're never coming down now.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
 Chandler:Where's your passport?
 Chandler:Well it's not.
 Chandler:We're taking a break!
 Chandler:Jumping on the bed?
 Chandler:No no no guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
 Chandler:(holding a pair of furry handcuffs) What the hell is this?
 Chandler:I didn't know Monica had these!
 Chandler:Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:I know she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. (Ross and Joey looks puzzled) I mean... oh forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
 Chandler:Yes Joe?
 Chandler:Oh yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
 Chandler:Oh yeah right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
 Chandler:Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
 Chandler:Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting! (he looks excited)
 Chandler:(he doesn't look excited anymore). Well played.
 Chandler:Uh Rach?
 Chandler:(to Rachel) Uh Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. (shows her the cuffs)
 Chandler:No no no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
 Chandler:Don't say Richard! Well if they're not Monica's and they're not yours then whose are they?
 Chandler:Pheebs!
 Chandler:I think these are yours.
 Chandler:Sure. (to Phoebe) You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
 Chandler:Let me just say something... Because once we get into this I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
 Chandler:Ooh not so tight... (blows raspberry and the hug ends) I'm sorry just give me one more chance.
 Chandler:I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't I can't.
 Chandler:Oh you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
 Chandler:That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
 Chandler:Mine was a humdinger
 Chandler:Well you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
 Chandler:Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
 Chandler:(to Joey) You couldn't be cool. (he goes to the guest bedroom)
 Chandler:Hey Mon I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
 Chandler:Well I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
 Chandler:Monica's grandmother.
 Chandler:Relax! We just get her some antacids.
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Honey it's gonna be okay.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Next time can I say breathe?
 Chandler:Where are you going?
 Chandler:You can't leave me alone with her.
 Chandler:This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
 Chandler:It's just that we've never spent any time you know alone together.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:So ah... Any plans for the summer?
 Chandler:Hah. May not wanna mention this. So you ever wonder which is worse you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
 Chandler:Well it's just interesting. You know because no one will ever know because no one can experience both.
 Chandler:One of life's great unanswerable questions. I mean who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
 Chandler:Is it really that bad?
 Chandler:I'm okay.
 Chandler:Alright. Wow that is one disgusting miracle.
 Chandler:Wow!
 Chandler:(emotional) It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
 Chandler:Well that's spongy.
 Chandler:I know. He has your eyes.
 Chandler:I mean I know that's not possible but he does.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:How do you feel?
 Chandler:Oh yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
 Chandler:Well gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
 Chandler:Interesting! (To Monica) Can I see you for a second?
 Chandler:What do we do?
 Chandler:(panicking) Twins! Twins!!
 Chandler:Uh-huh! Join me won't you?! Okay what do you say we keep one and then just like have an option on the other one?
 Chandler:Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion and then years later they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean that's a great day for everybody.
 Chandler:What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
 Chandler:Monica we are not ready to have two babies!
 Chandler:(smiles) Okay. Shhh...
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:(shocked) She? It's a girl?
 Chandler:(To Monica) Well now we have one of each! (To the doctor) And that's enough!
 Chandler:Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
 Chandler:Bye!
 Chandler:Have fun at church-camp!
 Chandler:I know! You ready to trade?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:We could trade later.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Her name is Erica.
 Chandler:Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
 Chandler:I love you.
 Chandler:I have no idea what's going on but I am excited!
 Chandler:We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift but now we understand you were doing this.
 Chandler:Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
 Chandler:Oh don't worry we'll find them.
 Chandler:Alright.
 Chandler:It's okay it's just an egg roll.
 Chandler:Okay let's find these birds.
 Chandler:Well that can't be good!
 Chandler:How?
 Chandler:Oh tons I'm quite the woodsman.
 Chandler:Joey wait! The ball!
 Chandler:I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
 Chandler:No... It's all glued together.
 Chandler:I don't know. Maybe.
 Chandler:I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
 Chandler:Did that movie ever get made?
 Chandler:And we're also gonna buy you tiny bird hearing-aids.
 Chandler:What's the matter?
 Chandler:I understand.
 Chandler:I don't know. Except that for one last time... (he touches the players as he says the following) Good game good game good game good game good game good game good game.
 Chandler:Well I can't do it either.
 Chandler:We have to bust it open but neither of us can do it!
 Chandler:That was... Impressive.
 Chandler:Sorry about the table man.
 Chandler:You gonna buy a new one?
 Chandler:Well at least we got these little guys out.
 Chandler:Aww we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand huh?
 Chandler:Hey you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
 Chandler:Yeah I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And plus here they'd have their own room.
 Chandler:You know I - I think you're set with the poultry.
 Chandler:I think there may be another reason. So awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
 Chandler:Wow this is weird.
 Chandler:Where's Ross?
 Chandler:(to his children) Look around you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place filled with love and laughter. But more important because of rent control it was a friggin' steal!
 Chandler:Oh okay.
 Chandler:Oh it's gonna be okay.
 Chandler:Sure. Where?
 Chandler:Yeah I think for us kissing is pretty much like an opening act y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
 Chandler:The problem is though after the concert's over no matter how great the show was you girls are always looking for the comedian again y'know? I mean we're in the car we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
 Chandler:Oh I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
 Chandler:Oh uh that would be mine. See I wrote a note to myself and then I realised I didn't need it so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead.
 Chandler:Yes and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
 Chandler:(looking out the window) Ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew!
 Chandler:Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
 Chandler:You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
 Chandler:...Dinah?
 Chandler:Now Monica you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
 Chandler:Boys? We're going in.
 Chandler:Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective huh Mon?
 Chandler:I mean presumably the biggest part of your job is done.
 Chandler:What does she do?
 Chandler:Well no although I did have an imaginary friend who... my parents actually preferred.
 Chandler:I dunno but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
 Chandler:Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
 Chandler:Yeah it's like when you're a kid and your parents put your dog to sleep and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
 Chandler:So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?
 Chandler:Hey that was really good!
 Chandler:Okay. So. Whaddya want from me Damone huh?
 Chandler:Smoke away.
 Chandler:I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
 Chandler:Relax your hand!
 Chandler:Not so much!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Alright now try taking a puff.
 Chandler:Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
 Chandler:It's fine it's fine. Look do you wanna get this part or not? Here.
 Chandler:Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it you feel right. You feel complete.
 Chandler:Nah not so much. Alright now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.)
 Chandler:Oh Satan's minions at work again...
 Chandler:I'm smoking. I'm smoking I'm smoking.
 Chandler:And this- is my reward!
 Chandler:Okay so this time I won't quit!
 Chandler:All right! I'm putting it out I'm putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe's coffee.)
 Chandler:What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
 Chandler:Oh yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties right? (Does the impression)
 Chandler:Yep we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
 Chandler:I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
 Chandler:Well maybe it's a contest y'know? Like collect all five?
 Chandler:Hey this is so unfair!
 Chandler:So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica with that snort when she laughs? I mean what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws why can't you accept me for this?
 Chandler:Hey y'know I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is smoking is cool and you know it.
 Chandler:Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey buddy what's up! Oh she told you about that huh. Well yeah I have one now and then. Well yeah now. Well it's not that big- ..well that's true.. Gee y'know no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well okay thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)
 Chandler:Ooh Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
 Chandler:Joey ate my last stick of gum so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
 Chandler:(deadpan) Ooh I'm alive with pleasure now.
 Chandler:(sarcastic) Oh she's sorry! I feel better!
 Chandler:...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
 Chandler:(leaving) I don't care I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
 Chandler:(returns) Yeah alright.
 Chandler:Uh if I were omnipotent for a day I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
 Chandler:You got waaaay too much free time.
 Chandler:Happy birthday pal!
 Chandler:Well aren't we Mr. The glass is half empty.
 Chandler:Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
 Chandler:(trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon Ross! You me Joey ice guys' night out c'mon whaddya say big guy (Pretending to punch him in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh?
 Chandler:(stops) I have no idea.
 Chandler:You got it.
 Chandler:(looking) Oh this is not that bad.
 Chandler:...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes it to Joey.)
 Chandler:We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
 Chandler:Yes Bunny?
 Chandler:(to Joey) Could've been a peach.
 Chandler:What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
 Chandler:(to Ross) See buddy that's all you need a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
 Chandler:He's open!
 Chandler:Hey look we're on that TV thing!
 Chandler:(to the receptionist)'Scuse me.
 Chandler:Listen it's kind of an emergency. Well I guess you know that or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
 Chandler:Excuse me look we've been here for over an hour and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks through it in a loud voice.) Oh c'mon Dora don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the waiting room.) Y'know I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back he turns and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-!
 Chandler:Yes the moon the glow the magical feeling you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here please?
 Chandler:Well what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
 Chandler:Then what?
 Chandler:So in your whole life you've only been with one—(He gets a look too)—oh.
 Chandler:I think it's great. Y'know it's sweet it's romantic...
 Chandler:No you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross enters off camera)
 Chandler:Oh I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on admit it! All things considered you had fun tonight.
 Chandler:You gotta do it man.
 Chandler:Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves)
 Chandler:Hello? Oh uh Rachel it's the Visa card people.
 Chandler:Alright. (on phone) Yes this is Rachel.
 Chandler:To the left to the left- aww! (They all collapse)
 Chandler:We can? All right I'm tryin' that.
 Chandler:So Saturday night the big night date night Saturday night Sat-ur-day night!
 Chandler:Not a one.
 Chandler:Oh right right shut up.
 Chandler:No I know but it's just so hard you know? I mean you're sitting there with her she has no idea what's happening and then you finally get up the courage to do it and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
 Chandler:Oh thanks but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
 Chandler:Ooh I hate when my father calls me that.
 Chandler:Oh. Well hold on camper are you sure you've thought this thing through?
 Chandler:It's just you and Rachel just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
 Chandler:Yuh-huh.
 Chandler:Well you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?
 Chandler:Oh and uh the fabric softener?
 Chandler:There you go.
 Chandler:Where are they? Where are they?
 Chandler:It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
 Chandler:Here we go.
 Chandler:Hey Janice.
 Chandler:Hey that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here please?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:(covering) What... did you get me there?
 Chandler:Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
 Chandler:That's great.
 Chandler:Well I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
 Chandler:That's it?
 Chandler:Oh yeah that hug looked pretty brutal.
 Chandler:Janice. Hi Janice. Ok here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
 Chandler:Here's the thing Janice. You know I mean it's like we're different. I'm like the bing bing bing. You're like the boom boom (Chandler flails his hand out and hits Janice in the eye)... boom.
 Chandler:Oh my god I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
 Chandler:(to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
 Chandler:Oh I don't know a million?
 Chandler:I'm fine.
 Chandler:I'm not fine. Here she comes.
 Chandler:How do you do that?
 Chandler:We should always always break up together.
 Chandler:I'm free! I'm free!
 Chandler:You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice no fear no sense of impending doom...
 Chandler:(staring at a woman across the room) Ross ten o'clock.
 Chandler:No ten o'clock.
 Chandler:(sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight nine ten o'clock!
 Chandler:She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short fat bald men!
 Chandler:Oh yeah and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
 Chandler:Oh please could she be more out of my league? Ross back me up here.
 Chandler:Thank you buddy.
 Chandler:Y'think?
 Chandler:Oh God I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
 Chandler:Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)
 Chandler:Hi.... um... okay next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name and uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.
 Chandler:Yes yes I did but what I didn't say was what I was about to say what I wanted to say was uh... would you like to go out with me sometime thankyou goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.)
 Chandler:(running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora and she's Italian and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh listen the usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)
 Chandler:Hey kids.
 Chandler:Well I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
 Chandler:It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
 Chandler:Alright. Once I got on the subway right and it was at night and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
 Chandler:We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
 Chandler:Oh I'm sorry so 'we' is?
 Chandler:Who's Rick?
 Chandler:Oh so you're divorced?
 Chandler:Oh I'm sorry then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
 Chandler:So tell me how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
 Chandler:Ethan? There's there's an Ethan?
 Chandler:So explain something to me here uh what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
 Chandler:...Hm.
 Chandler:What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
 Chandler:Well y'know I had some trouble with it at first too but the way I look at it is I get all the good stuff all the fun all the talking all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean this is every guy's fantasy!
 Chandler:Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
 Chandler:Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean she'll scratch your eyes right out.
 Chandler:Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
 Chandler:Oh no it's terrific it's... it's... y'know you deserve this after all your years of struggling you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
 Chandler:Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
 Chandler:C'mon we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom screams and runs back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!
 Chandler:Oh that would be Monica. Hey listen I wanna borrow a coupla things Aurora spent the night I really wanna make her breakfast.
 Chandler:Yeah well I only have twenty minutes until Ethan so y'know.. (He starts to raid the fridge.)
 Chandler:No no resentment believe me it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people so uh.. Monica can you help me with the door? (He has armloads of stuff.)
 Chandler:God I love these fingers...
 Chandler:No actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em look at how happy they are.
 Chandler:Oh no nonononononnononono don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her back down.)
 Chandler:Don't go.
 Chandler:(to himself) Too bad she's leaving.
 Chandler:Well I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
 Chandler:What Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
 Chandler:I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question but- And Andrew is?
 Chandler:Oh so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick Ethan and myself?
 Chandler:Well y'know most women would kill for three guys like us.
 Chandler:You.
 Chandler:Nono just you.
 Chandler:Lose the other guys.
 Chandler:C'mon we're great together why not?
 Chandler:...Well y'know part of me wants that but it's like I'm two guys y'know? I mean one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying y'know 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
 Chandler:I don't know I-I have to listen to both of them they don't exactly let each other finish...
 Chandler:...The second guy.
 Chandler:Sorry the first guy runs the lips.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Big guy?
 Chandler:Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
 Chandler:Oh great. This is just...
 Chandler:Oh my God it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
 Chandler:She's right it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh yeah that is the part to focus on you idiot!
 Chandler:Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
 Chandler:Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill I saw you with some guy last night. Yes he was some guy.
 Chandler:Alright alright alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God do something. Just make contact smile!
 Chandler:There you go!
 Chandler:You're definitely scaring here.
 Chandler:Yeah about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah thanks. (takes phone)
 Chandler:Hey it's me.
 Chandler:Yeah I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
 Chandler:I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
 Chandler:(angry) Put Joey on the phone.
 Chandler:I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
 Chandler:Yeah like that thought never entered my mind.
 Chandler:Um is it sugarless?
 Chandler:Oh then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note If Jill Goodacre offers you gum you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass you take it.
 Chandler:You know on second thought gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him a stick of gum and a strange look) 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice' or 'I'll have a stick' but no no no no. For me gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
 Chandler:(chewing gum) Ah let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm it's impish. Here we go.
 Chandler:Nice going imp. OK it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth.)
 Chandler:Good save! We're back on track and I'm... (grimacing) ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
 Chandler:(gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
 Chandler:OK.
 Chandler:Yes. Yes thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
 Chandler:Hi um I'm account number 7143457. And uh I don't know if you got any of that but I would really like a copy of the tape.
 Chandler:Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
 Chandler:Ah y'see perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent' or 'self-destructive'...
 Chandler:Yes please.
 Chandler:He's a he?
 Chandler:...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
 Chandler:You did?
 Chandler:Huh. Did uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
 Chandler:You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
 Chandler:Well this is fascinating. So uh what is it about me?
 Chandler:Ross is smart and funny d'you ever think that about him?
 Chandler:WHAT IS IT?!
 Chandler:Oh oh a quality good because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
 Chandler:I just have to know okay. Is it my hair?
 Chandler:Hey gorgeous.
 Chandler:No nono don't- don't worry about it. Believe me apparently other people have made the same mistake.
 Chandler:So uh... what do you think it is about me?
 Chandler:...Quality right great.
 Chandler:Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell that's who you saw me with?
 Chandler:Well yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
 Chandler:No! Uh I d'know! The point is if you were gonna set me up with someone I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
 Chandler:Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
 Chandler:Well don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that isn't it?
 Chandler:Nothing just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
 Chandler:You're watching a football game at a funeral?
 Chandler:You are a frightening frightening man.
 Chandler:Oh no-
 Chandler:Hi I'm Chandler and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Who are those people?
 Chandler:Hey Lowell.
 Chandler:So how's it going there in Financial Services?
 Chandler:Good good. Listen heh I dunno what Shelley told you about me but uh... I'm not.
 Chandler:Really.
 Chandler:So- you can tell?
 Chandler:So you don't think I have a a quality?
 Chandler:He is?
 Chandler:Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I wanted to get a Brian I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey Brian.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
 Chandler:That's so funny 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani man slash woman.
 Chandler:Do you know which one you're gonna be?
 Chandler:Good luck man. I hope you get it.
 Chandler:Yes every single one of them.
 Chandler:I thought it was $98.50.
 Chandler:I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact I'd very much like to butter your head.
 Chandler:All right I'm nine years old.
 Chandler:We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
 Chandler:Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
 Chandler:Tonight on a very special Blossom.
 Chandler:Oh you must stop shooping.
 Chandler:No I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
 Chandler:Ok we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing but that's not funny anymore.
 Chandler:The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
 Chandler:No no the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof who's with me?
 Chandler:Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
 Chandler:Do either of you have the keys?
 Chandler:(sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.
 Chandler:Ok Monica only dogs can hear you now so look the door's open. Here we go.
 Chandler:Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
 Chandler:Shall I carve?
 Chandler:Ok who wants light cheese and who wants dark cheese?
 Chandler:I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned but for me this has been really great you know I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway I was just thinking I mean if you'd gone to Vail and if you guys'd been with your family if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be all together you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
 Chandler:Here here!
 Chandler:You know I'd love to but I'm a little tired.
 Chandler:You're on!
 Chandler:He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups and then talk to his triceps.
 Chandler:She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
 Chandler:Wow!
 Chandler:How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
 Chandler:Anything?
 Chandler:You do realise that's your brother?
 Chandler:That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
 Chandler:Okay Buckwheat!
 Chandler:And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
 Chandler:(caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!
 Chandler:He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)
 Chandler:You got it!
 Chandler:Okay well we'll go back in there but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?
 Chandler:Enunciate!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Not quite. Monica's still at the salon and I'm just finishing packing.
 Chandler:You're not supposed to take that. Besides it's a New Testament what are you gonna do with it?
 Chandler:Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
 Chandler:I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
 Chandler:What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
 Chandler:Yeah it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
 Chandler:Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
 Chandler:You go back to work tomorrow night right?
 Chandler:So if you want people to see them then by definition you're not having them taken out... say at the break of dawn?
 Chandler:What are you singing?
 Chandler:It's Ride of the Valkyries from Apocalypse Now... See here's the thing The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home we don't have that problem anymore so if you think about it... I hate them!
 Chandler:Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
 Chandler:Again let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
 Chandler:Hit yourself in the tooth?
 Chandler:Honey you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?
 Chandler:Really? What happened?
 Chandler:You can't move at all?
 Chandler:If I untangle you will you please get rid of the corn rose?
 Chandler:(trying to untangle her) Some of these look a little frayed.
 Chandler:Now that I untangled you how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
 Chandler:I think you know.
 Chandler:This is what I want to do.
 Chandler:(Picks up the Miss Congeniality DVD) She's an FBI agent posing as a beauty contestant.
 Chandler:There's a hair in my coffee.
 Chandler:You know it's funny. Every time you say triplets I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
 Chandler:So a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room huh?
 Chandler:I mean you have a lovely home.
 Chandler:That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?
 Chandler:You want me to wash my hands first don't you?
 Chandler:Hey you must be Owen.
 Chandler:I'm Chandler. Hey I was in the scouts too.
 Chandler:Yeah in fact my father was a den-mother.
 Chandler:You know how to use a compass?
 Chandler:You do? That's fantastic!
 Chandler:I'd love to but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:I got nothing.
 Chandler:Where are Bill and Colleen?
 Chandler:We have to leave!!
 Chandler:I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
 Chandler:But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
 Chandler:See? Intuitive!
 Chandler:Which technically now you should give back!
 Chandler:I'm so sorry but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. Owen doesn't know he's adopted and he also thinks that Santa is real.
 Chandler:Owen didn't know he was adopted and Monica told him.
 Chandler:Yeah but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
 Chandler:I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. (Runs off.)
 Chandler:So you and Rachel tonight huh?
 Chandler:Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
 Chandler:What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
 Chandler:How can you be so confident?
 Chandler:Really? Like you have a routine?
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh in a funny and awkard way)
 Chandler:Oh I see what you mean that's quite nice. (They look at each other both embarassed)
 Chandler:...and beer!!
 Chandler:Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
 Chandler:She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Why...why?
 Chandler:Sure then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
 Chandler:Hey Pheebs!
 Chandler:Who's Amanda?
 Chandler:Are you trying to do a British accent?
 Chandler:Just so I know how many more of those can I expect?
 Chandler:No had it done to me though. Feels good !
 Chandler:Hello? Is someone on the line?
 Chandler:Hang on she’s right here. (he enters the living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone for ya.
 Chandler:(to Amanda) I get pedicures!
 Chandler:Hold on! There is something different.
 Chandler:Was that place... The Sun?
 Chandler:Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
 Chandler:How was your date with Joey?
 Chandler:You didn't like that?
 Chandler:(without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't know! (Monica just smiles)
 Chandler:If she asks I protested a little but ok!
 Chandler:Well aren't you a treat.
 Chandler:That fake British woman is a real bitch but she sure can dance... Hey!
 Chandler:Kinda... you know sneaking around having to hide from you guys...
 Chandler:Actually no. No it felt right. You know it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
 Chandler:I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)
 Chandler:Dude it's Chandler. Let me in.
 Chandler:I know I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
 Chandler:No I just had to get a picture of this.
 Chandler:I see you later!
 Chandler:Honey I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
 Chandler:Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
 Chandler:There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
 Chandler:Fine but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
 Chandler:Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
 Chandler:Oh sure she was probably up all night excited about the party she knows is happening.
 Chandler:I know what are we gonna do?
 Chandler:I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
 Chandler:To be fair this one does have nuts.
 Chandler:Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
 Chandler:We used to be married but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed and switches the camcorder off)
 Chandler:Was that Emma? Is she up?
 Chandler:I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
 Chandler:To the bathroom!
 Chandler:(Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and Joey come out looking shocked)
 Chandler:You do know I can just turn them the other way around right?
 Chandler:I'm begging you stop.
 Chandler:(Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
 Chandler:Thats a bear.
 Chandler:Ok on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
 Chandler:I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
 Chandler:They left.
 Chandler:I'm sorry is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
 Chandler:Emma you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old that's little.
 Chandler:Ooh! That's my girl!
 Chandler:Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
 Chandler:Me too...
 Chandler:There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
 Chandler:I was kidding.
 Chandler:No not yet.
 Chandler:Hey guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
 Chandler:Emma how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index finger again)
 Chandler:Let's do it come on!
 Chandler:Thanks!
 Chandler:Joey we would've asked you we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
 Chandler:So excited about your letter!
 Chandler:So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
 Chandler:That's where people make number two!!
 Chandler:(reading) I don’t... uh... understand.
 Chandler:On every word?
 Chandler:And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
 Chandler:You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus just write from here (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.
 Chandler:I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
 Chandler:Word!
 Chandler:She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a guy..?
 Chandler:Oh I don't think it was desperate I think it was amazing!
 Chandler:Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
 Chandler:Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
 Chandler:Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
 Chandler:It's ok it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)
 Chandler:(on the phone) Hello this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).
 Chandler:(Still looks confused) They loved it.
 Chandler:They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
 Chandler:She guessed 8 9 based on his drawings.
 Chandler:That sounds like fun.
 Chandler:I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) ... but I am wrong!
 Chandler:Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
 Chandler:Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
 Chandler:Hey I'm sorry I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.
 Chandler:(he enters) Hey honey!
 Chandler:Is Monica not here?
 Chandler:Oh then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
 Chandler:Yeah and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! (silence) Hell you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!
 Chandler:Oh... I don't know I really don't think you're right for the part.
 Chandler:First of all. Bravo. Uh but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
 Chandler:Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
 Chandler:Hey you guys.
 Chandler:Joe I told you you're just not right for the part.
 Chandler:Joe...
 Chandler:Fine!
 Chandler:Work Joe!
 Chandler:He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!
 Chandler:That's good! I liked it they didn't. (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey for God's sake go to work! (Joey runs away).
 Chandler:Hey Joe!
 Chandler:Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
 Chandler:(Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man.
 Chandler:(sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey continues to look at him suspiciously) But ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!
 Chandler:(looks surprised) What!? Of course I did!
 Chandler:I'm not lying to you I watched it!
 Chandler:I watched it!
 Chandler:(now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did!
 Chandler:(following him) I'm telling you I watched the tape. (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face)
 Chandler:In a sarcastic of course not!-tone) No!
 Chandler:I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
 Chandler:What did I just say?
 Chandler:Yes and I have to say I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
 Chandler:Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
 Chandler:He really is a chameleon.
 Chandler:Look I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.
 Chandler:I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
 Chandler:Lying is wrong!
 Chandler:I'm a pretty little girl.
 Chandler:That's funny we were doing the same thing!
 Chandler:Yeah it is really pricey. I mean I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
 Chandler:It was pretty simple actually I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you get married!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
 Chandler:You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
 Chandler:Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
 Chandler:(pointing at himself) Little people?
 Chandler:What...? NO!
 Chandler:(he stands up and he feels very offended) I don't and I'm offended by the insinuation!
 Chandler:I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine but that tape is not mine.
 Chandler:Ok ok here we go.
 Chandler:Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door and both are smiling exaggeratedly)
 Chandler:But you already gave all your money to charity!
 Chandler:I don’t think you can do that!
 Chandler:That’s sweet honey but save something for the adoption Lady.
 Chandler:Oh because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well not actually to death that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
 Chandler:But other than that... wholesome wholesome building.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Of course it was!
 Chandler:RAT BASTARD!
 Chandler:Oh it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with 
 Chandler:(Screams to interrupt Joey) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
 Chandler:Oh just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey bangs on 
 Chandler:WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
 Chandler:Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
 Chandler:(nervous smile) You can't make this stuff up!
 Chandler:What the hell are you doing?
 Chandler:Well we're not.
 Chandler:We don't have a code word.
 Chandler:Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously)
 Chandler:(escorting Joey to the door) You have to get out of here. You slept with 
 Chandler:Ok!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:And for the last time we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat)
 Chandler:I can explain... Joey...
 Chandler:Oh that's really ok.
 Chandler:Wrong number?
 Chandler:That's great!
 Chandler:Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
 Chandler:Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
 Chandler:Well it's just with uhm work and the stress of adoption we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
 Chandler:No no! We made this decision together.
 Chandler:Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
 Chandler:We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
 Chandler:Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
 Chandler:You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean we could be getting a baby soon!
 Chandler:Somebody is gonna pick us.
 Chandler:I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you me and the little Hemingway Bing. (pause) What he's my favourite author!
 Chandler:(after a long pause) The Firm?
 Chandler:You know you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
 Chandler:I'm serious let me do something just not the turkey or the stuffing nothing high profile.
 Chandler:Tell me more.
 Chandler:You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Hmm the game's at one.
 Chandler:Dinner is at four we'll never gonna make it back.
 Chandler:You say that now but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
 Chandler:Look Monica has been working hard all day she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place we shouldn't go!
 Chandler:Okay. (pause) And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
 Chandler:I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
 Chandler:(peeping) They're out there!
 Chandler:(peeping) Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says Rangers on it. They went to the game!
 Chandler:(looking through the peephole again) Ross' shirt is torn.
 Chandler:Yeah and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to Monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?
 Chandler:(relieved) Oh thank God!
 Chandler:(looking through the peephole) That's a lie you went to the game I can see Joey's hand.
 Chandler:Guys I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. (Monica looks at Chandler)
 Chandler:HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
 Chandler:Please let me stay on this side of the door.
 Chandler:The cranberries...?
 Chandler:He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him don't look at him! (They both look away)
 Chandler:The floating heads do make a good point.
 Chandler:Well you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late and you still went anyway.
 Chandler:That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
 Chandler:A little late for that.
 Chandler:Uhm we've got turkey grease.
 Chandler:Can you ever feel your ears?
 Chandler:(sarcastically) Oh I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
 Chandler:Okay look I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out okay? Okay so PUSH!
 Chandler:Come on guys PUSH!
 Chandler:My cranberries!
 Chandler:Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
 Chandler:(to Monica) Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
 Chandler:What's going on?
 Chandler:And?
 Chandler:Are you serious? (they hug)
 Chandler:That is the exact same thing.
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:We're just here to say goodbye we're off to Ohio.
 Chandler:And so incorrect!
 Chandler:Uhm thank you but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
 Chandler:Yeah. I mean this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
 Chandler:I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
 Chandler:So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
 Chandler:Yes but...
 Chandler:Oh screw it I'm gonna be a daddy!!
 Chandler:Yeah. Just weird you know. It's like Hi I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?
 Chandler:You're gonna be great.
 Chandler:Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
 Chandler:Ok.
 Chandler:That's what our friends call us.
 Chandler:(astonished) I don't think that's exactly...
 Chandler:So the fact that I am a doctor and my wife’s a reverend that’s important to you?
 Chandler:Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
 Chandler:Yeah wow.
 Chandler:No-ot for me it doesn’t.
 Chandler:Yeah actually. So you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
 Chandler:You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..
 Chandler:Yeah I did.
 Chandler:We are NOT signing those papers.
 Chandler:It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
 Chandler:You have gotta stop!
 Chandler:She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
 Chandler:Your Veal Chop is $3495!
 Chandler:But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
 Chandler:I know..
 Chandler:oh honey..
 Chandler:Monica I want a baby too but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to. 
 Chandler:So we'll tell the truth and who knows maybe she'll like us for us.
 Chandler:You're Jewish.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
 Chandler:I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
 Chandler:Well our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
 Chandler:Erica wait!
 Chandler:You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
 Chandler:Erica please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
 Chandler:But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
 Chandler:You still want that baby?
 Chandler:All right Joey be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
 Chandler:Sounds like a date to me.
 Chandler:Alright so I'm back in high school I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria and I realize I am totally naked.
 Chandler:Then I look down and I realize there's a phone... there.
 Chandler:That's right.
 Chandler:All of a sudden the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do everybody starts looking at me.
 Chandler:Finally I figure I'd better answer it and it turns out it's my mother which is very-very weird because- she never calls me!
 Chandler:Cookie?
 Chandler:Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?
 Chandler:And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
 Chandler:(imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!
 Chandler:(re TV) Ooh she should not be wearing those pants.
 Chandler:Please don't do that again it's a horrible sound.
 Chandler:Ooh this is a Dear Diary moment.
 Chandler:I'm sorry I didn't catch your name. Paul was it?
 Chandler:(deadpan) Yes and we're very excited about it.
 Chandler:It's a beautiful thing.
 Chandler:I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
 Chandler:I have no idea.
 Chandler:All finished!
 Chandler:Yes please don't spoil all this fun.
 Chandler:Oh God.
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:You must stop! (Chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)
 Chandler:Look Ross you gotta understand between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!
 Chandler:Stay out of my freezer! [Scene A Restaurant Monica and Paul are still eating.]
 Chandler:Angela's the screamer Andrea has cats.
 Chandler:That is amazing.
 Chandler:If can invade Poland there isn't anything I can't do.
 Chandler:Hi Paul is it?
 Chandler:All right kids I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers... it doesn't make much of a difference...
 Chandler:'Look Gippetto I'm a real live boy.'
 Chandler:You're right I'm sorry. (Burst into song and dances out of the door.) Once I was a wooden boy a little wooden boy...
 Chandler:And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
 Chandler:Oh how well you know me...
 Chandler:(as Rachel is cutting up her cards) Y'know if you listen closely you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
 Chandler:Did you make it or are you just serving it?
 Chandler:Kids new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. (Rachel sits down to hear Chandler's dream.)
 Chandler:Okay so I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
 Chandler:(looking at her) Seriously answer faster!
 Chandler:(to Phoebe) It's like a giant hug.
 Chandler:(picking up the phone) Hello.
 Chandler:Oh uhm... I have to work too. Yeah I'm stuck at the office all day.
 Chandler:Those are all really old!
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:I was in the car with Nancy all day.
 Chandler:Well at least the perfume is not mine be thankful for that!
 Chandler:It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.
 Chandler:And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) What were the things you said?
 Chandler:And the fireplace in the bedroom.
 Chandler:This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
 Chandler:I don’t know. What do you think?
 Chandler:I do too.
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:I don’t know what you mean giant talking cigarette! Oh by the way Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car so if she asks you I was at work all day.
 Chandler:We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean why upset everybody over nothing.
 Chandler:I know. Gooooood luck with it.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Is it me or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
 Chandler:Yeah (motions them to sit and they do) I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
 Chandler:...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
 Chandler:Actually we already found a house we love.
 Chandler:Bet you wish I was having an affair now huh?
 Chandler:I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
 Chandler:(goes towards Joey) You know that's not the reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)
 Chandler:Hey that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
 Chandler:If you win we give up the birds.
 Chandler:But if we win we get your apartment.
 Chandler:Dangerous Liaisons.
 Chandler:Fancy.
 Chandler:Fancy guest.
 Chandler:Thanks man.
 Chandler:Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
 Chandler:(To Monica) Wow! Listen we had a good run. You know what was it? Four? Five months? I mean that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So good-bye take care bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)
 Chandler:Well I think I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
 Chandler:Look we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay I'm in love with her.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey.
 Chandler:I know. (He kisses her.)
 Chandler:No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
 Chandler:Sure!
 Chandler:Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned but for me this has been really great you know I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway I was just thinking I mean if you'd gone to Vail and if you guys'd been with your family if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be all together you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
 Chandler:Here here!
 Chandler:Hello? It's Nancy they responded to our offer.
 Chandler:(to Nancy) Okay thanks... (to Monica) They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:That's okay we understand.
 Chandler:Yeah... Well it's a good thing we got it then.
 Chandler:We got the house.
 Chandler:I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
 Chandler:We're getting the house. (they hug) We're getting the house.
 Chandler:We're growing up.
 Chandler:So who's gonna tell them?
 Chandler:Not it! Damn it!
 Chandler:You'll see.
 Chandler:Well I didn't know how to tell you before but... We got the house.
 Chandler:What did I marry into?
 Chandler:You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
 Chandler:(to Monica) I'm leaving you.
 Chandler:Who?
 Chandler:(looking around) Did I go to this school?
 Chandler:(looks over at her) Sure nice.
 Chandler:You're right by saying nice I'm virtually licking her.
 Chandler:Are you asking permission to break the pact?
 Chandler:Awesome the name really stands out.
 Chandler:Man we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:You know our band is playing on Friday.
 Chandler:Fresh!
 Chandler:Mint!
 Chandler:I know it. You know I'm totally gonna ask her out.
 Chandler:I said it first bro.
 Chandler:(angrily) Look if you did...
 Chandler:Totally. I had sex in High school...
 Chandler:All right I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
 Chandler:All right so that's Missy Goldberg Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald who neither of us can go out with.
 Chandler:Oh and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
 Chandler:Well I officially give you permission to break the pact.
 Chandler:Your hands are shaking.
 Chandler:(to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and Ross move away from them). That didn't make us sound gay at all!
 Chandler:Ross that was 16 years ago!
 Chandler:I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (Ross just stares at him) All right look if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
 Chandler:Oh really?
 Chandler:Oh really!?
 Chandler:ADRIENNE TURNER!! (A girl behind them turns around)
 Chandler:Oh please and you knew how much I liked her.
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:Aren't you...?
 Chandler:(smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So how're you doing?
 Chandler:Hi Monica.
 Chandler:O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. (Goes off to find Ross.)
 Chandler:Well I did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) That's when I wrote the song Betrayal In The Common Room.
 Chandler:Look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
 Chandler:(smiling a little nervously) Hmm mmmhm..
 Chandler:(sighs) Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought who does Ross like the more than anybody?
 Chandler:Not her!
 Chandler:Soo... you girls having fun?
 Chandler:Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
 Chandler:Well maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
 Chandler:So where are you applying to?
 Chandler:I'm in college and I'm in a band.
 Chandler:Yeah but it was like a million years ago so it doesn't matter.
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:You kissed her that night too?
 Chandler:Seriously where did this happen?
 Chandler:Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
 Chandler:I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
 Chandler:Why would I kiss a girl and then put her on your bed?
 Chandler:What did I marry into?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner you know I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
 Chandler:No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
 Chandler:(to Rachel) You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
 Chandler:Heh.
 Chandler:This is like figure skating team all over again. (Phoebe and Ross glare at him astonished) I mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) I mean- I mean the balance beam. (to Ross) Help me!
 Chandler:Thank you.
 Chandler:I know I hate being left out of things.
 Chandler:Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
 Chandler:What happened?
 Chandler:(standing up too) M-Me-me-me!
 Chandler:Pick me I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
 Chandler:Oh I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
 Chandler:You are going downer!
 Chandler:(almost crying) I wouldn't know I didn't make it! (they hug)
 Chandler:Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
 Chandler:Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
 Chandler:Hey can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me you'll be getting some comedy!
 Chandler:Let me tell you why you need to pick me. (Goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. Rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) See when I was a kid I was always left out of everything you know and it really made me feel... insecure. You know I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway If I'm the only one left out of this wedding I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
 Chandler:(Getting up and raising his fist in victory) Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make groom for Chandler.
 Chandler:How's it going?
 Chandler:(smiling to himself too) That's what I was doing too.
 Chandler:You too.
 Chandler:Me too.
 Chandler:I'm not supposed to tell you.
 Chandler:You told us both we could be in the wedding? (they both stare at Rachel)
 Chandler:Rach Rach knock knock.
 Chandler:I'll tell you at the wedding.
 Chandler:So technically would this person be in the wedding?
 Chandler:I'm not scared. (moves towards Mike and Chappy) I'll just take little Chappy and... (he backs out) HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
 Chandler:(quickly) I'll do it.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Na ha ha... (to Chappy) Ne he he... (Ross moves Chappy to Chandler who quickly backs away) Ah ah...
 Chandler:(to Monica) Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
 Chandler:Oh yeah! (Monica walks outside)
 Chandler:Ready?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
 Chandler:You look beautiful.
 Chandler:That really was an incredible wedding.
 Chandler:I'd love to but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
 Chandler:I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
 Chandler:So where's Mike?
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Why are you wearing my apron?
 Chandler:Oh hey when she gets here is it ok if I introduce you two as my wife and the woman who's carrying my child? (she's not amused) No? Divorce?
 Chandler:Oh those places! There's always so many people their being corralled like cattle and... you know there's always some idiot who goes Mooooo!
 Chandler:I'm so sorry...
 Chandler:Monica. Calm self.
 Chandler:Why would you say that?
 Chandler:Great! (to Monica) This baby'd better to be really good.
 Chandler:(enters the room wearing an I love New York t-shirt a Statue of Liberty hat and carrying bags) New York is awesome!
 Chandler:Yeah I've been to these places before but I've never really seen them you know.
 Chandler:Oh uhm okay uhm do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
 Chandler:That's great.
 Chandler:So what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
 Chandler:I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
 Chandler:Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! (He turns the light on)
 Chandler:Honey it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
 Chandler:I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
 Chandler:I dunno aren't there tests for these things right?
 Chandler:Pff easy for you to say he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says mom on his shovel-wielding arm!
 Chandler:Hey! How was lunch?
 Chandler:(struggling) Oh really?
 Chandler:O-okay. (steps closer to Monica and speaks softly) So is she gonna take the test?
 Chandler:Oh God. It's shovely-Joe isn't it?
 Chandler:How do you know?
 Chandler:Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
 Chandler:(nods in appreciation) Shovely Joe!
 Chandler:Yeah I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
 Chandler:You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah like you wouldn't have done it. (she shrugs)
 Chandler:A dinosaur died a million years ago?
 Chandler:YOU NEVER DID IT!
 Chandler:Hey! I will have you know that... aah who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
 Chandler:Mrs Hannigan?
 Chandler:Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
 Chandler:Yeah come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
 Chandler:Damn it.
 Chandler:That's what we were gonna name the baby.
 Chandler:Hey how'd the interview go?
 Chandler:You know I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
 Chandler:That is a bad interview.
 Chandler:Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
 Chandler:To Ross!
 Chandler:And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said but thank you.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:When your head was hanging out the window it didn't hit a mailbox did it?
 Chandler:Man those two dogs are going at it!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Really? What changed your mind?
 Chandler:Joey there was a little girl who lived here but she died like 30 years ago.
 Chandler:Ha! I'm just messing with you.
 Chandler:You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
 Chandler:It's seven years ago. (he looks surprised) My time machine works!
 Chandler:Excuse me?
 Chandler:For your information I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
 Chandler:How did the job stuff go?
 Chandler:That's great!
 Chandler:How did the job stuff go?
 Chandler:Or facing a bitch of a commute.
 Chandler:My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (Monica looks at him and can't really place what he just said)
 Chandler:Well it makes me feel sad but...
 Chandler:I see.
 Chandler:Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
 Chandler:We close escrow tomorrow so seeing another house can only confuse us and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
 Chandler:What do you think Pheebs?
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:You're kidding!
 Chandler:Oh yeah?
 Chandler:I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
 Chandler:Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown I think we're okay.
 Chandler:It feels like we’re cheating on our house. And if we’re gonna cheat shouldn’t it be with like a hot younger house that does stuff that our house won’t do?
 Chandler:And yet I never run into Beyonce!
 Chandler:(at Janice's punching) Don't don't! (looks disgusted)
 Chandler:(To Monica and with bulging eyes) Why!?
 Chandler:This can not be happening!
 Chandler:The only way that that is going to happen is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
 Chandler:That is a great idea! And by the way I don't mean to sound distasteful but when did you start crapping money!?
 Chandler:Alright alright we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
 Chandler:Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and (apes Janice's voice) Oh My God!
 Chandler:(looks afraid but at the same time knows she's right) Well we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly outside) Oh that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)
 Chandler:The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
 Chandler:Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
 Chandler:Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
 Chandler:I never stopped loving you.
 Chandler:Yeah yeah yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
 Chandler:Now that you live next door we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
 Chandler:(stunned) Obviously.
 Chandler:Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
 Chandler:I understand.
 Chandler:(speaking as in pain) They're never coming down now.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
 Chandler:Where's your passport?
 Chandler:Well it's not.
 Chandler:We're taking a break!
 Chandler:Jumping on the bed?
 Chandler:No no no guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
 Chandler:(holding a pair of furry handcuffs) What the hell is this?
 Chandler:I didn't know Monica had these!
 Chandler:Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:I know she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. (Ross and Joey looks puzzled) I mean... oh forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
 Chandler:Yes Joe?
 Chandler:Oh yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
 Chandler:Oh yeah right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
 Chandler:Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
 Chandler:Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting! (he looks excited)
 Chandler:(he doesn't look excited anymore). Well played.
 Chandler:Uh Rach?
 Chandler:(to Rachel) Uh Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. (shows her the cuffs)
 Chandler:No no no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
 Chandler:Don't say Richard! Well if they're not Monica's and they're not yours then whose are they?
 Chandler:Pheebs!
 Chandler:I think these are yours.
 Chandler:Sure. (to Phoebe) You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
 Chandler:Let me just say something... Because once we get into this I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
 Chandler:Ooh not so tight... (blows raspberry and the hug ends) I'm sorry just give me one more chance.
 Chandler:I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't I can't.
 Chandler:Oh you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
 Chandler:That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
 Chandler:Mine was a humdinger
 Chandler:Well you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
 Chandler:Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
 Chandler:(to Joey) You couldn't be cool. (he goes to the guest bedroom)
 Chandler:Hey Mon I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
 Chandler:Well I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
 Chandler:Monica's grandmother.
 Chandler:Relax! We just get her some antacids.
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Honey it's gonna be okay.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Next time can I say breathe?
 Chandler:Where are you going?
 Chandler:You can't leave me alone with her.
 Chandler:This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
 Chandler:It's just that we've never spent any time you know alone together.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:So ah... Any plans for the summer?
 Chandler:Hah. May not wanna mention this. So you ever wonder which is worse you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
 Chandler:Well it's just interesting. You know because no one will ever know because no one can experience both.
 Chandler:One of life's great unanswerable questions. I mean who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
 Chandler:Is it really that bad?
 Chandler:I'm okay.
 Chandler:Alright. Wow that is one disgusting miracle.
 Chandler:Wow!
 Chandler:(emotional) It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
 Chandler:Well that's spongy.
 Chandler:I know. He has your eyes.
 Chandler:I mean I know that's not possible but he does.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:How do you feel?
 Chandler:Oh yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
 Chandler:Well gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
 Chandler:Interesting! (To Monica) Can I see you for a second?
 Chandler:What do we do?
 Chandler:(panicking) Twins! Twins!!
 Chandler:Uh-huh! Join me won't you?! Okay what do you say we keep one and then just like have an option on the other one?
 Chandler:Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion and then years later they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean that's a great day for everybody.
 Chandler:What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
 Chandler:Monica we are not ready to have two babies!
 Chandler:(smiles) Okay. Shhh...
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:(shocked) She? It's a girl?
 Chandler:(To Monica) Well now we have one of each! (To the doctor) And that's enough!
 Chandler:Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
 Chandler:Bye!
 Chandler:Have fun at church-camp!
 Chandler:I know! You ready to trade?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:We could trade later.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Her name is Erica.
 Chandler:Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
 Chandler:I love you.
 Chandler:I have no idea what's going on but I am excited!
 Chandler:We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift but now we understand you were doing this.
 Chandler:Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
 Chandler:Oh don't worry we'll find them.
 Chandler:Alright.
 Chandler:It's okay it's just an egg roll.
 Chandler:Okay let's find these birds.
 Chandler:Well that can't be good!
 Chandler:How?
 Chandler:Oh tons I'm quite the woodsman.
 Chandler:Joey wait! The ball!
 Chandler:I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
 Chandler:No... It's all glued together.
 Chandler:I don't know. Maybe.
 Chandler:I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
 Chandler:Did that movie ever get made?
 Chandler:And we're also gonna buy you tiny bird hearing-aids.
 Chandler:What's the matter?
 Chandler:I understand.
 Chandler:I don't know. Except that for one last time... (he touches the players as he says the following) Good game good game good game good game good game good game good game.
 Chandler:Well I can't do it either.
 Chandler:We have to bust it open but neither of us can do it!
 Chandler:That was... Impressive.
 Chandler:Sorry about the table man.
 Chandler:You gonna buy a new one?
 Chandler:Well at least we got these little guys out.
 Chandler:Aww we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand huh?
 Chandler:Hey you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
 Chandler:Yeah I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And plus here they'd have their own room.
 Chandler:You know I - I think you're set with the poultry.
 Chandler:I think there may be another reason. So awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
 Chandler:Wow this is weird.
 Chandler:Where's Ross?
 Chandler:(to his children) Look around you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place filled with love and laughter. But more important because of rent control it was a friggin' steal!
 Chandler:Oh okay.
 Chandler:Oh it's gonna be okay.
 Chandler:Sure. Where?
 Chandler:Yeah I think for us kissing is pretty much like an opening act y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
 Chandler:The problem is though after the concert's over no matter how great the show was you girls are always looking for the comedian again y'know? I mean we're in the car we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
 Chandler:Oh I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
 Chandler:Oh uh that would be mine. See I wrote a note to myself and then I realised I didn't need it so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead.
 Chandler:Yes and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
 Chandler:(looking out the window) Ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew!
 Chandler:Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
 Chandler:You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
 Chandler:...Dinah?
 Chandler:Now Monica you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
 Chandler:Boys? We're going in.
 Chandler:Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective huh Mon?
 Chandler:I mean presumably the biggest part of your job is done.
 Chandler:What does she do?
 Chandler:Well no although I did have an imaginary friend who... my parents actually preferred.
 Chandler:I dunno but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
 Chandler:Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
 Chandler:Yeah it's like when you're a kid and your parents put your dog to sleep and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
 Chandler:So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?
 Chandler:Hey that was really good!
 Chandler:Okay. So. Whaddya want from me Damone huh?
 Chandler:Smoke away.
 Chandler:I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
 Chandler:Relax your hand!
 Chandler:Not so much!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Alright now try taking a puff.
 Chandler:Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
 Chandler:It's fine it's fine. Look do you wanna get this part or not? Here.
 Chandler:Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it you feel right. You feel complete.
 Chandler:Nah not so much. Alright now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.)
 Chandler:Oh Satan's minions at work again...
 Chandler:I'm smoking. I'm smoking I'm smoking.
 Chandler:And this- is my reward!
 Chandler:Okay so this time I won't quit!
 Chandler:All right! I'm putting it out I'm putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe's coffee.)
 Chandler:What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
 Chandler:Oh yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties right? (Does the impression)
 Chandler:Yep we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
 Chandler:I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
 Chandler:Well maybe it's a contest y'know? Like collect all five?
 Chandler:Hey this is so unfair!
 Chandler:So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica with that snort when she laughs? I mean what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws why can't you accept me for this?
 Chandler:Hey y'know I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is smoking is cool and you know it.
 Chandler:Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey buddy what's up! Oh she told you about that huh. Well yeah I have one now and then. Well yeah now. Well it's not that big- ..well that's true.. Gee y'know no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well okay thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)
 Chandler:Ooh Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
 Chandler:Joey ate my last stick of gum so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
 Chandler:(deadpan) Ooh I'm alive with pleasure now.
 Chandler:(sarcastic) Oh she's sorry! I feel better!
 Chandler:...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
 Chandler:(leaving) I don't care I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
 Chandler:(returns) Yeah alright.
 Chandler:Uh if I were omnipotent for a day I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
 Chandler:You got waaaay too much free time.
 Chandler:Happy birthday pal!
 Chandler:Well aren't we Mr. The glass is half empty.
 Chandler:Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
 Chandler:(trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon Ross! You me Joey ice guys' night out c'mon whaddya say big guy (Pretending to punch him in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh?
 Chandler:(stops) I have no idea.
 Chandler:You got it.
 Chandler:(looking) Oh this is not that bad.
 Chandler:...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes it to Joey.)
 Chandler:We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
 Chandler:Yes Bunny?
 Chandler:(to Joey) Could've been a peach.
 Chandler:What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
 Chandler:(to Ross) See buddy that's all you need a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
 Chandler:He's open!
 Chandler:Hey look we're on that TV thing!
 Chandler:(to the receptionist)'Scuse me.
 Chandler:Listen it's kind of an emergency. Well I guess you know that or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
 Chandler:Excuse me look we've been here for over an hour and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks through it in a loud voice.) Oh c'mon Dora don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the waiting room.) Y'know I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back he turns and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-!
 Chandler:Yes the moon the glow the magical feeling you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here please?
 Chandler:Well what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
 Chandler:Then what?
 Chandler:So in your whole life you've only been with one—(He gets a look too)—oh.
 Chandler:I think it's great. Y'know it's sweet it's romantic...
 Chandler:No you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross enters off camera)
 Chandler:Oh I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on admit it! All things considered you had fun tonight.
 Chandler:You gotta do it man.
 Chandler:Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves)
 Chandler:Hello? Oh uh Rachel it's the Visa card people.
 Chandler:Alright. (on phone) Yes this is Rachel.
 Chandler:To the left to the left- aww! (They all collapse)
 Chandler:We can? All right I'm tryin' that.
 Chandler:So Saturday night the big night date night Saturday night Sat-ur-day night!
 Chandler:Not a one.
 Chandler:Oh right right shut up.
 Chandler:No I know but it's just so hard you know? I mean you're sitting there with her she has no idea what's happening and then you finally get up the courage to do it and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
 Chandler:Oh thanks but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
 Chandler:Ooh I hate when my father calls me that.
 Chandler:Oh. Well hold on camper are you sure you've thought this thing through?
 Chandler:It's just you and Rachel just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
 Chandler:Yuh-huh.
 Chandler:Well you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?
 Chandler:Oh and uh the fabric softener?
 Chandler:There you go.
 Chandler:Where are they? Where are they?
 Chandler:It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
 Chandler:Here we go.
 Chandler:Hey Janice.
 Chandler:Hey that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here please?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:(covering) What... did you get me there?
 Chandler:Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
 Chandler:That's great.
 Chandler:Well I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
 Chandler:That's it?
 Chandler:Oh yeah that hug looked pretty brutal.
 Chandler:Janice. Hi Janice. Ok here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
 Chandler:Here's the thing Janice. You know I mean it's like we're different. I'm like the bing bing bing. You're like the boom boom (Chandler flails his hand out and hits Janice in the eye)... boom.
 Chandler:Oh my god I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
 Chandler:(to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
 Chandler:Oh I don't know a million?
 Chandler:I'm fine.
 Chandler:I'm not fine. Here she comes.
 Chandler:How do you do that?
 Chandler:We should always always break up together.
 Chandler:I'm free! I'm free!
 Chandler:You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice no fear no sense of impending doom...
 Chandler:(staring at a woman across the room) Ross ten o'clock.
 Chandler:No ten o'clock.
 Chandler:(sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight nine ten o'clock!
 Chandler:She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short fat bald men!
 Chandler:Oh yeah and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
 Chandler:Oh please could she be more out of my league? Ross back me up here.
 Chandler:Thank you buddy.
 Chandler:Y'think?
 Chandler:Oh God I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
 Chandler:Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)
 Chandler:Hi.... um... okay next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name and uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.
 Chandler:Yes yes I did but what I didn't say was what I was about to say what I wanted to say was uh... would you like to go out with me sometime thankyou goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.)
 Chandler:(running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora and she's Italian and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh listen the usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)
 Chandler:Hey kids.
 Chandler:Well I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
 Chandler:It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
 Chandler:Alright. Once I got on the subway right and it was at night and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
 Chandler:We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
 Chandler:Oh I'm sorry so 'we' is?
 Chandler:Who's Rick?
 Chandler:Oh so you're divorced?
 Chandler:Oh I'm sorry then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
 Chandler:So tell me how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
 Chandler:Ethan? There's there's an Ethan?
 Chandler:So explain something to me here uh what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
 Chandler:...Hm.
 Chandler:What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
 Chandler:Well y'know I had some trouble with it at first too but the way I look at it is I get all the good stuff all the fun all the talking all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean this is every guy's fantasy!
 Chandler:Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
 Chandler:Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean she'll scratch your eyes right out.
 Chandler:Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
 Chandler:Oh no it's terrific it's... it's... y'know you deserve this after all your years of struggling you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
 Chandler:Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
 Chandler:C'mon we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom screams and runs back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!
 Chandler:Oh that would be Monica. Hey listen I wanna borrow a coupla things Aurora spent the night I really wanna make her breakfast.
 Chandler:Yeah well I only have twenty minutes until Ethan so y'know.. (He starts to raid the fridge.)
 Chandler:No no resentment believe me it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people so uh.. Monica can you help me with the door? (He has armloads of stuff.)
 Chandler:God I love these fingers...
 Chandler:No actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em look at how happy they are.
 Chandler:Oh no nonononononnononono don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her back down.)
 Chandler:Don't go.
 Chandler:(to himself) Too bad she's leaving.
 Chandler:Well I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
 Chandler:What Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
 Chandler:I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question but- And Andrew is?
 Chandler:Oh so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick Ethan and myself?
 Chandler:Well y'know most women would kill for three guys like us.
 Chandler:You.
 Chandler:Nono just you.
 Chandler:Lose the other guys.
 Chandler:C'mon we're great together why not?
 Chandler:...Well y'know part of me wants that but it's like I'm two guys y'know? I mean one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying y'know 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
 Chandler:I don't know I-I have to listen to both of them they don't exactly let each other finish...
 Chandler:...The second guy.
 Chandler:Sorry the first guy runs the lips.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Big guy?
 Chandler:Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
 Chandler:Oh great. This is just...
 Chandler:Oh my God it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
 Chandler:She's right it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh yeah that is the part to focus on you idiot!
 Chandler:Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
 Chandler:Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill I saw you with some guy last night. Yes he was some guy.
 Chandler:Alright alright alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God do something. Just make contact smile!
 Chandler:There you go!
 Chandler:You're definitely scaring here.
 Chandler:Yeah about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah thanks. (takes phone)
 Chandler:Hey it's me.
 Chandler:Yeah I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
 Chandler:I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
 Chandler:(angry) Put Joey on the phone.
 Chandler:I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
 Chandler:Yeah like that thought never entered my mind.
 Chandler:Um is it sugarless?
 Chandler:Oh then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note If Jill Goodacre offers you gum you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass you take it.
 Chandler:You know on second thought gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him a stick of gum and a strange look) 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice' or 'I'll have a stick' but no no no no. For me gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
 Chandler:(chewing gum) Ah let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm it's impish. Here we go.
 Chandler:Nice going imp. OK it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth.)
 Chandler:Good save! We're back on track and I'm... (grimacing) ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
 Chandler:(gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
 Chandler:OK.
 Chandler:Yes. Yes thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
 Chandler:Hi um I'm account number 7143457. And uh I don't know if you got any of that but I would really like a copy of the tape.
 Chandler:Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
 Chandler:Ah y'see perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent' or 'self-destructive'...
 Chandler:Yes please.
 Chandler:He's a he?
 Chandler:...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
 Chandler:You did?
 Chandler:Huh. Did uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
 Chandler:You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
 Chandler:Well this is fascinating. So uh what is it about me?
 Chandler:Ross is smart and funny d'you ever think that about him?
 Chandler:WHAT IS IT?!
 Chandler:Oh oh a quality good because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
 Chandler:I just have to know okay. Is it my hair?
 Chandler:Hey gorgeous.
 Chandler:No nono don't- don't worry about it. Believe me apparently other people have made the same mistake.
 Chandler:So uh... what do you think it is about me?
 Chandler:...Quality right great.
 Chandler:Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell that's who you saw me with?
 Chandler:Well yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
 Chandler:No! Uh I d'know! The point is if you were gonna set me up with someone I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
 Chandler:Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
 Chandler:Well don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that isn't it?
 Chandler:Nothing just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
 Chandler:You're watching a football game at a funeral?
 Chandler:You are a frightening frightening man.
 Chandler:Oh no-
 Chandler:Hi I'm Chandler and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Who are those people?
 Chandler:Hey Lowell.
 Chandler:So how's it going there in Financial Services?
 Chandler:Good good. Listen heh I dunno what Shelley told you about me but uh... I'm not.
 Chandler:Really.
 Chandler:So- you can tell?
 Chandler:So you don't think I have a a quality?
 Chandler:He is?
 Chandler:Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I wanted to get a Brian I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey Brian.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
 Chandler:That's so funny 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani man slash woman.
 Chandler:Do you know which one you're gonna be?
 Chandler:Good luck man. I hope you get it.
 Chandler:Yes every single one of them.
 Chandler:I thought it was $98.50.
 Chandler:I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact I'd very much like to butter your head.
 Chandler:All right I'm nine years old.
 Chandler:We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
 Chandler:Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
 Chandler:Tonight on a very special Blossom.
 Chandler:Oh you must stop shooping.
 Chandler:No I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
 Chandler:Ok we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing but that's not funny anymore.
 Chandler:The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
 Chandler:No no the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof who's with me?
 Chandler:Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
 Chandler:Do either of you have the keys?
 Chandler:(sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.
 Chandler:Ok Monica only dogs can hear you now so look the door's open. Here we go.
 Chandler:Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
 Chandler:Shall I carve?
 Chandler:Ok who wants light cheese and who wants dark cheese?
 Chandler:I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned but for me this has been really great you know I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway I was just thinking I mean if you'd gone to Vail and if you guys'd been with your family if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be all together you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
 Chandler:Here here!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
 Chandler:That's so funny 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani man slash woman.
 Chandler:Do you know which one you're gonna be?

So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
 Chandler:Here here!
 Chandler:Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
 Chandler:Y'know we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime HBO and Cinemax.
 Chandler:Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty thirty times! No?
 Chandler:Yeah well you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
 Chandler:You can say that because she's not your mom.
 Chandler:Shhh busy beaming with pride.
 Chandler:Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
 Chandler:THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
 Chandler:This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
 Chandler:...And then he burst into flames.
 Chandler:Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
 Chandler:Well I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
 Chandler:I know I am.
 Chandler:Myyy mother ladies and gentlemen.
 Chandler:What are you guys doing out here?
 Chandler:Okay you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside and shuts the door)
 Chandler:Oh my God.
 Chandler:I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:(To Joey) You knew about this?
 Chandler:I spent the entire day with you why didn't you tell me?!
 Chandler:(To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
 Chandler:Y'know of all my friends no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
 Chandler:I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)
 Chandler:I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
 Chandler:You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)
 Chandler:What was that?
 Chandler:Yeah I believe I was talking to Joey alright there Mother-Kisser? (Goes to the counter)
 Chandler:Yes well I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
 Chandler:Because it's complicated it's complex- Hey you kissed my mom!
 Chandler:That's very funny. We done now?
 Chandler:That would be no. Look just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me you can't talk to her.
 Chandler:No just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
 Chandler:You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
 Chandler:Really stupid.
 Chandler:Yeah. No. No...
 Chandler:Yeah okay.
 Chandler:Nice save.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Yeah why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.
 Chandler:Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
 Chandler:Pretty good! I told her.
 Chandler:No-no-no-no we're done.
 Chandler:And we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)
 Chandler:(to Ross) Ah it's just a weekend big deal!
 Chandler:Ok you're going to have to stop that forever!
 Chandler:You think?
 Chandler:Ok so it's just because it was my table I have to buy a new one?
 Chandler:What rule? There's no rule if anything you owe me a table!
 Chandler:Well I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
 Chandler:Well let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
 Chandler:What do you mean like buy it together?
 Chandler:You think we're ready for something like that?
 Chandler:Well it's a pretty big commitment I mean what if one of us wants to move out?
 Chandler:I'm not moving out.
 Chandler:Yeah yeah it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
 Chandler:It's just that we bought a hibachi together and then he ran off and got married and things got pretty ugly.
 Chandler:Aw don't do that
 Chandler:Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)
 Chandler:More coffee over here please!
 Chandler:So what are you gonna do?
 Chandler:Oh yeah you have to tell her.
 Chandler:That's patio furniture!
 Chandler:(gesturing towards another table) What about the birds?
 Chandler:You pick one.
 Chandler:Oh so forget about the birds but big red insects suggest fine dining!
 Chandler:Not like that I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey turns and gives Chandler a dirty look)
 Chandler:So what do you think?
 Chandler:I know!
 Chandler:What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy it's time for you to swoop in!
 Chandler:My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off into the distance. Joey wondering what they are looking at looks in the same direction)
 Chandler:Wha-
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Yeah get out!
 Chandler:(to Joey) One more game?
 Chandler:No-no-no-no we're done.
 Chandler:And we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)
 Chandler:(to Ross) Ah it's just a weekend big deal!
 Chandler:Ok you're going to have to stop that forever!

 Chandler:(to Joey) One more game?
 Chandler:Any contact?
 Chandler:Come on Ross you gotta get back in the game here ok? The Rachel thing's not happening your ex-wife is a lesbian—I don't think we need a third...
 Chandler:I think it's winning.
 Chandler:She'll love it. Go with the egg my friend.
 Chandler:No it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
 Chandler:Oh uh listen about tonight...
 Chandler:Yes I know but her friend sounds like such a...
 Chandler:Yes! Way to go man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg huh?
 Chandler:Oh uh I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok now remember no trading. You get the pretty one I get the mess.
 Chandler:...And what did you bring?
 Chandler:Janice?
 Chandler:(angrily) Hey it's Janice.
 Chandler:Ok I'm makin' a break for it I'm goin' out the window.
 Chandler:Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
 Chandler:I'm sorry I'm sorry you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and yells in his ear) Come on do it do it go come on!!!
 Chandler:That's OK.
 Chandler:(disgusted) What? What can't you do?
 Chandler:Tell me it's you and me we.
 Chandler:Ok you can not do this to me.
 Chandler:I hope she throws up on you.
 Chandler:So...
 Chandler:Oh what a crappy night!
 Chandler:Excuse me. (gets up jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?
 Chandler:Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
 Chandler:You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around it's a man) Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
 Chandler:That's right each. Oh and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always wanted to know...
 Chandler:No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye Janice.
 Chandler:Ok well this was very special.
 Chandler:Janice is gonna go away now.
 Chandler:Oh good Joey's home now.
 Chandler:How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
 Chandler:Oh man. In my next life I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
 Chandler:Hi Just Janice.
 Chandler:Is it loaded? Oh little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and Jan Forever.
 Chandler:Ok Janice. Janice. Hey Janice. Look there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
 Chandler:(surprised) It is?
 Chandler:Oh no you see actually it is.
 Chandler:Oh no I don't.
 Chandler:I did but...
 Chandler:Call me!
 Chandler:Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
 Chandler:Oh listen. If this is about those prank memos I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from the woman.) Nothing.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:So it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
 Chandler:So.... I quit.
 Chandler:Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
 Chandler:If I took this promotion it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
 Chandler:It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
 Chandler:Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
 Chandler:I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
 Chandler:Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
 Chandler:Thanks Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
 Chandler:Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
 Chandler:Well I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman career counselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the a-gogo.
 Chandler:Hey you guys all know what you want to do.
 Chandler:Hey you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
 Chandler:Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
 Chandler:Who are you going out with?
 Chandler:And he's not speaking metaphorically.
 Chandler:Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests intelligence tests personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.
 Chandler:Can you believe it? I mean don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
 Chandler:Ooh you know I had a grape about five hours ago so I'd better split this with you.
 Chandler:(tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...
 Chandler:You know I don't mean to brag but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. (dead silence) Amouz-bouche? (holds out tray)
 Chandler:(smiling)....with??
 Chandler:It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
 Chandler:Again?
 Chandler:(on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? (Listens) Yeah I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home you know? (Listens) Well that's very generous (Listens) er but look this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look Al Al... I'm not playing hardball here OK? This is not a negotiation this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No stop saying numbers! I'm telling you you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you on Monday! (slams the phone down)
 Chandler:Well?
 Chandler:Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)
 Chandler:Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of...
 Chandler:(walks away from window) OK that's enough of the view. Check this out look at this. Sit down sit down.
 Chandler:This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen could you come in here for a moment?
 Chandler:Thank you Helen that'll be all.
 Chandler:Last time I do that I promise.
 Chandler:(on phone) Yes Fran. I know what time it is but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh really really really? Well let me tell you something... you will care about it because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slams phone down then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa....
 Chandler:This is unbelievable. It’s been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon you’d be looking like a ham right about now.
 Chandler:It’s Phoebe! Hi!
 Chandler:Wait wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
 Chandler:Can we start over?
 Chandler:All right now look at her and tell me she doesn’t look exactly like her sister.
 Chandler:They’re twins!
 Chandler:You know that thing when you and I talk to each other about things?
 Chandler:Let’s not do that any more.
 Chandler:Your sister Ursula.
 Chandler:Yeah yeah she works over at that place uh...
 Chandler:Oh you do? Because she said you guys haven’t talked in like years.
 Chandler:Oh and I’ve got Earth Science but I'll catch you in Gym.
 Chandler:And (he imitates the buzzer) to you too Helen.
 Chandler:Oh okay. Send her in.
 Chandler:Hi Nina. Come on in.
 Chandler:Uh Yes. Yes. I’ve just been going over your data here and little thing you’ve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
 Chandler:Well it throws my WENUS out of whack.
 Chandler:WENUS. (Coughs) Weekly Estimated Net...
 Chandler:It’s not just that she’s cute okay. It’s just that... she’s really really cute.
 Chandler:(Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
 Chandler:Hey where you been?
 Chandler:Score.
 Chandler:Yeah listen. Okay before you do anything Joey-like you might wanna run it by err... (he indicates Phoebe who is helping Ross understand the remote control.)
 Chandler:Mr. D how’s it going sir?
 Chandler:And?
 Chandler:So what does this mean?
 Chandler:Hey listen I know I came in late last week but I slept funny and my hair was very very &ndash;
 Chandler:Nina? Nina. (He goes around his desk to where she is sitting.) Nina. (In pain) Nina.
 Chandler:(Looking down at her hand) Yes yes I am. Err listen the reason that I called you in here today was err... please don’t hate me.
 Chandler:(Suddenly bright) Would you like to have dinner sometime?
 Chandler:Well you still haven’t taken down the Christmas lights.
 Chandler:I’m just trying to find the right moment you know?
 Chandler:You know once you’re inside you don’t have to knock any more.
 Chandler:Wow this is serious. I’ve never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
 Chandler:Knit good woman knit knit!
 Chandler:And that’s the Chrysler Building right there.
 Chandler:Yes yes she is. Didn’t I memo you on this? See after I let her go err I got a call from her psychiatrist Dr. Flanen-nen Dr. Flanen Dr. Flan.
 Chandler:And err he informed me that uh she took the news rather badly in fact he uh mentioned the word frenzy.
 Chandler:Oh no no. Nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact if you asked her right now she would have no recollection of being fired at all none at all.
 Chandler:And yet believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself or others.
 Chandler:Well I guess that’s why they call it psychology sir.
 Chandler:You know Ross some scientists are now saying that that monkeys and babies are actually different.
 Chandler:Ah sure Nina. What’s up?
 Chandler:Oh well ah... maybe that’s because they’re ah... jealous of us.
 Chandler:Ah well maybe that’s ah because you’re getting a big raise.
 Chandler:Sure why not?
 Chandler:Oh you don’t know. (Presses a button.) Helen could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder’s raise?
 Chandler:Helen drinks. (Insincerely) Will you marry me?
 Chandler:Well I ended up telling her everything.
 Chandler:Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. (He holds up a bandaged hand.) Little tip if you’re ever in a similar situation never ever leave your hand... (he mimes Nina taking her revenge) ..on the desk.
 Chandler:You’re not gonna lose him.
 Chandler:What are you crazy? That's a baby!
 Chandler:Hey you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
 Chandler:Well only if you order stuff.
 Chandler:There it is! So what're you gonna do?
 Chandler:And your friend Phoebe?
 Chandler:Man if you tried something like that on my birthday you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
 Chandler:Alright what have we learned so far?
 Chandler:(Reading) Happy Birthday Peehe.
 Chandler:Did you see Betty?
 Chandler:Okay worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
 Chandler:Say your son never feels connected to you as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
 Chandler:You know you think I would.
 Chandler:What's up with the simian?
 Chandler:Okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?
 Chandler:No no you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
 Chandler:Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
 Chandler:We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
 Chandler:(Tapping Ross on his shoulder) So you feel like a dad yet?
 Chandler:Hey come on you came through you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
 Chandler:�Pudo aver sido General Tso! (It could've been General Sal!)
 Chandler:Well if you're gonna work for mechanics those are the ones to work for.
 Chandler:You know I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
 Chandler:Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
 Chandler:...little playthings with yarn?
 Chandler:Could you want her more?
 Chandler:(sarcastically) Dee the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
 Chandler:We're not—we're not saying anything.
 Chandler:(to the girls) We were playing poker alright...
 Chandler:And then he did.
 Chandler:There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
 Chandler:(teaching) OK so now we draw cards.
 Chandler:OK Phoebs how many do you want?
 Chandler:(changing subject) OK so at this point the dealer...
 Chandler:OK alright last minute lesson last minute lesson. (holds up two cards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright babe deal the cards.
 Chandler:Rach Rach we gotta settle.
 Chandler:The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see King George is giving us the land so...
 Chandler:Yes and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself but they cost a little less.
 Chandler:Oh did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
 Chandler:Oh come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking) When I play poker I'm not a nice guy!
 Chandler:Um ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
 Chandler:Oh yes yes we could play some other game... like uh I don't know... Pictionary?
 Chandler:That's alright I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
 Chandler:Hey that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
 Chandler:Couldn't be more out. (throws in cards)
 Chandler:Y'know I've had dates like this.
 Chandler:Call.
 Chandler:(to Ross) What do you need what do you need?
 Chandler:Alright here's ten. (gives it to him)
 Chandler:Good luck.
 Chandler:(to Ross) I thought we had them!
 Chandler:Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
 Chandler:Go.
 Chandler:Toootal chick-flick.
 Chandler:They're still just friends right?
 Chandler:I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
 Chandler:I mean don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel they would've happened already?
 Chandler:I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
 Chandler:Hey y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's when that phrase was last used.
 Chandler:Rachel lost Marcel.
 Chandler:Okay it's his first time out so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats you go to the Russian Tea Room.
 Chandler:Marcel?
 Chandler:Marcel?
 Chandler:Um we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
 Chandler:Yes have you seen any?
 Chandler:Oh nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
 Chandler:Yes but these women are very hot and they need our help! And they're very hot.
 Chandler:Okay from now on you don't get to talk to other people.
 Chandler:Marcel?!
 Chandler:Eh. I thought that was an alp.
 Chandler:Yeah well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
 Chandler:I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
 Chandler:I feel violated. And not in a good way.
 Chandler:I am telling you years from now schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves we didn't have to play any games...
 Chandler:Let her know I like her? What are you insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm right right?
 Chandler:Which by the way is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.
 Chandler:No interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase Yes indeedy-o.
 Chandler:(bluffing) And basically that's how a bill becomes a law.
 Chandler:Hey Rach!
 Chandler:Yes!
 Chandler:I have my reasons.
 Chandler:(on phone reading from a script) Oh Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God!
 Chandler:Hey I've been honing!
 Chandler:Oh uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
 Chandler:What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
 Chandler:Can I use your phone?
 Chandler:Yes it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
 Chandler:Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
 Chandler:Ah you obviously saw my personal ad.
 Chandler:She answered.
 Chandler:I'm not gonna talk to her she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God I miss just being needy.
 Chandler:If it helps I could slide over.
 Chandler:Hello? Hello?
 Chandler:So how's Mindy?
 Chandler:Hell is filled with people like you.
 Chandler:...And boogie!
 Chandler:Okay I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
 Chandler:Hey we haven't been on a second date she needs to hear me pee?
 Chandler:I can't call her I left a message! I have some pride.
 Chandler:No! (Calls) Danielle hi! It's uh it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine. Uh listen I don't know if you tried to call me because uh idiot that I am I accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh uh okay that's fine that's great. (Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line she's gonna call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line she's gonna call me back she's on the other line gonna call me back...
 Chandler:'S'why I'm dancing...
 Chandler:Ring dammit ring!
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:(investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God I turned it off!
 Chandler:Nngghhh!!!!!!!
 Chandler:Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody this is Danielle Danielle everybody.
 Chandler:What are you doing here?
 Chandler:...I'm I'm okay.
 Chandler:That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me whatever...
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:...I dunno.
 Chandler:Well she seems very nice and everything but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here just to see if I was okay? I mean... how needy is that?
 Chandler:Wow what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
 Chandler:Well that's what we said about Joey...
 Chandler:How about Joey... Pepponi?
 Chandler:Joey... Switzerland?
 Chandler:Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
 Chandler:Well it does not ring a bell with me...
 Chandler:Might wanna try Joseph.
 Chandler:Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
 Chandler:She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones is she?
 Chandler:So what does this mean?
 Chandler:I don't get it I mean you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
 Chandler:I know that one! ...No that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
 Chandler:Yeah but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean it's a total party zoo.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
 Chandler:...Take off their hats!
 Chandler:You're kidding.
 Chandler:Y'know you'd think I would've.
 Chandler:...He's in.
 Chandler:Okay bye champ. Now I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego but remember there's also a lot to learn.
 Chandler:Tell me what?
 Chandler:(sarcastically) Oh come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
 Chandler:Wow!
 Chandler:More importantly was I any good?
 Chandler:Interesting cause in my dreams I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. (Monica pats him on his lap)
 Chandler:You're okay there?
 Chandler:I'm sorry it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
 Chandler:Hello Rachel.
 Chandler:Pirates again?
 Chandler:(sarcasticly) Thanks Joey that's a good idea.
 Chandler:Well my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It's a whole big boob story.
 Chandler:Well you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
 Chandler:A cool phone number and a possible name for the kid.
 Chandler:When we were?
 Chandler:Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
 Chandler:Can you hear that?
 Chandler:See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
 Chandler:I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Ah!
 Chandler:Well now I actually have to get to work.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Bye bye.
 Chandler:(answering it) Yes?
 Chandler:Ooh. (leans against the desk)
 Chandler:See it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonder what he means) Me.
 Chandler:Why not?
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
 Chandler:What are you talking about?
 Chandler:I can't belive it.
 Chandler:They do me?
 Chandler:I don't sound like that.
 Chandler:Okay I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
 Chandler:That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh shut up!
 Chandler:Oh come on. You told me about the last dream.
 Chandler:Oh why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
 Chandler:And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
 Chandler:Tyrannosaurus!
 Chandler:Work people? Nobody told me.
 Chandler:You know I don't get this. A month ago these people were my friends. You know just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
 Chandler:You think I should?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:I Think last night was great. You know the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Then I don't get it.
 Chandler:They do?
 Chandler:I just wan't to...
 Chandler:But I just wa...
 Chandler:Thanks. Listen about the weekly numbers I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
 Chandler:You have to give 'em something you know. Okay now that was Gerston Santos and who's the guy with the moustache?
 Chandler:Petrie right right. Okay some people gonna be working this weekend.
 Chandler:(doing a little dance) Hey Ross look what I've got going here.
 Chandler:Yeah like in a cab...
 Chandler:Okay hating this.
 Chandler:Here we go here we go.
 Chandler:Yes Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
 Chandler:You have to pick your moments.
 Chandler:I used to have that bumper sticker.
 Chandler:(to Rachel) You see what I mean.
 Chandler:Mmmm. Not tonight honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
 Chandler:Oh ok 'cause we never do that.
 Chandler:You'll get one.
 Chandler:All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40 if neither one of us are married what do you say you and I get together and have one?
 Chandler:Oh no no. I just meant hypothetically.
 Chandler:No no no.
 Chandler:(trapped) Uh uh.
 Chandler:Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
 Chandler:Rachel what is the deal with you and doctors anyway? Was like your father a doctor?
 Chandler:No reason. (turns around makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with his eyes)
 Chandler:Where have you been?
 Chandler:Mazel tov!
 Chandler:(to Joey) You are really frightening me.
 Chandler:Somebody wanna help me tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her hand off of him) Uh that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?
 Chandler:(to nurse) Let me ask you do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
 Chandler:I know I still am one of these.
 Chandler:And sometimes I'll want you to steal third and I'll go like this. (Does a baseball sign.)
 Chandler:Nothing just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks over to where Joey is seated)
 Chandler:Oh yeah right OK... inlcuding the waffles last week you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
 Chandler:(sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)
 Chandler:(in a deep voice) Men are here.
 Chandler:Then put out fire by peeing no get invited back.
 Chandler:Crazy bitch.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Uh let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
 Chandler:Forget about her.
 Chandler:Course there they just call it food.
 Chandler:I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
 Chandler:(sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)
 Chandler:(pointing out a gift) OK this one right here is from me.
 Chandler:Yes the doctors say if they remove it he'll die.
 Chandler:Oh that's Ross's.
 Chandler:Well sure but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel Scrabble game)
 Chandler:Come on Ross? Remember back in college when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
 Chandler:(panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.
 Chandler:(stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
 Chandler:(rubbing his temples) Oh no-no-no-no-no....
 Chandler:No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
 Chandler:OK is there a mute button on this woman?
 Chandler:(quickly) H-He's in China!
 Chandler:What about the time difference?
 Chandler:Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!
 Chandler:Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
 Chandler:Rachel I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)
 Chandler:Hey big...
 Chandler:(quietly) ...spender.
 Chandler:So how'd it go?
 Chandler:The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
 Chandler:Yes I know as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
 Chandler:I didn't know you had another level.
 Chandler:Alright you did it! Do we have any fruit?
 Chandler:Really? So you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
 Chandler: No way!
 Chandler:Yes yes we did thanks to Vidal Buffay.
 Chandler:Ok I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick get the verbs.
 Chandler:Well listen don't tell us what's gonna happen though 'cause I like to be surprised.
 Chandler:Hey Rach can I get...
 Chandler:Not yet.
 Chandler:So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean when last we left you you were totally in love with you know.
 Chandler:God?
 Chandler:Well maybe it was God doing me.
 Chandler:Well you owe me one big guy.
 Chandler:He said...he said he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But the silver lining if you wanna see it is that he made the decision all by himself!  Without any outside help whatsoever.
 Chandler:You have to really wanna see it.
 Chandler:(entering) Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
 Chandler:No no I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
 Chandler:Okay.  You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
 Chandler:Ok I don't care what you guys say something's bothering her.
 Chandler:What stupid thing did you do?
 Chandler:People do stupid things when they're upset.
 Chandler:Well in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension I've got pants that need to be altered.
 Chandler:Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
 Chandler:At least as long as I have the pants.
 Chandler:(entering angry) Yo paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? (Pause) Your tailor is a very bad man!
 Chandler:Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
 Chandler:Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam and he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite...
 Chandler:Cupping.
 Chandler:Come on Monica things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy but it's true.
 Chandler:That's ok.
 Chandler:You know it's... (sees the feeding taking place next to him) something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. (Goes into the kitchen)
 Chandler:We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
 Chandler:Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
 Chandler:So uh how often can you do it?
 Chandler:Hey sweetums.
 Chandler:Come on you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
 Chandler:What did you just do?
 Chandler:What did you just do?
 Chandler:Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
 Chandler:Howdy.
 Chandler:Well maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
 Chandler:(slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
 Chandler:(pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
 Chandler:You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
 Chandler:All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Huh. (They all leave dejected)
 Chandler:Morning.
 Chandler:Yeah like there's any way I could ever do that.
 Chandler:Hey you know what here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
 Chandler:I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
 Chandler:Well maybe I won't kiss you and then you'll have to stay.
 Chandler:Nope not this time.
 Chandler:I'm not yanking you.
 Chandler:Yeah I know. She makes me happy.
 Chandler:(looks him in the eye) I'm not breaking up with her! (they stare at each other for a while then Joey blows in his face)
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Of!
 Chandler:You know you should really go on this show. All right listen I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
 Chandler:No Janice.
 Chandler:You know I may be way out on a limb here but do you do you have a problem with Janice?
 Chandler:Ooh that girl that I hate eww drives me crazy eww eww oh!
 Chandler:Well there you go.
 Chandler:Well I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry those are the right letters.
 Chandler:I want you to say that you like her!
 Chandler:Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
 Chandler:Umm yeah.
 Chandler:Girth? Why why why wh-why why why why would they do this?
 Chandler:We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
 Chandler:Yeah okay.
 Chandler:Yeah! All right! You go first.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
 Chandler:I know!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Okay you know you know when your in bed with a woman.
 Chandler:And ah you know your fooling around with her. And you get all these like mental images in your brain you know like Elle MacPherson or that girl at the Xerox place....
 Chandler:I know And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom get outta here!' You know but of course like after that you can't possibly think of anything else and you can't you know stop what your doing. So it's kinda like you're you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!
 Chandler:You said...
 Chandler:What are you guys doing together?
 Chandler:Really.
 Chandler:You still can't stand her can you?
 Chandler:Well you know I appreciate you giving it a shot.
 Chandler:Well I guess that's something.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Oh God!
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:Taste it.
 Chandler:Yeah I know I did that two minutes ago.
 Chandler:Hey mister tux!
 Chandler:(entering from bathroom with an issue of Cosmo) All right I took the quiz and it turns out I do put career before men. (to Joey) Get up.
 Chandler:You're in my seat.
 Chandler:'Cause I was sitting there.
 Chandler:Well it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom you knew I was coming back.
 Chandler:The big deal is I was sitting there last so that's my seat.
 Chandler:All right Ross I just have to do one thing really quickly it's not a big deal. (yells at Joey) GET UP!!
 Chandler:Well Joey I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.
 Chandler:Really!
 Chandler:Honey you did call him back. 'Cause it's it's really old.
 Chandler:You know what okay fine. Don't get up you just sit right there. I just hope you don't mind you know my hand right here. (holds his hand a couple of inches in front of Joey's face) Op not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! (Joey flings some dip onto Phoebe's dress)
 Chandler:Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
 Chandler:All right fine you know what we'll both sit in the chair. (sits on Joey's lap) I'm soooo comfortable.
 Chandler:All right! (jumps up)
 Chandler:All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair! (leaves)
 Chandler:Maybe it was his sister's. You know maybe it was his daughter's.
 Chandler:All right you will notice that I am fully dressed. I in turn have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne Get out of my chair dillhole!
 Chandler:What are you doing?
 Chandler:The cushions are the essence of the chair!
 Chandler:Oh-ho it'll be back. Oh-ho there's nobody in the room.
 Chandler:We used them as pillows when we went camping.
 Chandler:(shyly) The sheep.
 Chandler:He took my essence!
 Chandler:Well then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
 Chandler:What are you what are you gonna show me my clothes?
 Chandler:He's got nothing!
 Chandler:What are you supporting?
 Chandler:Monica I think you've gone over to the bad place.
 Chandler:(to Phoebe) You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower he always put a towel around his waist. I mean what is that about?
 Chandler:They got a phone in there right?
 Chandler:Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
 Chandler:Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
 Chandler:Oooo-ooh!
 Chandler:Jeez what a baby.
 Chandler:Stop it. Stop it!
 Chandler:Excuse me. Hi.
 Chandler:Well your kind of sitting in my seat.
 Chandler:I mean I was sitting there.
 Chandler:But I never left the room!
 Chandler:All right that's it give me your underwear.
 Chandler:(going to the bedroom) See Joe that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Well I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
 Chandler:Because the kids need new shoes.
 Chandler:Do I look fat?
 Chandler:Okay I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
 Chandler:Okay well. Janice said 'Hi do I look fat today?' And I I looked at her....
 Chandler:Okay so you both just know this stuff?
 Chandler:That's easy baggage claim.
 Chandler:Okay this is good this is good. All right listen I have one. Janice likes to cuddle at night which you know I'm all for. But uh you know when you want to go to sleep you want some space. So uh how do I tell her that without you know accidentally calling her fat or something.
 Chandler:Thank you Rachel.
 Chandler:Well I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
 Chandler:Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Okay the old hug and roll.
 Chandler:Okay one question.
 Chandler:You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
 Chandler:Umm not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
 Chandler:Hey Joe I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds up one hand) or or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)
 Chandler:Well your gonna need much bigger jars.
 Chandler:That that's what's stupid.
 Chandler:Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'Look at all that room on her side you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay hug and roll time. I'm huggin' I'm huggin' your rollin' and....yes! Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay time for the old table cloth trick one fluid motion. Quick like a cat quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!' (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)
 Chandler:No that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
 Chandler:You mean there's more than one of us.
 Chandler:And that's how you bought it?
 Chandler:Pheebs wake up and smell the restraining order.
 Chandler:Sure. What's up?
 Chandler:You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
 Chandler:Well it's official there are no good movies.
 Chandler:Hey man. What's up?
 Chandler:Well I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt but ah it wasn't me.
 Chandler:Is anybody else scared?
 Chandler:Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
 Chandler:(entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
 Chandler:Just do it! Okay it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
 Chandler:Okay last night at dinner when the meals came she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
 Chandler:Noo.
 Chandler:No it's like all of the sudden we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
 Chandler:I know that (looks at her fake chest and loses his train of thought temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
 Chandler:Look what do I do? I wanna get past this I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel to the other side!
 Chandler:Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do we have any thoughts here?
 Chandler:You think?
 Chandler:Yeah Joe I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
 Chandler:'Cause I wanted to uh give you this. (hands her a present)
 Chandler:Well wait there's there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
 Chandler:Yes I did. Yes I did. Because you're my girlfriend and that's what girlfriends should should get.
 Chandler:Well not me. But that's what's happened and ah and and there's more. We should take a trip.
 Chandler:Yep we're a couple and that's what couples do. And I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
 Chandler:I am I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
 Chandler:It doesn't scare me!
 Chandler:Oh no no no don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless and awkward and desperate for love!! (Janice leaves Chandler then calls Janice to leave a message on her machine) Hey Janice! It's me. Um yeah I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)
 Chandler:So I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
 Chandler:Then I got all needy and clingy.
 Chandler:She said she'd call me.
 Chandler:Oh God.
 Chandler:This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
 Chandler:So you don't think I'm terminal?
 Chandler:Okay okay. So should I call her?
 Chandler:So I'm not not gonna lose her?
 Chandler:I said 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
 Chandler:(in a British accent) Hello Janice.
 Chandler:(in accent) Oh just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
 Chandler:(normal voice) No. Not anymore.
 Chandler:Yeah huh. I'm just uh you know I'm just picking up some things for a party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)
 Chandler:Well I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
 Chandler:Here in Chelsea.
 Chandler:A woman's
 Chandler:(shyly) Chelsea.
 Chandler:Can I be that guy?
 Chandler:....And then I just you know threw the bag of barley at her and ran out of the store.
 Chandler:I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now right?
 Chandler:(answering phone) Hello. Hi Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay what do I do?
 Chandler:Hello!
 Chandler:What are you stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello Janice. Hi I'm so glad that you called I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And it's just because I'm crazy about you and I just got...stupid and and scared and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. (listens) Really?! (listens) Really?!

 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:You’re building a post office?
 Chandler:Okay. (notices that Joey is wearing some really tight jeans) My word! Those are snug.
 Chandler:Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
 Chandler:All right Janice likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
 Chandler:Well we have a deal where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with and the other one can’t get mad.
 Chandler:Ah Kim Basinger Cindy Crawford Halle Berry Yasmine Bleeth and ah Jessica Rabbit.
 Chandler:I know I know I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
 Chandler:Peter Parker.
 Chandler:(coughing) What a geek!
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:We don’t really.
 Chandler:You know we don’t really take advantage of living in the city.
 Chandler:No you didn’t get me!! It’s an electric drill you get me you kill me!!
 Chandler:I do NOT want this unit!!
 Chandler:Fine! (goes into his room and slams the door then he slams the bottom half of the door.)
 Chandler:All right so who do you got it narrowed down to?
 Chandler:Oooh-hoo very attractive forgiving.
 Chandler:Eh y'know what she’s to political she probably wouldn’t let you do it unless you donated four cans of food first.
 Chandler:Ooh-hoo. Very hot very sexy. But ah y'know she’s too international y'know she’s never gonna be around.
 Chandler:So you gotta play the odds pick somebody who’s gonna be in the country like all the time.
 Chandler:(entering) Have you seen Joey?
 Chandler:Oh just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of his pants.) Y’know what it’s my fault really because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
 Chandler:What’s going on?
 Chandler:Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
 Chandler:He started mine first!
 Chandler:What like a number?
 Chandler:Hi! Bye! (runs to the bathroom)
 Chandler:Okay on three. One....Two....
 Chandler:Why two?
 Chandler:Yeah I coulda counted to three like four times without all this ‘two’ talk.
 Chandler:Okay one...two...
 Chandler:Oh good job Joe.
 Chandler:Yeah-yeah so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
 Chandler:Yeah y'know what I got a better idea. How-how ‘bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move it but it doesn’t move.)
 Chandler:Umm?
 Chandler:I’ve got five bucks says you can’t.
 Chandler:Oh I think I have the cash.
 Chandler:Yeah you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so that the doors won’t open) I’m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack between the door and frame) Here you go.
 Chandler:(entering with a goatee) Hey.
 Chandler:I’m never gonna find a roommate ever.
 Chandler:Well let’s see there was the guy with the ferrets that’s plural. The spitter. Oh-ho and yes the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing Bing!
 Chandler:Two. This photographer who seemed really dull. And this actor guy who I’m not sure about because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa short message.’
 Chandler:Umm how’s it going with you guys?
 Chandler:Soo ah Eric what kind of photography do ya do?
 Chandler:Yes that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
 Chandler:Well listen I ah still have one more person to ah meet but unless it turns out to be your sister I think you’re chances are pretty good. (Eric offers to shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)
 Chandler:(running around the apartment pointing out things) Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen and thanks for coming by (opens door) Bye-bye.
 Chandler:Sure. Ummm. What’s up?
 Chandler:What gay thing?
 Chandler:Well okay Jerry thanks for stopping by.

 Chandler:You betcha!
 Chandler:Um-mm yeah right!
 Chandler:Oh yes and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
 Chandler:Okay but after that we’re shootin’ some pool.
 Chandler:Excuse I seem to have dropped my ball.
 Chandler:(picks it up) And now I’ve picked it up again. (walks over to Monica.)
 Chandler:(leaving to go to work) Hey!
 Chandler:Oh don’t thank me thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay I gotta get to get to work.
 Chandler:So ah whatcha watching?

 Chandler:Do you have any beers? We’re out of beers.
 Chandler:You okay?
 Chandler:Right.
 Chandler:Noo!! You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t I don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
 Chandler:Oh-ho come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known in real life.
 Chandler:Umm this is nice.
 Chandler:No I mean it this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
 Chandler:Anyway I should go one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
 Chandler:Oh yeah that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh and listen it’s it’s gonna be....
 Chandler:Ross-Joey Joey-Ross. (they shake hands)
 Chandler:I can’t believe you came back.
 Chandler:If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible that would be the best.
 Chandler:(to Janice) Don’t look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
 Chandler:What a wank!
 Chandler:(leaning in) I’ll go.
 Chandler:See that’s why I could never be an actor. Because I can’t say gig.
 Chandler:Knock knock.
 Chandler:Hey I’m going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the bed) Whoa-whoa somebody missed the off ramp.
 Chandler:Okay. (to Monica) It’s a racecar.
 Chandler:Okay well it this bed isn’t new how come there is plastic on the mattress?
 Chandler:You told him to play the boxer gay!!
 Chandler:You totally screwed him over.
 Chandler:Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin’! (honks the bed’s little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops) All right I’ll leave. My bed’s so boring.
 Chandler:I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)
 Chandler:Okay I’m not gonna have one.
 Chandler:All right I’ll have one. (he and Ross take another brownie)
 Chandler:See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
 Chandler:That is so weird because every time I go to the dentist I look down the hygienist’s blouse.
 Chandler:Hey! Hold on a minute hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
 Chandler:Janice’s birthday is coming up I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
 Chandler:That’s a good idea ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday’. I would like to get her something serious.
 Chandler:All right. Look I’m gonna go in here and you don’t buy me anything ever. (starts to go into the store)
 Chandler:Why not?!
 Chandler:What is the thing?
 Chandler:(shocked) What?
 Chandler:Well she she wouldn’t do that she’s with she’s with me.
 Chandler:Yeah well you’re wrong! Okay you’re wrong.
 Chandler:Ah I don’t know you tell me. Anything you ah wanna tell me because if you ah you should if you you would tell me.
 Chandler:You tell me! Maybe it’s because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no no-no-no-no that was you!!
 Chandler:All right!
 Chandler:Joey told me he saw you two kissing.
 Chandler:No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
 Chandler:Wh-wh-why wh-why why why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
 Chandler:(giving her a bag) Here.
 Chandler:I’ll take it! All right look I gotta know. Are you finished with me? (Janice shakes her head no) Are you finished with him? (Janice shakes her head no) Do you still love him? (Janice shakes her head yes) Do you still love me? (Janice shakes her head yes) All right look (grabs the bag) I’m gonna need an actual answer here okay so which is it him or me? (his phone starts to ring)
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:All right.
 Chandler:I talked to Janice.
 Chandler:She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can’t even return them because she choked on the reciept!
 Chandler:I don’t know y'know. What what would you do?
 Chandler:Come on tell me.
 Chandler:What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you what are you talking about?
 Chandler:Janice I have something I need to tell you and I want you to let me get through it because it’s it’s it’s not gonna be easy.
 Chandler:I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guy that breaks up a family y'know when my parents split up it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason you are the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matter how nice he was or how happy he made my Dad.
 Chandler:Yeah well. It’s the right thing to do.
 Chandler:Then don’t leave me!
 Chandler:Forget what I said I was babbling! Pick me!
 Chandler:No you don’t! No no no I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
 Chandler:Ohhh. Don’t go.
 Chandler:No. No! No! No!
 Chandler:I don’t care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I don’t care!!
 Chandler:You can’t leave! I have your shoe!
 Chandler:(singing) I’ll hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe enters) I can’t resist your charms. And love....
 Chandler:(high pitched) No you know I don’t mind.
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:I’ve found.
 Chandler:No no no I don’t I don’t really wanna play.
 Chandler:That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that I don’t have goals!
 Chandler:Yeah all right I’ll play.
 Chandler:No no no you say that proudly.
 Chandler:And was the curse lifted?
 Chandler:But wait a minute though how are we gonna get there though because my Mom won’t let me cross the street.
 Chandler:And then Tineals.
 Chandler:Wow! Just like in the pros.
 Chandler:The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball but kicks Ross’s foot instead.)
 Chandler:Sorry. I’m sorry. Y'know what we’re just gonna throw it.
 Chandler:No no no actually losers rhyme.
 Chandler:(coming up under center just like a real quarterback does and puts his hands between Ross’s legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and looks at him) You wanna go shotgun?
 Chandler:(from the shotgun) Hike!
 Chandler:Great! Now the score is 7 to almost 7.
 Chandler:No no no no no!
 Chandler:(running up) Hey Joey do you wanna play football or you wanna.. (sees Marhan) Hi I’m Chandler.
 Chandler:Mar-haaaan.
 Chandler:Well that went well.
 Chandler:Y'know I was thinking about ah asking her for her number.
 Chandler:Whoa-ho whoa! No I was thinking about y'know for me as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
 Chandler:Thanks. What let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn’t I wouldn’t have a shot?
 Chandler:Math!! You’re giving me math! All right look y'know what forget about it you go for the girl we’ll see who gets her.
 Chandler:Well now you have two. Hey I am good at math.
 Chandler:Hey! Well I’ve been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that’s mean!
 Chandler:Before!!
 Chandler:Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
 Chandler:Okay good.
 Chandler:(to Margha) Hi.
 Chandler:No-no-no-no the game’s not over we’re just switching teams.
 Chandler:No ah hold on a second Joe where do Dutch people come from?
 Chandler:And the other ah Dutch people they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands right?
 Chandler:Fine with me.
 Chandler:Yes!!
 Chandler:Well you don’t you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
 Chandler:You hear that! That is her chose mister I’ll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)
 Chandler:Wh-what?
 Chandler:Y'know what it doesn’t matter ‘cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready Set Cook!
 Chandler:We’re not gonna lose to girls.
 Chandler:Okay okay so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
 Chandler:Hey-hey-hey Rachel funny thing. Actually the ah end zone starts at that pole so you’re five feet short so we win!
 Chandler:Guys! Guys! Come on! It’s Thanksgiving it’s not important who wins or loses. The important thing is (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you Amsterdam! Good night!!
 Chandler:Yes. Yes there is they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
 Chandler:(reading the comics) Eh... I don’t I don’t know.
 Chandler:Well as old as he is in dog years do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
 Chandler:(thinks about it) Yeah?
 Chandler:Excuse me little one I have a very solid backhand.
 Chandler:I was shrieking... like a Marine.
 Chandler:(reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?
 Chandler:Look out kids he’s coming! (Ross continues to leave with his head down in shame.)
 Chandler:Yes. Yes and ah ah the trees are happy too because for most of them it’s the only chance to see New York.
 Chandler:Ahh do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
 Chandler:How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what two years ago?
 Chandler:He’s right if you quit this job you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
 Chandler:Because I’m too afraid.
 Chandler:Yeah that’d be much worse than being 28 and still working here.
 Chandler:(to Joey) Does this mean we’re gonna have to start paying for coffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)
 Chandler:I spelled out boobies.
 Chandler:So how many have you sold so far?
 Chandler:Oh my God how did you do that?
 Chandler:Me! On my computer.
 Chandler:Eh yeah well ah waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
 Chandler:Something else I might have said?
 Chandler:You-you-you don’t wanna give into the fear.
 Chandler:Run Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)
 Chandler:Tell us what happened Brown Bird Ross.
 Chandler:(to Rachel who’s entering) Hey! How’d the interview go?
 Chandler:Y'know what Rach maybe you should just y'know stay here at the coffee house.
 Chandler:Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself really perked up my Christmas.
 Chandler:It’s like ‘Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.’
 Chandler:Sure everybody loves a kidder.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Should I tell her I ordered tea?
 Chandler:I’m an alien. I’m an alien.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
 Chandler:I just saw Janice.
 Chandler:Yeah she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them.
 Chandler:Yes but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
 Chandler:Oh y'know what I’m gonna be okay you don’t have to throw a party for me.
 Chandler:Oh well then if anybody should have a party it should be him.
 Chandler:Okay well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know it’s supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
 Chandler:Hello-dillillio!!
 Chandler:(to Monica) Take off your shirt!
 Chandler:Yeah Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
 Chandler:(to Monica) Okay how many of that girl are you seeing?
 Chandler:Hi Joey’s sisters!
 Chandler:Oh I’m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
 Chandler:No-no-no-no no it’s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can’t we savor the precious moments? (to one of Joey’s sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.
 Chandler:Well my apartment isn’t there anymore because I drank it.
 Chandler:Yeah I ended up in the storage room and not alone.
 Chandler:Ow no ‘woo-hooing’ no ‘woo-hooing.’
 Chandler:Ah I fooled around with Joey’s sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well that’s not the worst part.
 Chandler:I can’t remember which sister.
 Chandler:Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?
 Chandler:(to Monica) You see you can’t tell which one is which either dwha!!
 Chandler:Veronica. Look it’s got to be Veronica the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
 Chandler:Look when I’ve been drinking sometimes I tend to get overly friendly and I’m sorry.
 Chandler:Why can’t we talk in here? With with witnesses.
 Chandler:It’s gotta be the first one.
 Chandler:Yep I’m in a tree.
 Chandler:Well that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I’ll be in Cuba.
 Chandler:What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
 Chandler:(shocked) Joey what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
 Chandler:I’m here to see Mary-Angela.
 Chandler:Where’s Mary-Angela?
 Chandler:This teramisu is is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
 Chandler:Well it’s it’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
 Chandler:So um Mary-Angela what’s your second favorite?
 Chandler:Would you just please....give me the receipt ‘cause this is great. It’s top notch.
 Chandler:So will I.
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn’t mean anything.
 Chandler:Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)
 Chandler:(startled) Hey!
 Chandler:Look I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him but he ducks it and moves away) Um I just got out of a relationship and I’m not really in a in a commitment kind of place.
 Chandler:Ahhhh you’re not Mary-Angela.
 Chandler:This is so bad. If-if you’re not Mary-Angela then-then who is?
 Chandler:Oh this is soo bad. (doesn’t see Mary-Angela)
 Chandler:No Joey! No Joey! Don’t Joey! Joey!
 Chandler:(pats him on the shoulder) You’re it! Now run and hide!
 Chandler:I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey’s sisters gasp) Look I’m sorry okay I was really drunk and you all look really similar.
 Chandler:Y'know what we should all calm down because your brother’s not going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?
 Chandler:Joey if you wanna punch me go ahead I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
 Chandler:Okay absolutely!
 Chandler:You’ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister’s but he still doesn’t know which one is Mary-Angela.)
 Chandler:What?! (Cookie punches him)
 Chandler:Don’t worry.
 Chandler:Oh yeah but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
 Chandler:All right I suppose I can wait a day. Hey what are you doing Friday?
 Chandler:I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert y'know he's the botanist.
 Chandler:Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
 Chandler:(to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Hey so can you make it on Friday?
 Chandler:Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
 Chandler:Well if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks then all right.
 Chandler:Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! (pause) Don't cry outloud.
 Chandler:I want to say you but that seems like such an easy answer.
 Chandler:I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
 Chandler:The abridgment.
 Chandler:....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
 Chandler:Oh no no no no.
 Chandler:All right I have to get that but no-no. (answering phone) Hello? (listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen I'm I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. (listens) Let me ask you this what what do you do for the extra hundred? (listens) So would I would I have to provide the grapes?
 Chandler:Okay we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
 Chandler:To yourself. (finishing) Hey-hey-hey y'know what that's pretty good.
 Chandler:Bye-bye.
 Chandler:What what what?!
 Chandler:You really think that is what he meant?
 Chandler:Look don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
 Chandler:Well why don't you send her a musical bug op no you already did that. All right look you're going to have to go there yourself now okay make a few surprise visits.
 Chandler:All right fine don't do anything just sit here and talk to us meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me because he understands me.'
 Chandler:He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
 Chandler:Oh yeah yeah! Look what I got look what I got. (holds up a pen) See she's fully dressed right?
 Chandler:And then you click it and uh-oh she's naked. And then and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman she's walking down the street she's window shopping and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa sh-she's naked! (Rachel just stares at him.)
 Chandler:Y'know what I'm I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
 Chandler:Oh okay Ross. Listen this pen is kinda getting boring so can you pick me up some porn?
 Chandler:Man I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing)
 Chandler:Yeah. Either that or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
 Chandler:Yeah baby!
 Chandler:Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
 Chandler:Well she spent the last six months getting over him and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.
 Chandler:Oh hey.
 Chandler:(to Robert) So ah isn’t a bit cold out for shorts?
 Chandler:Right right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
 Chandler:(standing up) I’m up! I’m up I’ve gotten up now! Anybody ah want anything?
 Chandler:Okay Ross why don’t you come with me?
 Chandler:Robert’s coming out.
 Chandler:No. He.....he’s coming out of his shorts.
 Chandler:The man is showing brain.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Wellll?
 Chandler:What do we do? What do we do?
 Chandler:Like an eclipse.
 Chandler:Your liking it huh?
 Chandler:No actually Laurie’s a boy.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:You mean a three pointer?
 Chandler:I’m sorry I’m sorry it just seems that Robert isn’t as concealed in the shorts area as ah one may have hoped.
 Chandler:Stretchy pants! Why those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day every day!
 Chandler:Hmmm that’s very cool.
 Chandler:I can’t believe she cracked your code!
 Chandler:No Beth doesn’t die she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?
 Chandler:We can’t tell him you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
 Chandler:Yeah we got um-hmm.
 Chandler:I like her.
 Chandler:Well that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from these people.
 Chandler:(to Ross) All right listen I have to go to the bathroom but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I’d like know whether that’s several big fish or just one big fish.
 Chandler:No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called ‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’
 Chandler:Jeez man did you fall..(sees it’s a beautiful woman coming out of the men’s room) Hi! So ah did ya did-did-did ya fall high?
 Chandler:(to Gunther) Y'know what Gunther go ah go ahead I’m-I’m talking to ah (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) This is the part where you say your name.
 Chandler:Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger so....
 Chandler:Nope nope I’d just ah I’d rather talk to you. (pause) Yes I do. Yes I do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)
 Chandler:Well that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve ever met in a men’s room.
 Chandler:(sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op foot in a puddle foot all in a puddle.
 Chandler:Yeah we’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
 Chandler:No really you’re gonna freeze.
 Chandler:You’re not what do you what do you got a bionic foot?
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half stole my car.
 Chandler:Great. It was great. She’s ah she’s great great looking great personality she’s greatness.
 Chandler:Joey told you about the leg huh?
 Chandler:Oh God it freaked me out. Okay I know it shouldn’t have but it did. I mean I like her I don’t want to stop seeing her but every so often it’s like ‘Hey y'know what where’s your leg?’ I mean I’m the smallest person in the world aren’t I? I’m the smallest person in the world.
 Chandler:(to Monica) Actually he’s the smallest person in the world.
 Chandler:It came up.
 Chandler:No. No. Actually I forgot what is the deal with that again?
 Chandler:No. No. I don’t think so.
 Chandler:That’s-that’s my nubbin.
 Chandler:It’s kinda a ah a third nipple kinda thing.
 Chandler:Well y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... (starts to kiss her again but she gets up.) Ahh what?
 Chandler:You ah you have you have to leave now? How come?
 Chandler:(entering happily) Well hello!
 Chandler:The doctor.
 Chandler:Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples no waiting.
 Chandler:That was an obvious joke and I didn’t think of it. Why didn’t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God what have I done!
 Chandler:(entering) Hey does anybody need anything copied? I’m going down to the Xerox place.
 Chandler:Okay listen just give me anything I can make two of.
 Chandler:Yeah! You wanna come?
 Chandler:Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
 Chandler:Uh-oh.
 Chandler:(to Joey) Okay that hurt us.
 Chandler:Well ah ........y'know.
 Chandler:All right rock on. (Does the ‘Hang 10’ sign then hides his face in shame.)
 Chandler:Hey y'know what maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
 Chandler:What time is it now?
 Chandler:Yeah all right so we’ll hang out.
 Chandler:Yes. Vividly.
 Chandler:Yeah I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah I-I think so...
 Chandler:Yeah. Yeah I mean what what would we do?
 Chandler:She was kidding.
 Chandler:She was.... But y'know what just in case maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
 Chandler:Yeah. Good call nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed and and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab something with his hand.)
 Chandler:Right. Right. Well ah y'know we could flip for it.
 Chandler:Well it you don’t know that then I don’t want to do this with you.
 Chandler:And that’s the only colour that comes in.
 Chandler:So what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
 Chandler:Hey no way! Come on this is you guys call her and work it out.
 Chandler:Hey this isn’t like swimming after you eat pick up the phone!!
 Chandler:Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
 Chandler:Why? What happened to him?
 Chandler:Oh my God! Oh my God!
 Chandler:Well before we answer that I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
 Chandler:He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit and you’re just gonna hurt her.
 Chandler:All right look if you absolutely have to tell her at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.
 Chandler:Okay okay-okay ah Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail I did it!
 Chandler:Off?!!
 Chandler:Yeah well I don’t think you can make that statement unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
 Chandler:Oh that’s mature.
 Chandler:Nothing nothing.
 Chandler:Yeah well I guess they had a fight and he got drunk....
 Chandler:(to Joey) He has sex and we get hit in our heads.
 Chandler:Uh-oh.
 Chandler:She was not good. Not good.
 Chandler:Uh-oh.
 Chandler:Yeah never cheat on Rachel.
 Chandler:Y'know what I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
 Chandler:(handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut we’re never leaving ever.
 Chandler:Oh great food with hair on it.
 Chandler:Because that would be crazy?
 Chandler:Yeah come on it’s Ross and Rachel they’ve got too.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Are you actually saying these words?
 Chandler:Let’s go.
 Chandler:(to Joey) Is that your new walk?
 Chandler:This is the New York Times.
 Chandler:We are. He’s meeting us here.
 Chandler:Yeah y-you how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
 Chandler:Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
 Chandler:Y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay I mean it’s been a week.
 Chandler:No.
 Chandler:Yes yes it’s just that we ah we kinda all ready made plans with Ross.
 Chandler:Yeah he’s really excited about it too he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
 Chandler:(jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!
 Chandler:Well actually yesterday I was smoking again. Today I’m I’m smoking still.
 Chandler:Look I’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce which is when I started smoking in the first place.
 Chandler:Yeahhh. I’m tellin’ ya something that ah first smoke after nap time....
 Chandler:Oh that’s great with my luck that’s gonna be him.
 Chandler:Nope hymn 253 His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and it’s Rachel again.)
 Chandler:Hey shut up!! You’re not my real Mom!!
 Chandler:Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
 Chandler:Well then I might as well offer to stay.
 Chandler:(to Joey) Well he’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Beam me up Jesus.
 Chandler:Okay well then I-I have to go to the bathroom.
 Chandler:Oh come on there’s a rest stop right up there! Come on I really have to goooooooooo.
 Chandler:Here we go. Okay brace yourselves.
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no-no-no-no!!
 Chandler:(to Joey) My lighter’s in there! (points to the cab)
 Chandler:Damn! (stands up) The tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this!
 Chandler:Oh I do! Op no wait a minute I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
 Chandler:Ladies ladies let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe Rachel take off Monica’s bra.
 Chandler:Well I thought if I littered that crying Indian might come by and save us.
 Chandler:Okay now let’s decide who has the nicest ass.
 Chandler:At least let me smoke it to the good part.
 Chandler:I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another cigarette.)
 Chandler:Well it’s very unsettling.
 Chandler:Oh no now it’s not gonna make any sense!
 Chandler:Oh this is horrible it’s just horrible.
 Chandler:It’s horrible.
 Chandler:Y'know what I can handle it handle’s my middle name. Actually it’s the ah middle part of my first name.
 Chandler:Guys guys guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to stop the fighting.)
 Chandler:I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
 Chandler:Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:No-no why don’t you hang on to that one.
 Chandler:Okay that’s like the least fun game ever.
 Chandler:Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking patch and it falls off.) Nope that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake laughs.)
 Chandler:Or what my Father called Thursday night.
 Chandler:Y'know I would’ve bet good money that he’d be the first one of us to get married.
 Chandler:Always illegal Joe.
 Chandler:If that doesn’t keep kids in school what will?
 Chandler:(entering carrying a briefcase) Hi.
 Chandler:Y'know I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
 Chandler:Y'know what pretty good.
 Chandler:Good! I haven’t smoked yet today I feel great and-and-and confident that is a stunning blouse.
 Chandler:Thanks
 Chandler:What check thing?
 Chandler:(reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete… (quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?
 Chandler:Who’s he huggin’?
 Chandler:This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
 Chandler:There you go!!
 Chandler:(to the girls who are staring at him) What?
 Chandler:(in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)
 Chandler:Okay okay just because he buys you dinner does not mean you owe him anything.
 Chandler:Okay then get the lobster!
 Chandler:Mr. Millionaire new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
 Chandler:Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
 Chandler:Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
 Chandler:Yeah either that or Gloria Estefan was right eventually the rhythm is going to get you.
 Chandler:It’s possible. You are very loveable I’d miss you if I broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.
 Chandler:(in a deep voice) If I broke up with you I’d miss you.
 Chandler:And you’re our age. You’re our age.
 Chandler:That’s not a state Joe.
 Chandler:You’re our age!
 Chandler:I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter I still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?
 Chandler:Is there any chance you didn’t see that?
 Chandler:Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!
 Chandler:You didn’t just break up.
 Chandler:You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
 Chandler:Stop what?!
 Chandler:No!! You can’t!!
 Chandler:I am your friend and I am not gonna let you do this!! (Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly strong!
 Chandler:Look man!
 Chandler:Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.)
 Chandler:She’s moving on! Okay if it’s not this guy it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay man? It’s over.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:I know. (He rubs Ross’s head)
 Chandler:I don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. (He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest like a gunfighter in a Western.)
 Chandler:(to Joey) I wasn’t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing his stuff down.) Uh-oh what did she do now?
 Chandler:Ah Sliced Bread a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
 Chandler:I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
 Chandler:I’m talking about you. You big big freak.
 Chandler:Hey you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
 Chandler:‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name.
 Chandler:No it’s not like like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider man. Y'know like ah like Goldman is a last name but there’s no Gold Man.
 Chandler:So ahh what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
 Chandler:What about things that are already gold?
 Chandler:Okay let’s play my game now.
 Chandler:Wait a minute wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!
 Chandler:My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh that’s-that’s okay no problem. (He starts to look around her office.)
 Chandler:Yes I realise that.
 Chandler:That’s the stuff! (quickly grabs it)
 Chandler:Thanks it’s ah Gaelic for ‘Thy turkey’s done.’ So ah I’m gonna go nice nice meeting you.
 Chandler:Hello.
 Chandler:(holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?
 Chandler:Oh I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
 Chandler:Oh-ho liked what she saw huh? Dug my action did she? Checkin’ out the Chan-Chan man!
 Chandler:Yeah she seemed cool attractive. I’ll do it.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey my Father’s house does that!
 Chandler:Well the movie was great dinner was great and there’s nothing like a cool crisp New York evening.
 Chandler:Of course I didn’t get to enjoy any of that because Joanna’s such a big dull dud!
 Chandler:(entering with Rachel) I’m telling ya Joanna’s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime. I’ll give you a call.’
 Chandler:That’s what you say at the end of a date.
 Chandler:To her face? Look it’s the end of the date I’m standing there I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know comes out. I can’t help it it’s a compulsion.
 Chandler:Multiple so many paper cuts.
 Chandler:(sarcastic) Oh well give me the phone then.
 Chandler:Look you can’t call somebody after this long just to say ‘In case you didn’t notice I don’t like you!’
 Chandler:Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
 Chandler:All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
 Chandler:That’s just a lot of big talk y'know.
 Chandler:It’s not a big deal. It’s just it’s right here (points to his eye) and it’s all the time.
 Chandler:(He looks over at Rachel who nods her head) Yes this this was pleasant.
 Chandler:The food there was was great.
 Chandler:So take care.
 Chandler:Well this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime. (Rachel is disappointed)
 Chandler:Noo!
 Chandler:Look I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak and pathetic and sorry.
 Chandler:Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you.
 Chandler:I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I was going to when I’m not. Look this has nothing to do with you y'know? And this isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment intimacy (pause) mascara goop. And I’m really sorry it’s just that this is not this isn’t going to work out.
 Chandler:Yeah o-okay.
 Chandler:Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
 Chandler:(sporting a goatee) Hey.
 Chandler:Oh so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me. (there’s no reaction from Joey) Okay listen you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:No way!
 Chandler:Oh my God! Who’s gonna watch that?!
 Chandler:Yeah. (they start to leave)
 Chandler:Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)
 Chandler:So um after you put the suggestion in the box how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
 Chandler:Okay so I guess that’s about ah two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Okay. (He opens it and it’s a baby chick) It’s a chicken.
 Chandler:Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
 Chandler:Easy Lenny.
 Chandler:Okay but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here and a chick-chick there. Here a chick there a chick everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey enters)-chickeeeen.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:She?
 Chandler:I don’t know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over trying to determine the sex of the chick and blows on it.) I can’t tell what ever it was went back in too quickly.
 Chandler:Excuse me?
 Chandler:I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
 Chandler:You don’t think I get up when you get up?
 Chandler:Yes here it comes! I’m stuck here all day and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don’t think so mister!
 Chandler:And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?
 Chandler:I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got this chick we’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?
 Chandler:I’ll take her back tomorrow.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:(rushing in) Oh good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
 Chandler:I know. See yes. That’s Yasmine Bleeth she’s a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter and you know what I found out?
 Chandler:If they can’t find a home for her they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
 Chandler:Okay. And it’s not just chicks y'know? It’s all kinds of other animals!
 Chandler:Thanks I’m glad you see it that way.
 Chandler:Ohhh-hoo funny story!
 Chandler:Okay! Now you stay out here and you think about what you did!!
 Chandler:That’s a bad duck!!! (to Ross) How’d the thing go tonight Ross?
 Chandler:(to the duck) Okay now when you come back I hope you remember that that chick is not a toy! (He goes back into the apartment)
 Chandler:(coming out of his apartment and seeing Ross) What did you do?
 Chandler:Having a swim.
 Chandler:Chicks don’t swim.
 Chandler:I don’t know. Should we try it?
 Chandler:See I told you they don’t swim. (He goes to take it out)
 Chandler:Noo! (takes him out) Oh it’s okay it’s okay baby baby baby.
 Chandler:Ye-e-es!!
 Chandler:Who’s number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
 Chandler:Bye!
 Chandler:Yeah and I don’t have any cologne.
 Chandler:Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
 Chandler:(entering carrying the chick and duck) Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
 Chandler:Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
 Chandler:(seeing Joey) There he is!
 Chandler:Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:So that’s the girl you like.
 Chandler:Wait a minute wait a minute you don’t like the guy Rachel’s dating? Well that’s odd.
 Chandler:Could I borrow it?
 Chandler:Oh-ho-ho-ho.
 Chandler:715. (Monica looks at him) Watch doesn’t work.
 Chandler:Yeah and at the end of the play he he got up y'know and he just started like (claps his hands) banging his hands together!
 Chandler:Ross don’t. Ross!
 Chandler:Ohh that’s a good one.
 Chandler:Why don’t you use ours across the hall ‘cause she…has…problems.
 Chandler:Step away from the duck.
 Chandler:And yet she’s still not hanging up the phone.
 Chandler:Ye-e-es!!
 Chandler:Who’s number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
 Chandler:Bye!
 Chandler:Yeah and I don’t have any cologne.
 Chandler:Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
 Chandler:(entering carrying the chick and duck) Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
 Chandler:Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.

 Chandler:Ohh that’s a good one.
 Chandler:Why don’t you use ours across the hall ‘cause she…has…problems.
 Chandler:Step away from the duck.
 Chandler:And yet she’s still not hanging up the phone.
 Chandler:Do you think that there’s a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah as you’re driving into town there’s-there’s like a sign and it says “You’re in Sample.” (He says it like urine sample.)
 Chandler:Yeah it’s two guys in a ring and the rules are “They’re are no rules.”
 Chandler:Yes but there’s two in martini soo everybody back to my office.
 Chandler:Oh it’s Bing sir. I’m sorry  I was just ah...
 Chandler:All right buddy way to go! (smacks him on the butt)
 Chandler:Thank you! Today my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
 Chandler:Well I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
 Chandler:Yeah I know for a really great stew you just y'know stick your head in between ‘em.
 Chandler:(to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?
 Chandler:(to his co-workers) What is with him?
 Chandler:Well that’s not true he-he smacked you once.
 Chandler:No sir.
 Chandler:(joining them) Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger?
 Chandler:Nine times! Okay I had to put on lotion! But it’s gonna be okay because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment and if all goes as planned my butt will be smack free.
 Chandler:Excuse me Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!
 Chandler:No I ah I didn’t do them.
 Chandler:No no I just ah didn’t do them. Instead I ah hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise verbal or otherwise.
 Chandler:Doug!!
 Chandler:I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
 Chandler:No no. It-it’s not about the swearing it’s more about ah the way that you ah occasionally concentrate your enthusiasm on my buttock.
 Chandler:Oh and don’t get me wrong I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I I have a rather sensitive posterior and ah besides it’s making all the other guys jealous.
 Chandler:Okay. (he starts to leave)
 Chandler:Ahhhhh! (walks out imitating shooting himself in the head)
 Chandler:Thank you sir.
 Chandler:No. No not at all that’s-that’s ridiculous.
 Chandler:Ye-ye-yeah yes I do!
 Chandler:Run! Run you crazy rich freak!
 Chandler:(to Bonnie) So ah your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
 Chandler:Tell it again. (pause we see Rachel is not amused.) Seriously.

 Chandler:You’re not gonna die an old maid maybe an old spinster cook.
 Chandler:Hey now besides if worst comes to worst I’ll be your boyfriend.
 Chandler:Why is that so funny?
 Chandler:Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah boyfriend material?
 Chandler:Okay so we’ve established my name and hit me. But theoretically y'know I mean say we weren’t friends say it’s a blind date. I show up at your door and I’m like (in a fake voice) “Hey nice to meet ya. Hey oh-hey.”
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:What a minute I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can’t have children!!
 Chandler:Buy it for ya or win it for ya?
 Chandler:Big bullies!!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Bored and bored!
 Chandler:Yes!
 Chandler:Okay umm we all have to play strip poker.
 Chandler:So you still don’t think I’m boyfriend material?
 Chandler:I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
 Chandler:Yeah well lucky for you.
 Chandler:I don’t know.
 Chandler:Oh yeah I don’t know what they were doing but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
 Chandler:Where ya going?
 Chandler:(to Joey) Noo!! I don’t care! I’m not I’m not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
 Chandler:Okay then you gotta back away all right? You don’t need that kind’ve hurt. Take it from a guy who’s never had a long term relationship......

 Chandler:Okay! Okay! Let me try it again you’re gonna wanna date this next guy I swear!
 Chandler:Hi! I’m Dorf! You’re date for the evening. (Monica walks away in disgust) Oh come on! Dorf on dating that’s good stuff!!
 Chandler:(to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away in disgust)
 Chandler:(jumping up) Oh I’ll go out and get you some.
 Chandler:Nope! Because I’m not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe who’s entering) Hey Pheebs how did it go?
 Chandler:I found a dried up seashores.
 Chandler:All right there’s a nuclear holocaust I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
 Chandler:I’ve got canned goods.
 Chandler:Excellent hole Joe.
 Chandler:Well can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
 Chandler:We’ve got to do something!
 Chandler:Y'know what he’s right. There’s something like uh ammonia in that that like kills the pain.
 Chandler:Me too!!
 Chandler:Oh my God! If you say that one more time I’m gonna break up with you!
 Chandler:Look Ross you have what you want you’re back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
 Chandler:(jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
 Chandler:I’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
 Chandler:(running over and joining Monica) They’ll never understand!
 Chandler:(following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn’t think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monica’s shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)
 Chandler:And then Joey remembered something.
 Chandler:(wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me “Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!” Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
 Chandler:(entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?
 Chandler:I KNEW IT!!!!
 Chandler:We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple we could play this game naked.
 Chandler:Okay. All right.
 Chandler:Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
 Chandler:You don’t turn and slide you throw it out! I’m tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
 Chandler:All right how about we how ‘bout we sell it.
 Chandler:(nods his head) Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to Joey) They seem all right with it!
 Chandler:Uh-huh first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
 Chandler:(reading the ad) Stunning entertainment center. Fine (pause) fine Italian craftsmanship. (Joey is very proud of himself)
 Chandler:You want it?
 Chandler:Ahh Gepeto $5000 dollars? Are you insane?
 Chandler:All right look I’m changing it to 50 bucks or your best offer.
 Chandler:(looks at him) Nooo.
 Chandler:I can’t believe you don’t know what I do for a living!
 Chandler:(interrupting) Let it go!!
 Chandler:Yes Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
 Chandler:You’ll have to pardon my roommate he wanted to marry this.
 Chandler:Y'know I I really don’t think we need a canoe.
 Chandler:All right just just take the entertainment center and then when you get home throw the canoe away!
 Chandler:Y'know what I think this might be one of the times he’s wrong.
 Chandler:Oh-no he’s right.
 Chandler:I’m coming already!!
 Chandler:OH MY GOD!!!
 Chandler:Are you all right?!
 Chandler:(lets him out) What happened?!!
 Chandler:What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
 Chandler:So—You got in voluntarily?!
 Chandler:BEND OVER?!!!
 Chandler:Oh umm Joey was born and then 28 years later I was robbed!!
 Chandler:Oh they said uh “You don’t have insurance here so stop calling us.”
 Chandler:Pheebs if she could come back as a couch we’d really appreciate it. (Joey nods in agreement)
 Chandler:Yeah it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn’t say ‘cool’ anymore.
 Chandler:Oh yeah gym member. I try to go four times a week but I’ve missed the last 1200 times.
 Chandler:You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
 Chandler:Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:Oh no you’ll have to come.
 Chandler:Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?
 Chandler:Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on the table!
 Chandler:Yes. (In a stronger voice) Yes!
 Chandler:No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
 Chandler:Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.
 Chandler:I wanna quit the gym.
 Chandler:(He turns to Ross and Ross makes a ‘Be strong’ sound.) I wanna quit the gym.
 Chandler:(horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about himself) I wanna quit the gym.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:No I almost did couldn’t leave Ross there without a spotter!
 Chandler:We’re doomed. Okay they’re gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
 Chandler:You’re a genius!
 Chandler:Now there’s two reasons.
 Chandler:Thank you Joey.

 Chandler:There we go little fella.
 Chandler:Well the duck can swim.
 Chandler:Oh yeah me too she's so cool and pretty.
 Chandler:She's smart and funny y'know? We were up all last night talking she said the funniest thing about--what?
 Chandler:No I don't.
 Chandler:Thank you Ross.
 Chandler:All right.
 Chandler:All right.
 Chandler:Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keeps running Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to The Mod Squad starts to play. First a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a hot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs in desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees himself and resumes the chase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of garbage he tries to get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. He gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of cabs.) Kathy! (He jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) Kathy.
 Chandler:Oh I just wanted to say Hey!
 Chandler:Okay. (He walks away disgusted with himself.)
 Chandler:(entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
 Chandler:I don't know. I can't--I just I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean I'm a very bad person. I'm a very very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he waits for a reaction when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
 Chandler:Really?!
 Chandler:(laughs) Right in there!
 Chandler:99...100! Ready or not here I come! (He opens his eyes and sees that the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All right let's go over the concept one more time.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Ohh umm y'know what I already ate.
 Chandler:Y'know I had a big meal on Monday y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
 Chandler:You-you do?
 Chandler:You got me.
 Chandler:Yeah. Right.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Ohh she's-she's not really my type.
 Chandler:Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
 Chandler:Uhh no-no thanks.
 Chandler:Listen I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Hey look what do you want from me?
 Chandler:I am pretending.
 Chandler:Okay what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? (Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically over-the-top wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
 Chandler:Can I sleep on your couch?
 Chandler:Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
 Chandler:Where did you when did you how did you... (Joey hits the back of Chandler's head) How did you get a girl like that?
 Chandler:Okay but that's like the easiest era.
 Chandler:Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
 Chandler:Phebes it was your birthday like months ago.
 Chandler:Well I have a call in about that.
 Chandler:Actually this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
 Chandler:Okay but don't touch it because you fingers have destructive oils.
 Chandler:Oh it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
 Chandler:It doesn't say that. Does it?
 Chandler:Okay all right I'll just uh make sure that uh Joey gets her something really great.
 Chandler:It's okay the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into the bathroom.) Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
 Chandler:(confused) Sure...
 Chandler:I don't know... um Grease?
 Chandler:Rent?
 Chandler:Okay so when do you want to go?
 Chandler:Yes it is at Office Max.
 Chandler:A pen.
 Chandler:Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
 Chandler:Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
 Chandler:All right look look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
 Chandler:For three years?
 Chandler:All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her okay?
 Chandler:Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
 Chandler:Okay all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
 Chandler:Oh yeah. Yeah I found this great place called Invisible things for Kathy. (Motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
 Chandler:She's really going to love this you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
 Chandler:Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
 Chandler:Where?
 Chandler:I got something for her. (Joey picks up the package shakes it next to his ear can't hear anything switches ears shakes it again.) It's a book!
 Chandler:No it's a book that's just a book okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So uh just... let me know if she likes it okay?
 Chandler:No it came out to an even twenty.
 Chandler:Hey how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
 Chandler:Oh yeah? That's great!
 Chandler:[nodding with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh....
 Chandler:Hey! Happy birthday.
 Chandler:No he didn't. [Moving it back.]
 Chandler:Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
 Chandler:See you think it's just a pen but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
 Chandler:Oh yeah... yeah.
 Chandler:[to Kathy] Goodnight.
 Chandler:Oh uh yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing you... you don't always know the exact time.
 Chandler:Uh the book?
 Chandler:What do you mean?
 Chandler:(tongue-tied) Uhl..ell. By the way in case you missed that that sound was Uhl ell.
 Chandler:Oh yeah he's my... he's my best friend.
 Chandler:Goodnight. (Goes to his room.)
 Chandler:(entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
 Chandler:It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way I think she knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles she’s smooth! Smooth! (leaves)
 Chandler:(rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
 Chandler:Goin’ out huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So things didn’t work out with Kathy huh? Bummer.
 Chandler:(shocked) What?
 Chandler:Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!
 Chandler:Well I’m upset—for you. I mean having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can’t believe he just sad that.)
 Chandler:Look Joey Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey I mean granted I only saw the back of her head but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart and funny and gets you.
 Chandler:All right look I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice pick a lane.
 Chandler:All right! Bring it on you…
 Chandler:(interrupting) Oh my God! Play!
 Chandler:Really bitchin’!
 Chandler:You mean like music?
 Chandler:Yeah I know what you’re thinkin’! Yes yes your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
 Chandler:Come in!
 Chandler:Uh yes but uh I just watch it for the articles.
 Chandler:No-no he’s not back yet but he’ll be here any minute. So uh come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
 Chandler:I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) …of the boat. (The phone rings and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.
 Chandler:What happened?
 Chandler:Why can’t you tell her?
 Chandler:Joey! Joey!!
 Chandler:I thought your time ran out.
 Chandler:(to Kathy) Uhh that was Joey. He’s running a little late he says he’s sorry.
 Chandler:So I guess it’s just uh you and me then.
 Chandler:Yeah I think it is!
 Chandler:Oh I had an appointment to get my haircut…
 Chandler:…and then it got canceled.
 Chandler:Really?! You do that?
 Chandler:Dog grooming huh? Okay just don’t make my tail too poofy.
 Chandler:Well thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through his hair and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Y’know who also has great hair is Joey!
 Chandler:What-what ‘cha doin’?
 Chandler:‘Kay.
 Chandler:(jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phone’s making sounds! (On phone) Hello!
 Chandler:Hey it’s Joey!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)
 Chandler:Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
 Chandler:Oh.
 Chandler:No-no-no-no this is bad! It’s bad! This is bad!
 Chandler:Wait the uh the kiss or the situation?
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here’s what we do we-we forget it happened.
 Chandler:Okay we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we’re unhappy forever. Sound good?
 Chandler:I have to; he’s my best friend and you’re seeing him.
 Chandler:(interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Don’t! Don’t! See-see you’re getting me confused I’m starting to urn.
 Chandler:I-I think we have too.
 Chandler:Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against the door.) Are you still out there?
 Chandler:Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to reveal a fully furnished apartment.)
 Chandler:I sure did.
 Chandler:Well I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the TV.)
 Chandler:Well y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
 Chandler:Oh I don’t know.
 Chandler:You mean with Casey.
 Chandler:Or Casey.
 Chandler:Could be Casey.
 Chandler:Consider Casey.
 Chandler:That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
 Chandler:I kissed Kathy.
 Chandler:No. Is there anyway anyway you think he’ll understand this?
 Chandler:Oh don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Is it?
 Chandler:Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!
 Chandler:God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!
 Chandler:Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
 Chandler:Yeah I know.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Is that a real thing?
 Chandler:Listen ah Joe I-I need to I need to talk to you about something.
 Chandler:It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm uh I like her. I like her a lot actually.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Oh uh when?
 Chandler:Oh man I am so sorry. Are are you okay?
 Chandler:Yes but I-I uh don’t have too.
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:Well I thought that would be the best thing to do.
 Chandler:See uh that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
 Chandler:It’s me. I’m the other guy.
 Chandler:Yeah I mean when you were late last night Kathy and I got to talking and one thing to another and…
 Chandler:No! No! No! I just kissed her.
 Chandler:How is that worse?!
 Chandler:Look I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do I think I’m in love with her!
 Chandler:You’re right I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
 Chandler:Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
 Chandler:Probably because…
 Chandler:(on phone) Hey it’s me. I know you can’t stand to be in the same room as me so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone. All I… (Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)
 Chandler:Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend but I’m… (Joey hangs up the phone again.)
 Chandler:(entering) Aww turkey! Aww giving thanks! Aww!
 Chandler:They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night just trying to get him to talk to me.
 Chandler:Hey by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa ‘cause I wanna trade for her.
 Chandler:Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
 Chandler:Oh that’s not true! That’s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it… (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe’s faces.) Oh there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase and I had R.G. put on it… (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials…
 Chandler:Op y'know what though it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase.
 Chandler:Hey what time is it? The big game is about to start!
 Chandler:Thanks.
 Chandler:Monica got ice in her eye and it hurts.
 Chandler:Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
 Chandler:He’s really picky about his patients.
 Chandler:(entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah he gave me the finger while doing it.
 Chandler:Oh y’know what I was already trying to trade for ah well you.
 Chandler:I don’t know R.G. I was thinking something girlie for your office.
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no you don’t want to do that then you’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
 Chandler:Like?
 Chandler:When was the last time you saw her wear it?
 Chandler:Big dog?
 Chandler:I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
 Chandler:Hey Joe.
 Chandler:Hey! I’m sorry! That—(sees that Joey is about to leave) where are you going?
 Chandler:Oh uh when-when are you coming back?
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:Hey look what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her?
 Chandler:Hey look I know what it is to be a friend I just-I just screwed up!
 Chandler:All right look if you’re not gonna stay for me then at least stay for them! Okay they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:All right wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?
 Chandler:(He is now in the box in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
 Chandler:The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through the air hole) it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another finger) it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a third finger) it hurts!
 Chandler:Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)
 Chandler:How do ya do.
 Chandler:What happened? What happened?!
 Chandler:Gotcha! (laughs)
 Chandler:Sorry!
 Chandler:Okay okay you got it!
 Chandler:You can’t tell but I’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
 Chandler:You’re right and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear I won’t say another word tonight.
 Chandler:Absolutely!
 Chandler:So?
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:Man this is…
 Chandler:Oh yeah! How did you meet her?
 Chandler:Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
 Chandler:How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie? (laughs at they all look at him) That joke would’ve killed in Albany.
 Chandler:Hey look at this! (Holding a newspaper) They’re lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
 Chandler:All right who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this I can’t believe I missed it.
 Chandler:Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.
 Chandler:Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office do you want me to set you up?
 Chandler:Well I have a girlfriend I’m-I’m happy. So I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
 Chandler:Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
 Chandler:Hey you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director I think it was Orson Wells who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know who’s boss.
 Chandler:(he glares at him for a while) Yes.
 Chandler:I say Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him) Og-ee-op I’m not asking for me I’m… I mean… No I’m-I’m not gay I’m not asking you out. I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!
 Chandler:See my friend-my friend Rachel she wants to be set up.
 Chandler:Oh y’know what that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling that might be all right with Rachel.
 Chandler:(to Drew) Oh by the way that is her full name.
 Chandler:Oh well that’s uh a little later than I uh generally care to stay but sure!
 Chandler:Well I don’t really know what that is but let’s!!
 Chandler:(entering) Hello children!
 Chandler:(to Rachel) Have I got the 50 guys for you!
 Chandler:Oh yeah I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They’re buying me drinks! They’re giving me stuff! (to Joey) Knicks tonight?
 Chandler:Wherever! I’ve got like 20!
 Chandler:Y’know what I’m gonna uh play the field just a little more.
 Chandler:Guys are signing over their 401-K’s to me?
 Chandler:(pause) Yes. (to Rachel) Okay there’s this one guy Patrick I think you’re gonna like him he’s really nice he’s funny he’s a swimmer.
 Chandler:Yes and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
 Chandler:See I’m not bad at this fixing up thing huh?
 Chandler:Oh he works in the Fine Foods division.
 Chandler:It’s a big company I don’t—if you—I…
 Chandler:Oh yeah! With who?
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Hey man!
 Chandler:Well like father like son.
 Chandler:Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
 Chandler:Ummmmmmmm no.
 Chandler:Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see.
 Chandler:(interrupting) Oh y’know y’know what Pheebs?
 Chandler:I’m not Jewish so…
 Chandler:Bad dream?
 Chandler:Oh yeah then uh what was Phoebe’s song about?
 Chandler:Prague?
 Chandler:I did! I absolutely did!
 Chandler:I’m sure you’re right but why?
 Chandler:Oh man. I’m sorry I’m so-so sorry.
 Chandler:I know! I know!
 Chandler:Well y’know you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody! You’re a great catch! Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you I didn’t have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)
 Chandler:Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude right?
 Chandler:Oh it doesn’t matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey y’know what I’ve got two tickets to tonight’s Rangers game you wanna come with me?
 Chandler:Well actually it’s a hockey team so it’s angry Canadians with no teeth.
 Chandler:Have you ever been with a woman?
 Chandler:So there is no good time to ask that question.
 Chandler:Oh yeah! How did you meet her?
 Chandler:Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
 Chandler:How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie? (laughs at they all look at him) That joke would’ve killed in Albany.

 Chandler:Have you ever been with a woman?
 Chandler:So there is no good time to ask that question.
 Chandler:I don’t know but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
 Chandler:Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
 Chandler:Well you-you know what I meant.
 Chandler:So what job did you get Joe?
 Chandler:You’re gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
 Chandler:Oh yeah sure it’s not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
 Chandler:Yes. Right where?
 Chandler:Yeah you-you gotta love the talking.
 Chandler:All right we haven’t had sex yet. Okay what’s the big deal? Y’know? This is special and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
 Chandler:No he’s right I’m totally lying.
 Chandler:Well Kathy’s last boyfriend was Joey.
 Chandler:No I’m afraid I won’t be able to make love as well as him.
 Chandler:Yes and I was saying the actual words.
 Chandler:We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:All right all right I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I’m just doing it for you guys.
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
 Chandler:Yes yes we had the sex.
 Chandler:It was fine y’know? But she didn’t agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like I see you point I’m all right with it.
 Chandler:Look you have to help me! Okay? I mean I know what to do with a woman y’know I know where everything goes it’s always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to My God! Somebody’s killing her in there!
 Chandler:Look you don’t have to draw an actual wo—whoa! She’s hot!
 Chandler:(shocked) There are seven?!
 Chandler:(Points to one) That’s one?
 Chandler:Oh y’know-y’know what I was looking at it upside down.
 Chandler:That-that’s bad?
 Chandler:Well you might if it were anything like 7!
 Chandler:You!
 Chandler:Well the vet seems to think that’s she’s becoming a rooster. (The rooster crows.) We’re getting a second opinion.
 Chandler:Oh I can uh check that for ya.
 Chandler:I can check that for ya.
 Chandler:Well… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
 Chandler:(to Rachel) And you… Ross I believe if you check Rachel’s bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
 Chandler:Okay ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Stop that now!
 Chandler:Yes!
 Chandler:Diet soda.
 Chandler:Orange juice.
 Chandler:Oh-oh oh oh-oh! (Whispers something in Joey’s ear.)
 Chandler:I got it! Scotch… tape. (They’re right.)
 Chandler:Well we used there’s up last night making scary faces.
 Chandler:All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
 Chandler:Fears and Pet Peeves.
 Chandler:His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
 Chandler:She has a real name.
 Chandler:Althea?! What are you doing?!
 Chandler:You're shooting with Althea?!
 Chandler:Nice shooting!
 Chandler:Actually it’s Miss Chinandolor Bong.
 Chandler:Unfortunately that is correct.
 Chandler:I majored in lightning rounds. All right we’re gonna destroy you.
 Chandler:Well I’m so confused as to what we’ve been doing so far…
 Chandler:Say 200?
 Chandler:(interrupting) All right hold on! If you win we give up the birds.
 Chandler:But if we win we get your apartment.
 Chandler:Okay. (Starts jumping around.)
 Chandler:Dangerous Liaisons.
 Chandler:Oh! (Whispers something in Joey’s ear and then in Ross’s ear.)
 Chandler:Fancy.
 Chandler:Fancy guest.
 Chandler:Thanks man.
 Chandler:You can’t just call Monica’s room.
 Chandler:Oh I would never bet this apartment. It’s too nice.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Yeah but I bet it works.
 Chandler:Well believe it baby!
 Chandler:I knew it!
 Chandler:Cool girl roommate.
 Chandler:Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
 Chandler:What?! What-what is it?!
 Chandler:I can’t believe we live here!
 Chandler:Okay she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
 Chandler:I know!!
 Chandler:Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?
 Chandler:Is it just me or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
 Chandler:Yeah it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
 Chandler:I’m totally screwed. Okay they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like So where’s your boyfriend what’s-his-name Chester? And she’ll go No-no-no it’s Chandler. And he’ll go Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
 Chandler:All right look look what am I gonna do?
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:So uh man are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
 Chandler:Yeah I know but…
 Chandler:Okay okay but don’t worry because we also have cereals muffins waffles and jams jellies and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.
 Chandler:I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means Joey told us what this means!
 Chandler:Come on it was like cousins having sex up there!
 Chandler:Oh I loved the play. You were great and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having sex with him.
 Chandler:Oh come on it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
 Chandler:Y’know I-I could see how this could happen y'know you’re up there every night you’re naked touching kissing.
 Chandler:Well you can understand given how we started.
 Chandler:Well that is what happened and I don’t even see you denying this!
 Chandler:Yeah well don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!
 Chandler:Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at the new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behind their backs. Chandler wonders into the girl’s apartment.) You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
 Chandler:I confronted her and she didn’t deny it! (Pause) I don’t live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)
 Chandler:Well I may be drunk but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie’s…
 Chandler:Yes! See you and I have always been like—(motions that they think the same.)
 Chandler:Did she call?
 Chandler:All right maybe I should call her.
 Chandler:Well yeah but y'know what-what if I was wrong?
 Chandler:Well y'know what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?
 Chandler:She did not have to tell me I saw the play and there was no heat. Back me up here Ross!
 Chandler:That’s not backing me up! Look you said with the off-stage and the heat and the onstage and the oy heat.
 Chandler:Oh my God!!
 Chandler:Hey. I just I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry. Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
 Chandler:Yeah I know I-I wish I had too but y’know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight and now we can move on. Y’know I know for me—(Notices a pair of men’s pants on the chair.) Nick’s pants?
 Chandler:Yeah. Well I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
 Chandler:Well she wasn’t sleeping with him.
 Chandler:She is now.
 Chandler:I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick with his rock hard pecs and his giant man-nipples! I hate him I hate her! Well I don’t hate her I love her. This is all my fault really.
 Chandler:Because I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called her after our big stupid fight she never would’ve gone out with Nick and they would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
 Chandler:You don’t have to stop having fun just because I’m here. Kathy didn’t cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well except you. (They hug and Chandler goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)
 Chandler:(opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would you give me one minute!! Please.
 Chandler:Y’know I can’t believe Kathy did this too me. I really thought that she was the one. I tell you what from now on I’m never getting out of this chair ever! Okay? From now on this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
 Chandler:That’s right! Where are the guys? I’m ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
 Chandler:They got a breakfast buffet.
 Chandler:Ooh let me talk to him!
 Chandler:Well can I just…
 Chandler:She’s shhing me! It’s my phone and she’s shhing me!
 Chandler:Ow!
 Chandler:Maybe she doesn’t hit him all the time.
 Chandler:Okay I’m going to go stand over there. (Points and moves into the living room.)
 Chandler:So y’know uh when’s he getting back?
 Chandler:Y’know I knew something like this was going to happen. (He starts to take off his pants revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)
 Chandler:Yes you can. You’re thinking about time you can’t go back in time.
 Chandler:(laughs) No you can’t.
 Chandler:You don’t want to be guys you’d be all hairy and wouldn’t live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)
 Chandler:Okay. (Starts to cry)
 Chandler:No thanks Mom!
 Chandler:Ahh come on! Y’know what—y’know what I think I’m just gonna go home and call Kathy.
 Chandler:No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I’m gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that I’m gonna get so drunk I’m gonna wanna call Janice
 Chandler:Ohhh!!
 Chandler:Oh yeah that was great. Thanks to you the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
 Chandler:All right well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:Stripping!
 Chandler:Okay look I’m gonna have to ask you all to leave.
 Chandler:Look forget it. We tried but Phase Three is a lost cause Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot and I couldn’t picture myself with any of them. (Sits back in disgust.)
 Chandler:(jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
 Chandler:I am totally picturing you with all those women!
 Chandler:Well I’m there too!
 Chandler:Stop it! You’re killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
 Chandler:Where I don’t want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
 Chandler:Come on let me see that smile.
 Chandler:Please?
 Chandler:I know I know but you’re gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
 Chandler:All right ladies here’s what we’re gonna do. (Points to a stripper.) You are gonna take off my clothes. (To another two strippers) You two go get the oils. (To another stripper) And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice Chandler’s the king! Chandler’s the king!
 Chandler:Oh that’s fine! Go with your instincts go with your instincts.
 Chandler:Come on! Would you please pay attention I could wake up at any moment!
 Chandler:What do you want from me I’ve never met the guy. So anyway Rachel I’m sorry you can’t stay (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (The cigarette guy starts rubbing Chandler’s back.) What are you doing? (The guy just nods) All right listen I’ve got to wake up!
 Chandler:Y'know I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And you said it was gonna be fun! (pause) Which it kinda is.  Also you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
 Chandler:That’s a mailman! That’s our mailman! (Waves to the mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?
 Chandler:Hey you know who used to have nails like that?
 Chandler:(entering with Janice in tow) Hello!
 Chandler:Isn’t this amazing?
 Chandler:Okay. Bye.
 Chandler:Bye.
 Chandler:Bye.
 Chandler:B-bye!
 Chandler:Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After it’s closed) I can’t stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked Joey is relieved.)
 Chandler:Yeah I know but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice her laugh her personality—Well they’re all back! Y’know? And she’s picked up like nine new ones!
 Chandler:Don’t worry about it. I’m taking care of it tonight. (Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)
 Chandler:(standing in the door of the fridge) Well I don’t have to break up with her this time. We’re not involved! I’m going to do a pre-emptive strike! I’m going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the fridge.)
 Chandler:Yes I-I know that you do but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
 Chandler:(laughs) Okay we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship…
 Chandler:Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
 Chandler:I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately my company is transferring me overseas!
 Chandler:No! No! Not Paris.
 Chandler:Okay could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen. That’s right yes I’m being transferred to Yemen!
 Chandler:I don’t know exactly.
 Chandler:But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow.
 Chandler:Y’know uh you didn’t really have to help me pack.
 Chandler:Well I-I thought I did but I-I guess I did not!
 Chandler:Oh I’m packing. Y’know I’m-I’m packing ‘cause I’m moving to Yemen tomorrow.
 Chandler:I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen it’s the only way I can get rid off her.
 Chandler:(to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey trade lives with me!
 Chandler:(from his bedroom) Thanks!
 Chandler:Y’know you really didn’t have to take me to the airport.
 Chandler:Well we’re really not that close. (Pause) Okay so I guess this is uh good-bye then.
 Chandler:Okay. Then I guess it’s just wait here then. (Hands her the sign that says Wait Here.) (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no no. No no no I just I just need a pretend ticket.
 Chandler:What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
 Chandler:No. All right y’know what she’s (Points to Janice) gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card.
 Chandler:(to the ticket agent) American Express?
 Chandler:Well I-I guess I gotta go.
 Chandler:Well just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
 Chandler:Okay good-bye. Good-bye.
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
 Chandler:Well I then guess I’m going to Yemen! I’m going to Yemen! (To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen can I stay with you?
 Chandler:Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
 Chandler:What are you writing?
 Chandler:Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua give me a call sometime guys like you (Pause) never go out of style—what did you throw away?
 Chandler:Hi guys!
 Chandler:Without me?!
 Chandler:Yes but in Ross’s case they both know in two weeks that’s it.
 Chandler:Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!
 Chandler:What are you talking about?
 Chandler:Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to the living room.)
 Chandler:Like what?
 Chandler:I said Like what?
 Chandler:Does for me.
 Chandler:Flashdance.
 Chandler:She was a welder.
 Chandler:What are the odds? What are the odds?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away giving the sandwich to Phoebe.)
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh-ho yeah!
 Chandler:Treeger’s snaking the shower drain.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Do we pay for this?
 Chandler:Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill—free phone sex.
 Chandler:Yeah Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just came on!
 Chandler:Like finding money with naked people on it!
 Chandler:We don’t know what could make this go away.
 Chandler:And no one touches the air around the TV!
 Chandler:We still have porn.
 Chandler:Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.
 Chandler:It’s the theme from Good Will Humping.
 Chandler:Oh-oh yeah and did he also say that ah some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
 Chandler:They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
 Chandler:Whoa-whoa wait a minute did you say you love her?
 Chandler:All right look forget it forget it. You told her you love her it’s over.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Okay. (Pause) Good one.
 Chandler:Hi! Listen can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In Again.
 Chandler:Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
 Chandler:Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
 Chandler:What’s the second part of your plan?
 Chandler:You put your fist through the wall?
 Chandler:A place where no one will ever get out alive?
 Chandler:Are we in London?
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:I was just at the bank and there was this really hot teller and she didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
 Chandler:What no Nice apartment I bet the bedrooms are huge?
 Chandler:Y’know what we have to turn off the porn.
 Chandler:All right ready?
 Chandler:Two.
 Chandler:Yeah that’s kinda a relief.
 Chandler:You wanna see if we still have it?
 Chandler:FREE PORN!!!
 Chandler:We have free porn here!!!
 Chandler:Hey! Wow it is true what they say pregnant bellies look like a drum.
 Chandler:All right.
 Chandler:Wouldn’t that be Frank the III?
 Chandler:Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
 Chandler:Well it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
 Chandler:Hey y’know what if you’re gonna do that if you’re gonna name him Joey you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesn’t think so.) Oh come on! Chandler’s funny sophisticated and he’s very loveable once you get to know him.
 Chandler:Well Chandler will be there for you too. I mean well he might be a little late but-but he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda if want you need him for is that you’re really hot.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:And now you’re giving me the message!
 Chandler:You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
 Chandler:Hi! Hi! You’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
 Chandler:Raymond Chandler.
 Chandler:Okay there are no famous Joey’s. Except for huh Joey Buttafucco.
 Chandler:Okay look Joey! Come on think about it first of all he’ll never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey.
 Chandler:Wow you’re you’re right. I have a horrible horrible name.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:No no you’re right it is a ridiculous name!
 Chandler:Yes it is! From now on I have no first name.
 Chandler:I have no name.
 Chandler:Okay uh for now temporarily you can call me Clint.
 Chandler:Okay so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
 Chandler:It’s Clint. It’s Clint! (He heads for his bedroom.)
 Chandler:It’s Clint! Clint!
 Chandler:(entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark or a John?
 Chandler:All right look am I serious okay? Tomorrow at 330 I am going down to the courthouse.
 Chandler:Hey look this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay it’s probably why kids picked on me in school and why I never do well with women… So as of 4 o’clock tomorrow I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
 Chandler:(pleased) Really?!
 Chandler:Okay. Thanks.
 Chandler:You wanna hug it out?
 Chandler:Yay!
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Bye Pheebs!

 Chandler:Yeah we do!
 Chandler:Are you serious?
 Chandler:Forget it! Okay I’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
 Chandler:No. But uh Joey has and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
 Chandler:(ignoring him) Yes Gunther can I get two cups of chino please?
 Chandler:Forget it! Okay I’m not giving up the apartment.
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:You do know that Wham broke up?
 Chandler:Where is Emily?
 Chandler:Man didn’t she like just get here?
 Chandler:Easy tiger.
 Chandler:So what are you going to do?
 Chandler:Are you serious?
 Chandler:Because you’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay I’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with!
 Chandler:And I love the milk! But I’m not gonna some British girl to move in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey you say things now.
 Chandler:Okay no problem just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
 Chandler:No thank you.
 Chandler:Look I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay but we can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here! Didn’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
 Chandler:Look the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
 Chandler:Screw the Knicks!
 Chandler:I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
 Chandler:And the Knicks rule all.
 Chandler:No. No. We’re not gonna do that y’know why? Because its not an even trade.
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:Op op I’m convinced!
 Chandler:All right but you can’t use that again for a whole year. I’m in.
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Fine let’s do it.
 Chandler:Okay you guys uh you guys pick first
 Chandler:That’s a low one!
 Chandler:Why are you screaming and hugging?
 Chandler:Yeah baby!
 Chandler:Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) That’s courtside baby!
 Chandler:No they didn’t!
 Chandler:Those were like the best seats ever.
 Chandler:Oh yeah that’s very nice. Plus y’know they were free and they’re too small.
 Chandler:Oh. Oh God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head cut off.)
 Chandler:I KNOW!!!
 Chandler:Open up! Open up! Open up!
 Chandler:What the hell is going on?!
 Chandler:We are switching back right now!
 Chandler:Well you’re gonna have to leave sometime because you both have jobs and as soon as you do we’re switching it back! There’s nothing you can do to stop us! Right Joe?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:I don’t care this is our apartment! And they stole—you stole it—our apartment and we won that apartment fair and square twice! And I am getting it back right now. I’m getting back right now!
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no no more offers. You can’t offer anything to us!
 Chandler:Totally worth it!
 Chandler:Good night.
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Oh well that’s great!
 Chandler:Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
 Chandler:Oh. Oh did-did-did I wake you?
 Chandler:Gunther can I get another cup of coffee please? (Gunther starts to pour him another cup.) So uh what do you do when you’re not working here?
 Chandler:Oh okay thanks. (He goes back to the couch and rejoins Monica Joey and Phoebe.)
 Chandler:Well I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I’m exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
 Chandler:It’s not something to be proud of okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
 Chandler:They don’t have those.
 Chandler:Next time you snore I’m rolling ya over!
 Chandler:Hey all right!
 Chandler:Oh she’s got you running errands y’know picking up wedding dresses… (Laughs and makes like Indiana Jones and his whip) Wah-pah!
 Chandler:Y’know whipped! Wah-pah!
 Chandler:That’s what I did. Wah-pah!
 Chandler:All right buddy time to roll over. (Rolls him over and discovers a surprise) (Looking down) No-no! (Covers his eyes) No no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You’re going to a clinic and a pyjama store!
 Chandler:It’s 600.
 Chandler:Hey I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily and I think that’s I think that’s really cool.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Yeah well I don’t dance at weddings.
 Chandler:Because weddings are a great place to meet women and when I dance I look like this… (Starts to dancing really really really badly. Ross enters behind him and he stops.)
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Nothing.
 Chandler:(answering for him) Yes he did.
 Chandler:(waking Joey) Hey check out that girl! She is really hot!
 Chandler:You’re coming on to the entire room! (He goes over to pick up a stack of magazines next to her and to get her attention he throws them back down.) I’m Chandler.
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:You mind if I…
 Chandler:So uh what are you in for?
 Chandler:What a coincidence I listen in my sleep.
 Chandler:(entering) Hello! Little ones.
 Chandler:Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (They’re stunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out but uh she picked me.
 Chandler:Because I’m cooler.
 Chandler:Well she’s she’s the kinda girl—Joey was unconscious.
 Chandler:Plus you look cool.
 Chandler:Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
 Chandler:Phoebe is making people.
 Chandler:And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here would be by the ass print on this chair! Look we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
 Chandler:No-no not something stupid something huge.
 Chandler:Why not?! I mean it’s just it’s just climbing! It’s just it’s just steep!
 Chandler:We’re going to Everest! Okay it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
 Chandler:Yeah baby!
 Chandler:(dejected) Yeah well…
 Chandler:Yeah we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!
 Chandler:(dejected) Oh well…
 Chandler:Yeeeeahhhh.
 Chandler:But I’ll tell you something. One of these days we’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
 Chandler:And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
 Chandler:Uh-oh.
 Chandler:She was not good. Not good.
 Chandler:Uh-oh.
 Chandler:(entering) Hello!
 Chandler:(sarcastic) Noo.
 Chandler:I didn’t know that.
 Chandler:See maybe that’s the one we should’ve actually hidden.
 Chandler:This isn’t one of those uh y’know If she doesn’t come we-we don’t we don’t come? Right? Because I already bought my ticket…
 Chandler:Oh that's Ross's.
 Chandler:Come on Ross? Remember back in college when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
 Chandler:(stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
 Chandler:I KNEW IT!!!!
 Chandler:Ahh so how many cameras are actually on you?
 Chandler:All right check it out. Check this out. It says here that there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the book.) It’s almost as good as being there.
 Chandler:Well You could but... probably just the one time.
 Chandler:If we do that we gotta get Die Hard.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:(shocked) Yes! Yes! A thousand times yes!
 Chandler:Oh it’s awkward. It’s awkward. It’s awkward.
 Chandler:You can be the best man when I get married.
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no you—yeah of course you get to be my best man.
 Chandler:I’m not even getting married! Okay this is a question for science fiction writers!
 Chandler:I’m not even… I’m not even…
 Chandler:(entering) Hey guys what are you doing?
 Chandler:Yeah well good luck trying to top the last one.
 Chandler:Oh I’m Ross. I’m Ross. I’m too good for the Hut; I’m too good for the Hut.
 Chandler:See ya. (Ross exits and Chandler moves over next to Joey laughing.) Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
 Chandler:He just said No strippers.
 Chandler:(banging a spoon against his beer bottle) Okay a little announcement a little announcement. I’ve decided that my best man is my best friend Gunther!
 Chandler:Central Perk?
 Chandler:(banging on the bottle again) Okay okay a little announcement I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh (to the stripper) so is the position of the bride.
 Chandler:(opening the door) What?
 Chandler:Ugh. Just a sec give me a minute to wake up for this—Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You’re the worst best man ever!
 Chandler:You slept with the stripper?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:So you might say the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little squeeze.)
 Chandler:So you might say it’s a magic ring.
 Chandler:Well I think it all started when you said Hey Joey why don’t you be my best man.
 Chandler:Well what if we just ah called her used a fake name and had her come to my office?
 Chandler:(to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all turn there backs on her.)
 Chandler:Way to be cool man.
 Chandler:Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)
 Chandler:He will Joe.
 Chandler:Hey come on it’s not your fault.
 Chandler:No you should.
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:Thanks man.
 Chandler:What a baby.
 Chandler:Six-hour trip to London. That’s a lot of Monica.
 Chandler:You got your passport?
 Chandler:There it is.
 Chandler:(entering with Joey) All right! Let’s do it!
 Chandler:Okay ‘cause that’s not gonna get annoying.
 Chandler:Hey y’know what? I was wrong.
 Chandler:Hey! (Trots over)
 Chandler:Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebe’s book as Rachel comes in from her room.)
 Chandler:(entering with Phoebe’s book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
 Chandler:I am I’m ignoring you.
 Chandler:Oh what the hell is that?
 Chandler:Okay if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
 Chandler:Okay. Listen-listen we’re not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
 Chandler:I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.
 Chandler:To Put the Camera Away!!!
 Chandler:Well I don’t have to buy that I’m with stupid T-shirt anymore.
 Chandler:All right look you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?
 Chandler:How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?
 Chandler:Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
 Chandler:All right look if you insist on wearing that in public y’know you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
 Chandler:Okay wait. All right that’s it okay I’m out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box falls into a flower stand and walks away trying to be cool.)
 Chandler:Hey. (He nods at the hat.)
 Chandler:No-no-no y’know what? I really shouldn’t have said that you were embarrassing me I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel any better I’ve had a really lousy day.
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:That’s… That’s was…
 Chandler:How did you? How? How?
 Chandler:I’m gonna go to the bathroom.
 Chandler:That was pretty intense huh?
 Chandler:(glares at him) I hope he did!
 Chandler:Joey it’s been three days okay.. Your just a little homesick Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just just try to enjoy yourself.
 Chandler:I’d like to toast Ross and Emily. Of course my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast if you will. (No one in the room laughs. He starts to get flustered.) Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (Ross looks embarrassed.) And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he over inflated her. (He laughs. Jack looks at Judy and no one in the room laughs.) Ohh Dear God.. (A cellular phone rings.)
 Chandler:(Continuing his toast.) And I’m sure we’re all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think my friend getting married in Monty Hall. (No reaction from the people.) Ohh come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on you people!! All right forget it!! Congratulations Ross and Emily. (He sits down.)
 Chandler:Out loud?
 Chandler:So how are you doing?
 Chandler:The guy was hammered okay? There’s no way you look like Ross’s mother.
 Chandler:Because he’s crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
 Chandler:Ahh you know what? That is....Who wouldn’t want you?
 Chandler:(With the covers pulled up to his chin.) Morning Ross.
 Chandler:Yeah you are!!
 Chandler:Well I’ve-I’ve never done that with you before.
 Chandler:So ahh how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
 Chandler:Yes...Yes..Uh-huh You?(Looking over at her. She looks back.) We did you.
 Chandler:Oh yea yea absolutely.
 Chandler:I don’t want to look.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:(Very defensive.) I’m not seeing Monica.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Oh my god!
 Chandler:No!! Okay!! What’s with the third degree?! Why don’t you just shine a light in my eyes?! (Joey looks totally confused.)
 Chandler:Oh yea your right. It’s the second one.
 Chandler:What we did last night was....
 Chandler:Totally crazy stupid. (He nods his head at the people seated.)
 Chandler:I’m coming over tonight though right?
 Chandler:It could’ve been worse he could’ve shot her.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh wow I hope you don’t take this the wrong way but I know we had plans to meet up tonight and ugh I’m just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
 Chandler:Seven times!
 Chandler:In a foreign romantic country…
 Chandler:Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)
 Chandler:Well I don’t see that we have a choice. But when we’re back home we don’t do it.
 Chandler:Y’know I saw a wine cellar downstairs…
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Forget it that’s off.
 Chandler:The man’s got a point.
 Chandler:Listen in the middle of everything if I scream the word Yippee! just ignore me.
 Chandler:Oh hello Rachel.
 Chandler:Yes we do. But we have to change first.
 Chandler:Yeah we’ll be down in like five minutes.
 Chandler:Oh yay…
 Chandler:(To Monica) Hey listen why don’t we go change in my room?
 Chandler:Wow you look…
 Chandler:Well I’ve got a girl in here.
 Chandler:Well we’re-we’re hanging out in here!
 Chandler:Well I suppose I’d have to say you!! But what if we’re watching a movie in here?
 Chandler:Well Ross and Emily aren’t gonna use it.
 Chandler:Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn’t get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Nope not under here!
 Chandler:Well you couldn’t have looked everywhere or else you would’ve found her!
 Chandler:Yeah for about 30 minutes.
 Chandler:Wow in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)
 Chandler:Yeah we’re gonna go.
 Chandler:Yeah it’s a very large plane.
 Chandler:But we’ll stay here with you.
 Chandler:We have to leave for New York in an hour.
 Chandler:We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know let’s go for it.
 Chandler:Yeah it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something) Y’know technically we still are over international waters.
 Chandler:‘Kay!
 Chandler:Uhh no.
 Chandler:No.
 Chandler:Yes.
 Chandler:Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:No we didn’t!
 Chandler:Yes! Good thing we have that ‘Not in New York’ rule.
 Chandler:Right.
 Chandler:Oh. Y’know that night meant a lot to me too and it wasn’t because I was in a bad place or anything it just meant a lot to me ‘cause you’re really hot! Is that okay?
 Chandler:And I’m cute too.
 Chandler:Thank you! (They hug.) All right I gotta go unpack.
 Chandler:Bye.
 Chandler:(entering) I’m still on London time does that count?
 Chandler:Oh good! (They start kissing.)
 Chandler:Ehh you're just liquored up.
 Chandler:I've had a very long hard day.
 Chandler:Ahh no thanks. No chicken bye-bye then.
 Chandler:For the last time no! Get out! Get out Joey!
 Chandler:Are you okay? I'm so sorry he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
 Chandler:Hey Joe!
 Chandler:Yeah can I get a 3-piece some cole slaw some beans and a Coke-(Yelps in
 Chandler:Hey Pheebs!
 Chandler:Uh The Wheatsheaf.
 Chandler:Ooh! Ahh Pheebs was gonna tell a story.
 Chandler:I can't believe she can out run you man!
 Chandler:Oh Ross when you make out card; be sure to make it out to EM-I-LY.
 Chandler:Oh that's not true.
 Chandler:Okay I gotta go to work.
 Chandler:And uh Rachel glad to have you back.
 Chandler:Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe who is also stunned.) Always a pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)
 Chandler:All right y'know what we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
 Chandler:I got caught up and work but I'm quitting tomorrow.
 Chandler:So thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over grabs her and kisses her.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly grabs her and kisses her.)
 Chandler:Well I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. (Gets up to leave.)
 Chandler:I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
 Chandler:Hey Pheebs!
 Chandler:Okay Pheebs we decided the picnic idea was a little… Y'know it didn't have any… It-it well it blew. So we thought that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to Atlantic City!
 Chandler:Atlantic City!
 Chandler:Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
 Chandler:I know it's beautiful. Amazing.
 Chandler:Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
 Chandler:No.
 Chandler:Okay. (They kiss again.)
 Chandler:That's right.
 Chandler:Oh no.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Hey! You okay?
 Chandler:Did he just say he loves Fonzie?
 Chandler:All right…
 Chandler:Yeah that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month they give you 2% financing.
 Chandler:Really? Male nurses?
 Chandler:So they're going on dates? When?
 Chandler:This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too is that uh is that another doctor?
 Chandler:All right.
 Chandler:(spotting her) Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
 Chandler:Oh is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah Joey already told me and I am so-so fine. I mean you and I we're just y'know we're nothing we're goofin' around.
 Chandler:Fine! Maybe I will too!
 Chandler:So Dan nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
 Chandler:Oh.
 Chandler:Sure. (Pause) And listen thanks for doing that for us by the way. (Retreats in defeat.)
 Chandler:(to another female nurse) Hey how 'bout it? You me Saturday night?
 Chandler:All right. Very good.
 Chandler:Bye momi-moo.
 Chandler:Yes!
 Chandler:Oh God kindergarten flashback.
 Chandler:Okay keep saying it!
 Chandler:So are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
 Chandler:Y'know I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary… Well I have and the technical definition is two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me then we have to y'know get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
 Chandler:Really? Okay so…
 Chandler:Y'know I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
 Chandler:Right!
 Chandler:So uh now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl what are they gonna name her?
 Chandler:That's kind of a masculine name don't you think?
 Chandler:(entering happily with a bottle of champagne thinking that Monica is the only one there) Ha-ha-ha-(sees everyone)-enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no-no-no-no vomit tux! No-no vomit tux!
 Chandler:Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
 Chandler:Uhh yeah. She uh she uh she uh might've mentioned him.
 Chandler:Yeah I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
 Chandler:Really?! That's what you heard? (To Monica) You said that?
 Chandler:Because I'm very happy for him! (To Monica) And you you lucky dog!
 Chandler:Yes!
 Chandler:(entering) Hey Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
 Chandler:If you're cooking on the stove does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
 Chandler:Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had I'd be going like this. (He jumps up onto the table and starts doing his happy dance.)
 Chandler:Yes!
 Chandler:Well you can't just not see Rachel anymore she's one of your best friends.
 Chandler:That's true!
 Chandler:That's true!
 Chandler:Hey there he is! There he is!
 Chandler:How many times have I told you guys you never watch the cooking channel!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Oh that was yours? Uh yeah we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
 Chandler:Expect it in 4-6 weeks. (She starts to leave.) Umm hey umm Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day we have the whole place to ourselves.
 Chandler:Well I just thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:What's your point?
 Chandler:(entering) Look maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best it's only because you've made me the best.
 Chandler:I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you and we're together OH…MY…GOD.
 Chandler:Oh-aw my God! Now I understand if you never want to sleep with me again but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it to sex!
 Chandler:Well I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts to take off her latex gloves.) Oh no-no-no leave the gloves on.
 Chandler:Yeah why don't we lose the gloves.
 Chandler:All right let's show them how it's done.
 Chandler:Y'know that wasn't part of it?
 Chandler:Nope.
 Chandler:(quietly) Hi! (They both start kissing.)
 Chandler:Uhh 9. (He pushes the clock into the sink.)
 Chandler:I know me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
 Chandler:Yeah I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
 Chandler:Okay y'know your not though. Let's go. (He starts for his bedroom.)
 Chandler:I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
 Chandler:What's going on?
 Chandler:Uh hey!
 Chandler:We're flipping Monica's mattress.
 Chandler:Aww man! (They go into Monica's room.)
 Chandler:Oh yes somebody just said Can you hear anything?
 Chandler:Condoms?
 Chandler:And condoms are the way to do that?
 Chandler:(jumping on the bed) I can't believe it! We're here!
 Chandler:Oh you should live with Joey Roll-os everywhere.
 Chandler:Oh yes! Monica get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
 Chandler:(looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God they gave us glasses!
 Chandler:Okay but let's do it now though because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)
 Chandler:Okay great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)
 Chandler:Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
 Chandler:What? Why?
 Chandler:Uh-huh. (He doesn't take his eyes off the TV.)
 Chandler:(turning to face her) Yeah.
 Chandler:I hear ya Mugsy! But look all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect magical weekend together with you.
 Chandler:(watching TV in fact ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
 Chandler:Oh I'm sorry am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
 Chandler:Oh who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
 Chandler:Do not speak ill of the dead.
 Chandler:I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez relax mom.
 Chandler:I said Geez relax Monnnnn.
 Chandler:Damn Rollos!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know the entire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another Rollo)
 Chandler:Uh no I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
 Chandler:Well maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
 Chandler:Monica. (Follows her out.)
 Chandler:Okay fine $300.
 Chandler:Yeah just think of it as $25 per room!
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:Okay Ross is in the bathroom.
 Chandler:Kip my old roommate y'know we all used to hang out together.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:Yes that was mine.
 Chandler:Yes that would have made more sense.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked huh?
 Chandler:So I guess this is over.
 Chandler:Well y'know you and me it had to end sometime.
 Chandler:Because of the weekend we had a fight.
 Chandler:So this isn't over?
 Chandler:Really? Okay. Great!
 Chandler:(stops her) We're in a relationship?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Joey can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to drag Joey into Monica's room.)
 Chandler:Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.)
 Chandler:It happened in London.
 Chandler:The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
 Chandler:No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
 Chandler:Fun's over!
 Chandler:Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
 Chandler:Sorry.
 Chandler:Hello!
 Chandler:Yeah just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.) That didn't happen I made that up!
 Chandler:Okay but don't you think this is a little extreme?
 Chandler:Yeah I know we're losing Ross Joey said hence…
 Chandler:You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
 Chandler:So you're really okay with this?
 Chandler:Now that's so funny because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
 Chandler:Okay what is in here? Rocks?
 Chandler:So rocks.
 Chandler:Look we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
 Chandler:Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
 Chandler:Well I think it's very brave what you said.
 Chandler:Pheebs what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
 Chandler:Uh Ross?
 Chandler:Yeah we are so sorry.
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:Oh yeah there-there she is!
 Chandler:Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
 Chandler:That's a pig.
 Chandler:Hey! (Joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
 Chandler:Oh yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
 Chandler:He thought you said gonad.
 Chandler:Love what you've done with the place.
 Chandler:Oh yeah!
 Chandler:Oh the tears are real.
 Chandler:What are you doing?
 Chandler:You built a fort didn't ya?
 Chandler:(notices something) Oh my God the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)
 Chandler:I hate this thing!
 Chandler:(entering) Hello children!
 Chandler:Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)
 Chandler:Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
 Chandler:You mean this. (Does the maneuver perfectly.)
 Chandler:(gasps) All right look y'know this maybe tough but come on this is Ross! I survived college with him!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:No-no-no-no!
 Chandler:Okay so he's out of here.
 Chandler:Well I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
 Chandler:Not even on page 7?
 Chandler:What about that circled one?
 Chandler:Yes it is.
 Chandler:There we go!
 Chandler:Let's go quicker.
 Chandler:Yeah well look at this kitchen slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
 Chandler:Yeah you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
 Chandler:It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
 Chandler:We are bad people.
 Chandler:Yes that was a nice place!
 Chandler:Not a lot of closet space but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
 Chandler:What are we gonna do?
 Chandler:About Ross!
 Chandler:(grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh barks into the night. (Listens.) Well who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah he's a tap dancer! (Listens.) Yes some would say that is a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp! (Listens.) There you go! Yes he's a pimp. He's a big tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello?
 Chandler:Ohhhhh!
 Chandler:98. 99. 100. Okay go!
 Chandler:Here we go! Here we go!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:You're kidding no!
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:Yes! Ross you have to stay!
 Chandler:All right buddy!
 Chandler:Well I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
 Chandler:All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?
 Chandler:That's sweet Joey.
 Chandler:Are you aware that you're still talking?
 Chandler:No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
 Chandler:It's a tradition like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay moved out and abandoned its entire family.
 Chandler:Really? Worse than More turkey Mr. Chandler?
 Chandler:It's exactly like it sounds.
 Chandler:Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him but Chandler is in the doorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)
 Chandler:I'm over here big guy.
 Chandler:(laughing) You did look like an idiot.
 Chandler:Oh come on Monica reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know for me anyway. And of course the Indians.
 Chandler:(seeing her) Okay.
 Chandler:Well as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it I'm in.
 Chandler:Oh yeah it was great. You should be a chef.
 Chandler:Emotional Knapsack?
 Chandler:Right on! Oh! Uh but don’t take to long okay? 'Cause uh we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight right Clifford Alverez.
 Chandler:Dude don't do that too me!
 Chandler:No it's not that I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
 Chandler:I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
 Chandler:I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
 Chandler:I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so so sorry.
 Chandler:We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
 Chandler:Yeah we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:You just you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
 Chandler:Sorry!
 Chandler:Sorry.
 Chandler:Monica I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Are you all right?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Without my toe?! I need my toe!
 Chandler:That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
 Chandler:That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
 Chandler:Yeah well I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (He storms out.)
 Chandler:I can't believe this.
 Chandler:Yeah well sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
 Chandler:Yeah just leave me alone for a while. (He goes into his apartment.)
 Chandler:Oh-oh I'm a duck! I go Quack quack! I’m happy all the time!
 Chandler:Nice try.
 Chandler:Look Monica…
 Chandler:This is not going to work.
 Chandler:You are so great! I love you!
 Chandler:Nothing! I said I said You're so great and then I just I just stopped talking!
 Chandler:No I didn't!
 Chandler:No I didn't!
 Chandler:No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
 Chandler:Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another but can't) I'm out.
 Chandler:Well they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
 Chandler:See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:(interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too.
 Chandler:Well yeah actually.
 Chandler:I know it sounds really weird but we're just so bad at relationships.
 Chandler:Help!
 Chandler:Hi Pheebs!
 Chandler:I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
 Chandler:Well what did the police say?
 Chandler:Ross it's just a sandwich!
 Chandler:(reading) Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch who? Ross Geller's lunch please don't take me. Okay?
 Chandler:Say Ross when you picture Phoebe living on the street is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
 Chandler:What is going on here?
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:No-no wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your (Thinks) adult film class.
 Chandler:Oh—I don't know.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:(gasps) You're naked in this picture!
 Chandler:Ross?
 Chandler:Which I may say right now is out of control.
 Chandler:And you're okay with that?
 Chandler:(Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)
 Chandler:All right look! Look. I think I can explain this.
 Chandler:Joey's a sex addict.
 Chandler:Well let's….let's see what everybody thinks of that?
 Chandler:Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
 Chandler:(Answering the phone at work) Hello Chandler Bing.
 Chandler:(Angrily) Alright whoever this is stop calling me! (Ross and Joey laugh silently.) It’s been six months! It’s not funny!
 Chandler:Leave me alone! For the love of God leave me alone!!! (Joey hangs up.)
 Chandler:The British are coming?
 Chandler:Ohh.
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:Yes! Chandler Bing 7! Chandler Bing 0.
 Chandler:Okay I'll stop.
 Chandler:You wanna play?
 Chandler:Well so play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
 Chandler:I'm intrigued.
 Chandler:Okay but be careful okay because I wanna get our security deposit back.
 Chandler:Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
 Chandler:(entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven mitts) Oh yeah it's great! See you take a tennis ball a bowl and some lighter fluid—Op! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)
 Chandler:(entering from his bedroom) Guys come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on Joe!
 Chandler:Well why can't you do them tomorrow?
 Chandler:(To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit he'll get some work done.
 Chandler:The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
 Chandler:Oh so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
 Chandler:I paid for those tickets!
 Chandler:Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)
 Chandler:When did that happen to you?!
 Chandler:Oh yeah. First off all chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
 Chandler:Okay bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!
 Chandler:I don't believe they're brother and sister.
 Chandler:Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street you wanna go down there and give them a project ruin their day?
 Chandler:Great! Now we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!
 Chandler:Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
 Chandler:All right. (Takes a copy.)
 Chandler:What is up?
 Chandler:No it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
 Chandler:Could I be more sorry. (Looks at Joey.)
 Chandler:(To Ross) I'm sorry too.
 Chandler:I am sorry Ross.
 Chandler:This took you all day?!
 Chandler:(deadpan standing next to Monica) We're very happy for you.
 Chandler:We wanted to kiss at midnight but nobody else is going to so y'know…
 Chandler:(To Monica) Happy New Year!
 Chandler:Do you want us to leave the room or?
 Chandler:That's good one too Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
 Chandler:I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what paying me the 50 bucks could be the new thing you do that day! (Ross looks at him.) And it starts right now!
 Chandler:Nice!
 Chandler:(reading it) Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
 Chandler:Horn-swoggle.
 Chandler:No. No I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. (Sits down rubbing his temple.)
 Chandler:What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing I myself find it regular.
 Chandler:(notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause no one speaks.) Someone comment on the pants!
 Chandler:That's not what I had in mind! See people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see they're very tight. (Motions to Ross's buttock.) Maybe there's something in that area.
 Chandler:Oh come on!! (Storms out.)
 Chandler:(on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Oh yeah me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. (Smells it.) Yep.
 Chandler:(entering) Oh good okay I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross phone call for you today Tom Jones he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?! (He sits down and sighs in relief.)
 Chandler:Sorry man.
 Chandler:Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
 Chandler:Oh we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
 Chandler:I know I can do this. (He takes her hand.)
 Chandler:I asked myself that very question sir. Uh (Points to Monica) this is Monica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss Doug. Doug this is Monica.
 Chandler:No sir.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Oh that was my work laugh.
 Chandler:Oh believe me to survive this party you're gonna have to come up with one too.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
 Chandler:And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. (She glares at him.) Strip church. Anyway I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
 Chandler:Oh I used too but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at…bigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) Hey Rach do you have a tennis racquet?
 Chandler:Okay good luck with that. (Exits.)
 Chandler:Okay easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
 Chandler:Let them win one.
 Chandler:You're not even giving them a chance!
 Chandler:Oh yes sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? (Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!
 Chandler:Oopsey missed it!
 Chandler:Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)
 Chandler:Yeah at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashed racquet from his bag.)
 Chandler:It was my racquet.
 Chandler:If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
 Chandler:Okay y'know what because you said that I'm not putting out tonight.
 Chandler:Just a little bit of sugar.
 Chandler:Oh you get used to it.
 Chandler:So I laugh at my boss's jokes what's the big deal?
 Chandler:Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Well I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
 Chandler:Well I just…
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you Monica.
 Chandler:Coffee in a fight! (Does the laugh again.)
 Chandler:(from his bedroom) All right so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
 Chandler:But we're not ready to tell yet!
 Chandler:Man she is really gullible.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Why would I be mad?
 Chandler:(realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said all on the list there. Well but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
 Chandler:I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
 Chandler:And I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) seven dollars. No strings attached. Now if you can't remember that I think we should write it down—let's write it down!
 Chandler:Oh! Look at that time's up! My turn!
 Chandler:It's your timer.
 Chandler:All right then massage me up right nice!
 Chandler:Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
 Chandler:It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
 Chandler:Good-bye muscles!!
 Chandler:I'm telling you she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just—I didn't know what it was!
 Chandler:Look for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know telling the truth.
 Chandler:(examining the hat) And the bunny got away. (Turns and starts looking for the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)
 Chandler:And you're gonna make them all disappear.
 Chandler:Done.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
 Chandler:Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:And a date with a man!
 Chandler:(wincing) Yes he is!
 Chandler:I'm sorry but ow-owww-owww!
 Chandler:Hey is Rachel here?
 Chandler:(coming all the way in) Listen I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
 Chandler:(falling into that trap) I don't like your massages.
 Chandler:Okay but now see you're crying!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:It's okay you don't have to be the best at everything.
 Chandler:Okay you give the worst massages in the world.
 Chandler:Okay hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves Who's the best of that? They'd have to go to you.
 Chandler:Oh it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
 Chandler:Absolutely!
 Chandler:Yeah! (They hug.)
 Chandler:Hey man how did the audition go?
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Oh hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)
 Chandler:Yeah umm they're called wallets.
 Chandler:And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
 Chandler:Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
 Chandler:(entering) Hello children!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:Well I try to y'know squeeze things. (Phoebe giggles uncontrollably.) Are you okay?
 Chandler:Phoebe it's me. You can tell me anything.
 Chandler:What's going on?
 Chandler:Well my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
 Chandler:Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
 Chandler:The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house I think I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
 Chandler:I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
 Chandler:Ow!
 Chandler:Oh y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
 Chandler:No I didn't misunderstand okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
 Chandler:Well it's not flexed right now!
 Chandler:Sure I'll do it with ya.
 Chandler:That new mountain bike?
 Chandler:Your work makes me sad.
 Chandler:(after they've left) Okay did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
 Chandler:Okay so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
 Chandler:Are you serious?
 Chandler:(a little hurt) Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps—She knows!
 Chandler:(entering) Joey!
 Chandler:Phoebe knows about us!
 Chandler:Oh man!
 Chandler:Ahh yes the messers become the messies!
 Chandler:Hello Phoebe I've been thinking about you all day. (He's holding the phone so that Monica can hear it as well.)
 Chandler:Well you know that thing you said before I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
 Chandler:Yeah listen Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
 Chandler:Oh yeah they're totally gonna back down!
 Chandler:(initially worried but gets over it) Really?
 Chandler:Yes.
 Chandler:Okay listen how far am I gonna have to go with her?
 Chandler:How do you know?!
 Chandler:At this?!
 Chandler:Phoebe.
 Chandler:Come on in.
 Chandler:Sure.
 Chandler:Me? No. You?
 Chandler:So do I.
 Chandler:I'm gonna put on some music.
 Chandler:You look good.
 Chandler:Well why don't we move this into the bedroom?
 Chandler:Oh do you not want to?
 Chandler:(swallowing hard) Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
 Chandler:Listen this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
 Chandler:Look she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)
 Chandler:Okay give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
 Chandler:Oh you're-you're going?
 Chandler:(swallowing hard) It's very very nice. Well come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
 Chandler:Not if I kiss you first.
 Chandler:Well I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
 Chandler:Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
 Chandler:Because I'm in love with Monica!!
 Chandler:Love her! That's right I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you Monica.
 Chandler:And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. (Pause) And might I say your breasts are still showing.
 Chandler:Yes and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Wow! Listen we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So good-bye take care bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)
 Chandler:Oh I'm going on the lamb.
 Chandler:Well I think I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
 Chandler:Look we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay I'm in love with her.
 Chandler:(interrupting) Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
 Chandler:Yeah big zero gravity moon steps.
 Chandler:Hey listen come on Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
 Chandler:(To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.
 Chandler:Very very funny but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
 Chandler:Wh-wh-why?!
 Chandler:Yeah so what's that supposed to mean?!
 Chandler:I don't see it that way. Okay? Because I see two Monicas the one that was my friend who lived across the hall and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica who I just started to date. Now who's to say what she wants?! I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?
 Chandler:Okay. It's not different at all is it?
 Chandler:Hmm.
 Chandler:Yeah here somewhere else y'know where-where ever. (Gets up.)
 Chandler:Yeah I'm cool. Casual.
 Chandler:I'm just hanging out. Y'know having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:Well you do want all that stuff right?
 Chandler:Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
 Chandler:Oh please you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
 Chandler:Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
 Chandler:Well I did not know that.
 Chandler:It's gonna be okay right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is this is fixable.
 Chandler:By me?
 Chandler:Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)
 Chandler:Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
 Chandler:Well that's what we do. Y'know I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
 Chandler:Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
 Chandler:I need to talk to you it's urgent!
 Chandler:Okay I've been doing a lot of thinking about us y'know a lot of uhh us thinking. And uh well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly and awkwardly gets down on one knee.)
 Chandler:(getting out a ring box) Monica…
 Chandler:Will you marry me?
 Chandler:I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
 Chandler:I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
 Chandler:No the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.) Will you be my wife?
 Chandler:Yeah I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
 Chandler:Yeah I know but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)
 Chandler:I didn't think I was!
 Chandler:Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door. (Points at the door.)
 Chandler:Okay how long is this going to go on.
 Chandler:That's not funny.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Oh we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey do you know a six-letter word for red?
 Chandler:Yeah I think that's wrong but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. (To Monica) Hey how about maroon?
 Chandler:Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Oh y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow his mother was shot by a hunter.
 Chandler:Okay but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
 Chandler:Hi Joe.
 Chandler:Oh come on! You've been acting strange all day!
 Chandler:Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! I don’t want to talk about it.
 Chandler:You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh that is so cool! (To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. (Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) I love you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)
 Chandler:No it can mean anything. Like uh all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
 Chandler:Joey look are you attracted to Monica? Right here right now are you attracted to her?
 Chandler:Well there you have it!
 Chandler:Well y'know Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
 Chandler:Oh yeah it's actually in my bedroom.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:Y'know I would be offended but Monica is freakishly strong so…
 Chandler:(looking at the sketch) Oh I see. I thought you just really really liked your new couch.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:(straining) Okay.
 Chandler:Okay I don't think we can turn anymore!
 Chandler:Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
 Chandler:Okay yeah I think it's really stuck now.
 Chandler:Oh y'know what did you mean when you said pivot?
 Chandler:(stopping him) Hey whoa-whoa! What's she like?
 Chandler:Ooh I do! I do! I do!
 Chandler:(To Rachel) He has a gun!
 Chandler:(entering) Hey Monica here's your broom back.
 Chandler:Oh hey how'd the interview go?
 Chandler:So what happened?
 Chandler:Well you coulda tried not kissing him.
 Chandler:Come on Rach.
 Chandler:I gotta check out this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizes something stops turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her and kisses her.)
 Chandler:(To Gary) So what do you say maybe sometime I hold your gun?
 Chandler:Oh what can happen? I mean would you… (He gestures and spills some of his coffee.)
 Chandler:Uh yeah.
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:Ohh so?
 Chandler:Monica you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this why? Get your coat.
 Chandler:That was amazing!
 Chandler:That was amazing.
 Chandler:No you're the best.
 Chandler:No you're the best.
 Chandler:Honey the tortilla chips know what you mean.
 Chandler:Oh yeah it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to the lining.) Now I gotta go Officer Bing has gotta 10-100. (Pause softly) That's pee-pee. (Heads for the bathroom.)
 Chandler:Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?
 Chandler:No. And if I did I don't think we'd be going out. Monica this is getting ridiculous!
 Chandler:Ugh we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
 Chandler:(gasps) So?
 Chandler:Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
 Chandler:Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth I'm more excited about where we are right now.
 Chandler:Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you yeah I think that's pretty exciting. (Kisses her.)
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
 Chandler:Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
 Chandler:Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy irrational screw up! (Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at him.) And now we're back.
 Chandler:(entering) You guys ready fore the movies?
 Chandler:Okay. (He picks the 9 of Spades)
 Chandler:Oh yes.
 Chandler:(pause) Yes.

 Chandler:Hey Rach now that you're working at Ralph Lauren can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
 Chandler:Unwilling to steal from work interesting.

 Chandler:Ah sure. What's in 'em?
 Chandler:Oh good because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
 Chandler:Y'know I rued the day once…didn't get a whole lot else done.
 Chandler:(shocked) Well I mean let me get the door first. (Goes and opens the door.) Oh hi! No one. (Exits.)
 Chandler:Okay there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
 Chandler:Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
 Chandler:I wish I had smoked for my career…
 Chandler:Okay but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!

 Chandler:Great job with the cups Pheebs!

 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary we've got reservations at Ja George.
 Chandler:Made a few calls pulled some strings and they agreed to seat us at 1130 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
 Chandler:Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
 Chandler:Yeah if that was true gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
 Chandler:Oh okay. (Hands her the money.) Here you go.
 Chandler:Oh he's in the back. The duck pissed him off said that eggs came first.
 Chandler:Okay bye!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:I was not flirting.
 Chandler:Okay first of all the impression uncanny. And second that was not flirting that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
 Chandler:You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to move towards Ross.)
 Chandler:I was not flirting.
 Chandler:I was not and oh God shh!
 Chandler:Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
 Chandler:So Joey on Law & Order you must be very proud!
 Chandler:I'm sorry I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She just stares at him.) I've done it again.
 Chandler:Happy Anniversary 10 months! (They kiss.)
 Chandler:Uhh Joey's grandmother is right there. (Points)
 Chandler:The one that doesn't.
 Chandler:Hey why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:If you said Big lima bean bubbling up. Would she understand the difference?
 Chandler:Here you go. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
 Chandler:You're welcome.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.
 Chandler:Really?!
 Chandler:(starts to laugh but then gets serious) So umm you-you flirt with guys all the time?
 Chandler:Okay but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
 Chandler:Yes it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel when you were going out with Ross did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
 Chandler:(smiling) Well what is it?
 Chandler:(smiling) If we keep talking this way aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
 Chandler:Doesn't know Hello. But she knows Capricorn One.
 Chandler:So uh Monica do you do you like the Law & Order?
 Chandler:See I'm finding out all this stuff about you today like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
 Chandler:Oh I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look I'm sorry some things are different for men and for women.
 Chandler:Okay I've already taught you so much already but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think I'm just flirting no big deal. But the guy is thinking Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!
 Chandler:It's true.
 Chandler:Again true.
 Chandler:All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
 Chandler:Uh Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to pantomime it for her.) Meanwhile let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So you're old and small.
 Chandler:Okay hold on. (Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)
 Chandler:(To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt we don't have a problem.
 Chandler:Oh the humanity.
 Chandler:More so than anything else.
 Chandler:Almost over man.
 Chandler:Why am I looking?
 Chandler:You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
 Chandler:(singing) Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown…engines…on!
 Chandler:(To Monica) Hey!
 Chandler:You ready?
 Chandler:You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
 Chandler:Let me see the earrings.
 Chandler:(looking at them) They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
 Chandler:(To Ross) Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
 Chandler:Hey man what's up?
 Chandler:Yeah yeah! Me too!
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Well I like danger.
 Chandler:Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
 Chandler:It is starting to get dark out there.
 Chandler:(laughing) Okay. (Deadpan) But it is officially nighttime.
 Chandler:Your tax dollars?
 Chandler:(leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich) Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
 Chandler:I can't smell your sandwich?
 Chandler:Okay I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joey just glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Sur-surprise him? We're not we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
 Chandler:How do you figure that?
 Chandler:Y'know when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It it sounds gay.
 Chandler:Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
 Chandler:Okay y'know we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
 Chandler:(deadpan) Oh hurry up. I want to sign that.
 Chandler:What's going on?
 Chandler:Uh HELLO!!
 Chandler:(pouting) It was a car backfire!
 Chandler:Who jumps at loud noises!
 Chandler:Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (He gets up and starts for the door.)
 Chandler:(returning) Oh my God! (Storms out.)
 Chandler:Oh I just went for a walk around the living room. Whatever…
 Chandler:No. No I'm just tired. Y'know from-from the walk.
 Chandler:You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
 Chandler:I do not hate Ross!
 Chandler:What picture?
 Chandler:Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire but y'know it could've been a bullet and you y'know you didn't try to save me!
 Chandler:When it comes down to it you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
 Chandler:From a bullet!
 Chandler:Much sense?!
 Chandler:So you risked your life for a sandwich!
 Chandler:So you didn't uh choose Ross before me.
 Chandler:Really?!
 Chandler:Thanks. (He grabs the sandwich.)
 Chandler:(with his mouthful) Oh-oi-ho yeah!
 Chandler:Hm-hmm. (Goes to take another bite.)
 Chandler:I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
 Chandler:Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
 Chandler:Yes if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Yeah see I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Hiya doin' pumpkin?
 Chandler:(terrified) Right because it's fast. Because it's so fast. It's fast!
 Chandler:Oh! Good for you Pheebs way to go! (Breathes a sigh of relief)
 Chandler:So what are you gonna do?
 Chandler:Me?! Why me?
 Chandler:I'll try but I'm not sure what good it would do y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
 Chandler:(To Phoebe behind Monica's back) Still terrified I'll take care of it. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her when she turns away he nods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)
 Chandler:Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.)
 Chandler:Gary I'm here to report a crime.
 Chandler:It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
 Chandler:Well I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe we should have a talk. Man to uh me.
 Chandler:Uh are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe you two are gonna be y'know live-living together!
 Chandler:You mean scared.
 Chandler:Scared? Happy?
 Chandler:I am trying to open your eyes my man! Don't you see if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home she's there. You go to bed she's there. You wake up and oh yes she's there!
 Chandler:Were you're parents happy or something?
 Chandler:Wow y'know when you say it it doesn't sound so scary.
 Chandler:Yeah I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
 Chandler:(pause) Yeah you're right about that.
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:Yes I did and I think you should do it.
 Chandler:He's a great guy y'know? And he loves you a lot you are a very lucky lady.
 Chandler:I’m sorry. (Pause) If you ask me I'd move in with him.
 Chandler:Hey Gar!
 Chandler:Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
 Chandler:All right let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in the game.)
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:I'm not a dropper!
 Chandler:It's throwing and catching!
 Chandler:Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball but loses control and almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)
 Chandler:Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
 Chandler:Yeah you almost overreacted to something.
 Chandler:Not fun anymore?
 Chandler:Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is you can work it out!
 Chandler:Oh that is over!
 Chandler:You guys wanna eat here?
 Chandler:Y'know how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football a mug of coffee the phone an apple a Frisbee a record and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his chest. I'm not going to describe them you'll have to see them.)
 Chandler:Oh Richard. That's all I ever hear Richard Richard Richard!
 Chandler:Okay so Richard Richard!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:How much did I love The King and I? (Oh you get the point by now.)
 Chandler:You okay there man?
 Chandler:Wow umm calm down.
 Chandler:Uh no Pheebs. What's it look like?
 Chandler:You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
 Chandler:Yeah I know that means buddy!
 Chandler:Well uh we can talk about that too Pheebs.
 Chandler:Whoa-whoa-whoa what are we going to do about my job?
 Chandler:All right great road trip baby! (To Monica) This okay with you?
 Chandler:Thank you.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:Yeah listen how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Hey so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
 Chandler:I see but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite right? I mean lead in a movie they must be paying you a lot?
 Chandler:So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
 Chandler:All right bye-bye now!
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:We've been driving for a half-hour and you haven't looked at the road once.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Isn't that Ross's money?
 Chandler:I don't know.
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Too dry.
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:Yes.
 Chandler:I also said Yes!
 Chandler:No! (Realizes) Ahhh!!!
 Chandler:Look Joe I just I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
 Chandler:They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
 Chandler:Joe I don't think this is going to be your big break.
 Chandler:Oh you don't want me on the trip?
 Chandler:All right I'll tell ya what the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
 Chandler:All right fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
 Chandler:You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
 Chandler:All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait there's no sidewalk! Yeah I'm gonna die here.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
 Chandler:I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
 Chandler:Well I don't know what mad him so mad y'know? All I said was that uh I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him and that uh y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
 Chandler:Oh I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
 Chandler:(who has just entered) Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
 Chandler:Y'know he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
 Chandler:That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of porn…
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:(To Phoebe) Is that Joey?! (She nods yes) Let me talk to him!
 Chandler:(To Phoebe) Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
 Chandler:(To Joey) Hey!
 Chandler:No-no-no-no I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
 Chandler:Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
 Chandler:Uh what was that?
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
 Chandler:Huh.
 Chandler:Oh but it's not 'til tomorrow!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Wow!
 Chandler:Do we have to?
 Chandler:Okay this is great but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
 Chandler:Yeah I think we should see other people.
 Chandler:Yes.
 Chandler:It's a great idea. (They kiss)
 Chandler:Y'know Pheebs it's kinda our (His and Monica's) anniversary.
 Chandler:(coughing) Art lover!
 Chandler:I said art lover.
 Chandler:I don't know I'm very tired.
 Chandler:So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
 Chandler:Yeah I guess it's a little better now.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Happy plane-aversary.
 Chandler:Can I give you a present now?
 Chandler:Okay! (He grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) Oh man! Don’t tell me I did this!
 Chandler:How do you feel about the I really did forgot the present please forgive me not fake out?
 Chandler:Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
 Chandler:What-what Richard thing?
 Chandler:What Richard thing?
 Chandler:(talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.
 Chandler:Oh yeah! Yeah so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)
 Chandler:Oh my God.
 Chandler:Love your condoms my man.
 Chandler:Why?! What happened?!
 Chandler:No-no that's okay apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
 Chandler:No! Her boyfriend Richard!
 Chandler:When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
 Chandler:Thanks. (They hug.)
 Chandler:(pushing her away from another hug) Next time?
 Chandler:There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
 Chandler:That's so funny because I think I just did!
 Chandler:Fine with me!
 Chandler:What are you talking…
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:(interrupting in the nick of time) Joey I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
 Chandler:Whoa!
 Chandler:Y'know if I won $5000 I'd join a gym y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick! (Mimics it.)
 Chandler:Good luck!
 Chandler:I see.
 Chandler:(totally confused) What?
 Chandler:What's an identical hand twin?
 Chandler:Are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?
 Chandler:(totally confused) How?
 Chandler:Again I must go back to how?
 Chandler:(Pause) Y'know I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
 Chandler:No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:That was Joey!
 Chandler:Yeah well she's probably talking to Richard.
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:Okay. (He gets up and goes to find her.)
 Chandler:(walking by with his luggage) See you later Mon.
 Chandler:What does it look like? I'm going home.
 Chandler:Come on! I was there! (He's propped up with his hand on a statute of a naked guy. He winces and pulls his hand away.) I know he's the love of your life.
 Chandler:Really?!
 Chandler:Yeah I wanted to make a dramatic scene but I hate packing.
 Chandler:(arm-in-arm with Monica) Hey Pheebs!
 Chandler:Yeah she couldn't live without the Chan Love. (They start kissing.)
 Chandler:Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
 Chandler:Okay ah umm ah a 8. Ah a 6?
 Chandler:8. 8!
 Chandler:If you get this one we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
 Chandler:Noo!
 Chandler:Ahh ooh try a hard 8.
 Chandler:Two fours.
 Chandler:Thank you Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay you get this and uh we get the biggest suite in the place! (Everyone cheers) Wait-wait-wait-wait! We (motions to Monica and him.) get the biggest suite in the place.
 Chandler:(sees the roll) Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
 Chandler:Another hard 8.
 Chandler:Okay okay I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; (pause) and we get married here tonight.
 Chandler:You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
 Chandler:Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
 Chandler:Okay so if an eight comes up we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
 Chandler:Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
 Chandler:(spots one) Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
 Chandler:All right!
 Chandler:Here it is! Here it is!
 Chandler:It's a four.
 Chandler:Okay all right all right all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay here's something here's something blue and new.
 Chandler:Let's go! (Starts to leave.)
 Chandler:Ohh great I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
 Chandler:I don't think so.
 Chandler:(looks around) Here just…take this. (Hands her the sweater.)
 Chandler:No we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
 Chandler:Okay one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)
 Chandler:Hello! One marriage please!
 Chandler:(singing) Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
 Chandler:Oh that's The Wedding March. Does does that freak you out?
 Chandler:Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get married!
 Chandler:Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get married!
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Yes! Well that-yes.
 Chandler:We actually missed it.
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:So has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
 Chandler:It’s a buffet man.
 Chandler:Listen I gotta talk to you.
 Chandler:Monica and I almost got married last night.
 Chandler:Look I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y’know? And how do I tell her without crushing her?
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:(returning with Joey) Hi.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…
 Chandler:(not quite sure) You did.
 Chandler:Well I think I think Ross already has one. Now this one’s free right? Because you paid for the first two so the third one’s free.
 Chandler:I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!
 Chandler:So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
 Chandler:Yes we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay so say uh say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.
 Chandler:Sounds great.
 Chandler:Ready!
 Chandler:(deadpan) Yes yes eight.
 Chandler:That was so unlikely. Well let’s get married! I guess.
 Chandler:That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight no wedding! Damnit!
 Chandler:Yeah. (They go pack.) We’re doing the right thing right?
 Chandler:Well you did pull his hair.
 Chandler:I’m not getting into this again!
 Chandler: Well I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay. (He opens the door carries her across the threshold stops backs out and lets go of Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:All right should we just should we just get married? Y’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
 Chandler:Me too!
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:Jeez relax! It’s not like we’re mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)
 Chandler:(entering slowly) Y’know I was thinking what if I uh unpack here?
 Chandler:Well what if all my stuff was here?
 Chandler:Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?
 Chandler:Me asking is kind of a sign.
 Chandler:Okay!!!!!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Oh thanks.
 Chandler:The door hasn’t been locked in five years but okay! (Runs out.) Ready?!
 Chandler:Okay a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can’t get in!
 Chandler:This is not a sign!
 Chandler:It’s an old key!
 Chandler:I love you!
 Chandler:Are you hugging the door right now.
 Chandler:Yeah-yeah me neither.
 Chandler:The key’s stuck in the lock.
 Chandler:(trying the handle) It still doesn’t work.
 Chandler:Oh.
 Chandler:Nice job Joe! You’re quite the craftsmen.
 Chandler:Y’know when we move in together can I get a gumball machine?
 Chandler:No. When it comes to sweets he’s surprisingly strict.
 Chandler:No no I keep trying y’know? I can get out Joey I have too… but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with …go to the bathroom. He may think I’m sick.
 Chandler:Oh so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?
 Chandler:All right.
 Chandler:No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey here’s the thing Monica and I have decided to live together here. So I’m gonna be moving out man.
 Chandler:Look I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:(looking down) What gave me away?
 Chandler:Okay so that’s it everybody knows! It’s official we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
 Chandler:Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Hey listen for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.
 Chandler:Well I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…
 Chandler:(To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)
 Chandler:Rach…
 Chandler:Okay when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
 Chandler:Well Joey’s my best friend.
 Chandler:You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
 Chandler:Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches for one.)
 Chandler:Hey-hey!
 Chandler:I am now!
 Chandler:Okay bye! (Exits.)
 Chandler:Look I’m just gonna be across the hall we can still do all the same stuff.
 Chandler:Not once did we do that.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Oh yeah? Well how’d she take it?
 Chandler:And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?
 Chandler:Okay I gotta ask who calls us that?!
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:Pheebs I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
 Chandler:Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!
 Chandler:Who was it?
 Chandler:Sure!
 Chandler:Well I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200 the real ones! The big-big ones!
 Chandler:Okay so you mean no as in Gee Chandler what an interesting idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely.
 Chandler:So that’s it?
 Chandler:Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!
 Chandler:I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
 Chandler:No I’m not mocking you (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful guest room. (Exits.)
 Chandler:Nothing Monica and I had a stupid fight.
 Chandler:(reading the ad) Wanted. Female roommate non-smoker non-ugly. Nice!
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:Hi listen I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get girls and now I can ‘em—Now I have you. (Monica glares at him.) Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way I see women…
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:Ohh.
 Chandler:That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
 Chandler:We don’t have to come up with this now.
 Chandler:Hey y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?
 Chandler:Yeah I mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. (Kisses her and heads into the living room.)
 Chandler:Is that a problem?
 Chandler:Oh that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.
 Chandler:Okay I get it. So I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes and head off to work!
 Chandler:In the game room!
 Chandler:All right! That’s fine! That’s fine! I won’t bring over the chairs! I won’t bring anything over! I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma’s place!! (Storms out.)
 Chandler:(entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potential roommate) Hi! I’ll be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.)
 Chandler:Why did you take the shower curtain down?
 Chandler:Well why don’t you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mocks him and he joins in.)
 Chandler:Well we are fond of the silliness but we also have a soft spot for the love.
 Chandler:That’s laughter.
 Chandler:I don’t know.
 Chandler:Yeah I do.
 Chandler:He’s being silly because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
 Chandler:Yeah I'm not so worried.
 Chandler:Of course!
 Chandler:Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Oh my God! Someone’s killed Square Man!
 Chandler:Oh that’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!
 Chandler:Y’know those big-big uh road signs that say Merge?
 Chandler:Y’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because that’s you and I together! Merge!
 Chandler:Really?!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Oh what’s the matter?
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?
 Chandler:Oh hi!
 Chandler:Why don’t you open with a joke?
 Chandler:Wait a minute hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!
 Chandler:That’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Yes you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild.
 Chandler:(opens and reads it) Benefits lapsed.
 Chandler:Okay it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because you didn’t work enough last year.
 Chandler:All right.
 Chandler:I’m sorry man there’s never a good time to (pauses) stop catching on fire.
 Chandler:Okay make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:That’s great but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?
 Chandler:What’s wrong with you?
 Chandler:This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!
 Chandler:That’s a hernia.
 Chandler:Hey will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.) Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
 Chandler:I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!
 Chandler:Listen I’m really glad you got the part.
 Chandler:But are you sure you can do this?
 Chandler:Now is that never talking about it again?!
 Chandler:I’m sorry! Hey-hey Joe why don’t you uh lift up your shirt? (He does.) Take a look at this kiddo. (Alex finally starts crying.) We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
 Chandler:What are you doing?
 Chandler:Oh all right.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Okay let me just jump in and ask at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
 Chandler:Ross just for my own piece of mind you’re not married to anymore of us are ya?
 Chandler:You left a shoe here?!
 Chandler:Oh good when he comes back for his keys I’ll be sure to give him your shoe.
 Chandler:(not enthused) Yeah all right.
 Chandler:Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
 Chandler:Yeah I’m gonna pass. ‘Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
 Chandler:Little baby girl Chandler where I have heard that before? Oh right Coach Ruben. (Tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly smells something. It’s times like these I’m glad Smell-O-Vision hasn’t been invented.) Do you know what Pheebs? When you’re done over there we kinda have a situation over here too. (Phoebe is changing hers.)
 Chandler:See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
 Chandler:I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around… (He degrades into baby talk but he means when they grab his finger.)
 Chandler:Okay I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
 Chandler:What equity investments?
 Chandler:You don’t even have a car!
 Chandler:And?
 Chandler:There you are.
 Chandler:(entering) Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up they can meet Krog! (He holds up this Xena-like warrior action figure.)
 Chandler:He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
 Chandler:They’re not gonna swallow anything you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
 Chandler:Glass sand whatever. (Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to check on the babies again.)
 Chandler:(entering) All right. (Clears throat) I thought about it and maybe you’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
 Chandler:I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
 Chandler:Well I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat. (Mimics a cat trying to cough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)
 Chandler:But you found the keys to his clothes?
 Chandler:That is true.
 Chandler:Ahh I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.
 Chandler:I think that’s gum.
 Chandler:Okay listen this really hurts. Let’s go.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:Well let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
 Chandler:And protected them from a tornado?
 Chandler:Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph.
 Chandler:Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
 Chandler:(pause) Phoebe would you take a look at this mess!!!!
 Chandler:(watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick so that he’s scratching his back with it.) Listen I’m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
 Chandler:First of the month.
 Chandler:No just the months you actually want to live here.
 Chandler:Okay here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)
 Chandler:That’s our phone number. Now look I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover you for a while?
 Chandler:It’s not charity Joe…
 Chandler:Okay uh here’s the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)
 Chandler:Uh yeah.
 Chandler:So we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?
 Chandler:No I hope not! I tried to offer him some money but he wouldn’t take it.
 Chandler:I figure that $1500 would cover him for a few months y’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.
 Chandler:Well that would help the pride thing.
 Chandler:Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
 Chandler:Okay! (They kiss) So what do you girls have planned for tonight?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Well instead of just hanging out we figure we’d do nothing.
 Chandler:Oh nope I-I have plans with Joey.
 Chandler:Yes but for the last time.
 Chandler:He’s at a dinner party.
 Chandler:Oh I wish I’d know you were going to do that I ordered Chinese.
 Chandler:Say Joe I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh foosball for money?
 Chandler:Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
 Chandler:Okay let’s play! The big game Italy vs. China apparently.
 Chandler:Okay give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death one goal $1000.
 Chandler:Oh yes!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:No! No! No! No—(Joey looks at him)—one can beat me.
 Chandler:See? Now that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
 Chandler:Still broken?
 Chandler:Well there are other ways of winning back your money how about a little uh a little Blackjack? (Holds up a deck of cards.)
 Chandler:Okay uh how about how about—y’know what? We could play a new game. A new game it’s fun.
 Chandler:Cups.
 Chandler:I’ll teach ya! Come on come on it’s really easy and really really fun.
 Chandler:Okay here you go. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens what do you have?
 Chandler:Ho-ho you win! 50 dollars!
 Chandler:Oh yeah! Okay let’s play again. (He deals out two cards each again.) What do you got?
 Chandler:You’re kidding right?
 Chandler:Well that’s a full cup! (Pays him again.)
 Chandler:You win.
 Chandler:It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay now much have you won so far?
 Chandler:Not 700 exactly?
 Chandler:Double it! (He does.)
 Chandler:Well you see in Cups once you get $700 you have to double it.
 Chandler:Hey I didn’t make up the rules. Now after you receive the doubling bonus you get uh one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1500. (Joey gets excited.) Don’t get to excited because that’s not gonna happen unless you get—No way! (He takes the top card which is the two of clubs. Of course any card would’ve won. Chandler pays him.)
 Chandler:What’s wrong?
 Chandler:Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
 Chandler:Oh man!!
 Chandler:All right let’s play one more hand! One more!
 Chandler:I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!
 Chandler:No but wait—what if I bought it from you y’know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price say (Gets choked up) $1500?
 Chandler:When did I try to give you money?
 Chandler:I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you’re okay.
 Chandler:(entering) Hey.
 Chandler:I know. (He kisses her.)
 Chandler:No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
 Chandler:Sure!
 Chandler:I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
 Chandler:Exactly.
 Chandler:It’s not a real game! I made it up!
 Chandler:At a fake game!!
 Chandler:Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
 Chandler:Hmm let’s see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cards and shrugs.)
 Chandler:(not amused) And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
 Chandler:I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
 Chandler:Yes and while I'm doing that Ross has a great computer story for you.
 Chandler:So uh wh-where ya from?
 Chandler:Unbelievable
 Chandler:Hey look at all the boxes!
 Chandler:All right think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
 Chandler:Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
 Chandler:No-no
 Chandler:OK I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. (Turns around and sees that Joey isn't there.) Joe? (Hears giggling coming from a box) Well I guess Joey went home. Oh and look there's still one box that I have to unpack. (Hears the giggling again)
 Chandler:(pretending) Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
 Chandler:Yeah not bad right? You know what Monica’s gonna be working late so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
 Chandler:Yeah now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
 Chandler:What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
 Chandler:Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
 Chandler:Yes I'm gonna put it back (Mocking Ross) exactly where I found it.
 Chandler:She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
 Chandler:She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and appreciate it.
 Chandler:I see I see y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
 Chandler:No she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. (Picks up the phone and wipes it off) Phone's done ehh.
 Chandler:Hey Mon how's it going?
 Chandler:Oh come on come on it can't be that bad.
 Chandler:No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
 Chandler:It's all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! (To Ross) She's-she's gonna kill me.
 Chandler:We should start with the big stuff. Y’know? That'll be the easiest. Uh let's start with the couch. (He picks up one end and Ross doesn't help) I got it. (He moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)
 Chandler:What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the...(Tries to rest his feet on the coffee table but they won't reach) OK OK here's what we do we just uh move the couch closer to the coffee table.
 Chandler:OK well here we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
 Chandler:Yes but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
 Chandler:Oh no yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
 Chandler:Yeah Monica doesn't like that either Maybe I should stop doing that.
 Chandler:That's not specific to girls.
 Chandler:And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
 Chandler:Man I'm so lucky I have Monica.
 Chandler:Okay is this lamp in the same place?
 Chandler:(blocks the door) No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
 Chandler:(to Ross) I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
 Chandler:Look uh just come later we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
 Chandler:Bye! Thank God
 Chandler:Look we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
 Chandler:That's perfect! That's brilliant! (Starts going through the photo album)
 Chandler:Uh-huh
 Chandler:No I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. (Forced laughter)
 Chandler:Okay look don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you so I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it where it went back and I'm sorry I'm very sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry.
 Chandler:Do you want me to be afraid of you?
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
 Chandler:Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
 Chandler:Hi my name’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
 Chandler:So is Janine around?
 Chandler:Can I check out what she did to my room?
 Chandler:(The room is filled with flowers and a floral print sheet on the bed.) Oh my God. What is th… it’s like a guy never lived in here. Look you’ve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. (Looking around the living room.) It’s spreading already.
 Chandler:(Picking up a pillow.) Yeah is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
 Chandler:(Pointing to the table and picking up the box.) Is that your tiny little box that’s too small to put anything in?
 Chandler:No! Ok this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
 Chandler:Yes talk to her. Be a man.
 Chandler:Defend yourself.
 Chandler:Be right there sweetums. (Monica leaves. To Joey.) A totally different situation.
 Chandler:Hey how was your breakfast with Hillary?
 Chandler:Ohh yeah.
 Chandler:That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either.
 Chandler:Yeah let’s head off to work.
 Chandler:You know…Oh My God.
 Chandler:(Sarcastically) Really.
 Chandler:Yeah what was wrong with your old…human teeth.
 Chandler:No no no no. You’ll be fine. (turning to Monica) Hillary’s bind right?
 Chandler:Yeah. (Rachel walks in.)
 Chandler:What???
 Chandler:I am proud of all my friends today.
 Chandler:Hi I’m Chandler. Your live-in boy
 Chandler:Oh I am no women but that is one tasty dish. (Phoebe walks in.)
 Chandler:Yes God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s.
 Chandler:Yes but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
 Chandler:Nah Nah it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know do kind of like a man thing.
 Chandler:You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
 Chandler:No thanks Josephine.
 Chandler:Hey Ross I was wondering if… Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
 Chandler:Monica could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
 Chandler:What is the matter with you ?!?
 Chandler:You’re arranging flowers! (Pointing to the dish on the table.) You got dead flowers! You got a picture a picture of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
 Chandler:You’re turning into a women.
 Chandler:Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?
 Chandler:Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
 Chandler:Oh! That’s great they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!
 Chandler:(shocked at the news) Why can’t I tell them that we live together?
 Chandler:Why haven’t you told them?!
 Chandler:Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!
 Chandler:Why wouldn’t they be happy?
 Chandler:What? What? Why?!
 Chandler:Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?
 Chandler:Y’know it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they come over I will be all charming I will make them fall in love with me and then we’ll tell ‘em.
 Chandler:Hey I can be pretty charming babe I won YOU over didn’t I?
 Chandler:Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh good Ross! You’re parents like me right?
 Chandler:Well Monica just told me that they don’t.
 Chandler:(annoyed) Do you know why?
 Chandler:(angry) Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!
 Chandler:This is great another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
 Chandler:Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
 Chandler:[mocks that last comment].
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Mr. and Mrs. Geller you look wonderful it is great to have you hear let us take off your coats!
 Chandler:Whoa snowing out there?
 Chandler:Yeah Ross sure is a great guy y’know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
 Chandler:(worried) He’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
 Chandler:Oh yes. Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I don’t mean tight I mean it’s not too tight not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope he puts his head into his hands.]
 Chandler:(shocked) What?
 Chandler:You do? Why?
 Chandler:What?! Why did you do that?
 Chandler:How could it not matter?!
 Chandler:What about all that “friends forever” stuff?
 Chandler:Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
 Chandler:The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me okay? So will you fix this?
 Chandler:Yeah I’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
 Chandler:(clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah this is so good that I’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
 Chandler:(lying) Yes but if it’s any consolation before the bird dropped it he seemed to enjoy it.
 Chandler:Thank you!
 Chandler:(In a parent-like tone) I’ll talk to them!
 Chandler:Let me ask you why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
 Chandler:I dunno what it is it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to me.
 Chandler:See now it feels like Christmas!
 Chandler:Hey Joe what’s up?
 Chandler:I can see why that’s hard to resist.
 Chandler:You are aware that she’s not a monkey right?
 Chandler:Ah you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you? (He kisses her on the cheek)
 Chandler:What what are you laughing at?
 Chandler:I don’t think so.
 Chandler:(To Rachel) Oh my God!
 Chandler:I can save you time ladies I’m right here.
 Chandler:What? That’s terrible!
 Chandler:Oh well that makes it not terrible.
 Chandler:No not okay you can’t look for Monica’s presents!
 Chandler:No you don’t have to and you can’t because I live here too.
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:No I have a great idea for a present for her.
 Chandler:If I help we can find ‘em faster!
 Chandler:Y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look you don’t you don’t do that every year do you?
 Chandler:You don’t like go into the back of my closet and look under my gym bag or anything?
 Chandler:Because that’s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I’ve never seen before in my life! Okay that did not just happen! (He does a weird clicky motion with his fingers that kinda hard to describe.)
 Chandler:I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey oh hey!
 Chandler:Those are my gifts I got them for you.
 Chandler:Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
 Chandler:Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet okay?
 Chandler:Oh hey guys!
 Chandler:Yes if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
 Chandler:Oh the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Oh great!
 Chandler:Okay! Okay! Okay!
 Chandler:Wait we can’t do this.
 Chandler:I don’t wanna know what Monica got me. Y’know? I mean look I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present and wanting to surprise me and you guys are gonna ruin that and I look we have to put these back this is not what Christmas is about.
 Chandler:Nobody is opening anything ok? Look I don’t know about you guys but I wanna see the look on Monica’s face when I give her my present and I’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please please can we just can we put them back?
 Chandler:Fine!
 Chandler:That’s what you got me?
 Chandler:Now you do that you’re on TV.
 Chandler:That’s great!
 Chandler:So you kissed her so what happened after that?
 Chandler:So she’s just waiting over there for ya?
 Chandler:(entering) Oh hey Rachel sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff. (Hands her all of her bills and stuff.)
 Chandler:I’m not your garbage man. I’m your mailman.
 Chandler:A pharmacist. (Rachel mocks him.)
 Chandler:You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
 Chandler:You made pottery?
 Chandler:Ahh just like the apothecary tables of yore…
 Chandler:…so then the farmer says That’s not a cow and you’re not milking it. (Everyone laughs.)
 Chandler:Look at us we’re a couple of couples!
 Chandler:Yeah all right. (They part.) Okay good night guys.
 Chandler:And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (Hands it to him.) You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn’t afford it because you paid dinner last night.
 Chandler:Oh that’s too bad.
 Chandler:That’s funny I saw no phlegm.
 Chandler:Then why-why is she going to a play?!
 Chandler:Well why does she not want to hang out with us?!
 Chandler:So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
 Chandler:And I am not blah I am a hoot!
 Chandler:No you sh—No you said you made that up!!
 Chandler:Eh they’re both good. I generally just go with Monica’s drunk again. (Monica glares at him.)
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Okay one more time.
 Chandler:Perfect decibel.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh nothing we’re just talking. Y’know blah-blah-blah.
 Chandler:That’s totally understandable.
 Chandler:Oh yeah!
 Chandler:And I’m blah? Listen the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it (Imitating her) Oh Chandler I just lost myself in the moment.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Y’know I think you can take her.
 Chandler:Did you hear that?
 Chandler:Yeah I’m sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?
 Chandler:Hey so did uh did she move out?
 Chandler:You okay?
 Chandler:That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
 Chandler:I made that joke up.
 Chandler:Yes I did. I told it to Dan at work and he said it was the funniest joke he’d ever heard.
 Chandler:Monica you remember me telling you that joke right?
 Chandler:Seriously?
 Chandler:Yeah I guess.
 Chandler:(jumping up from his chair) Hey Joey Playboy printed my joke.
 Chandler:It’s my joke.
 Chandler:Dude you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time and I think they may break up.
 Chandler:Nah Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on I don’t want to miss when they were skinny.
 Chandler:What? No I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and the screen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?
 Chandler:Joey why is your cable out?
 Chandler:If you need money will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
 Chandler:Whoa ho.
 Chandler:(picks up the phone) All right you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
 Chandler:(with phone to ear obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phone bill?
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:So you heard it you repeated it so that must mean you wrote it.
 Chandler:And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.
 Chandler:(stops laughing to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
 Chandler:So you stole my joke and you stole my money.
 Chandler:Well she is going to know that you stole the joke.
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:Okay (he goes to sit down).
 Chandler:(visibly upset) He took my joke he took it.
 Chandler:You know who else picked Rachel? Ross and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:Picking Rachel.
 Chandler:Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
 Chandler:So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.
 Chandler:I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to make a lot of money and here’s your first tip Don’t eat yellow snow. (He laughs then picks up a pen glares at Ross and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha 215 coffeehouse.
 Chandler:It’s my joke.
 Chandler:Let’s have Monica decide.
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:Mon get out here!
 Chandler:Okay okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
 Chandler:Because you’re the only one that can be fair.
 Chandler:(to Ross) Don’t try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) I’m your only chance to have a baby. Okay let’s go.
 Chandler:Okay I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
 Chandler:Can I finish my story?!
 Chandler:So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’s doctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his point.)
 Chandler:I’m not arguing with that.
 Chandler:Is not.
 Chandler:Hi oh hi.
 Chandler:(starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and—(He falters and Monica prompts him.)—generosity of spirit.
 Chandler:(To Chandler) I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
 Chandler:(pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) You’re a little high maintenance.
 Chandler:I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going but you’re passionate and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So they can say that you’re high maintenance but it’s okay because I like … maintaining you.
 Chandler:(happily) I’m off the list. (Sits on the couch.)
 Chandler:Hey buddy boy how’d the audition go?
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. I’m not answering that.
 Chandler:This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
 Chandler:Hey what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work?
 Chandler:I’m so sorry you’re sick.
 Chandler:I’m gonna grab you some tissue.
 Chandler:Yes?
 Chandler:Oh my God introduce us!
 Chandler:Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! (Rachel glares at him.)
 Chandler:I know let’s rest and drink lots of fluids. (Holds up a glass of orange juice.)
 Chandler:That would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippy here. (Points to his nose.)
 Chandler:Yeah I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy.
 Chandler:Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just can’t have sex with a sick person.
 Chandler:That’s the thing see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
 Chandler:Oh what is it honey you need some tea? Some soup? (He gets up from the couch and goes into the bedroom to find Monica still in the robe lying seductively on the bed. Or at least she’s trying too and as he enters the room she takes the robe off on of her legs.) Oh-ohhhh!
 Chandler:Oh Jeez honey I thought I thought you were asleep.
 Chandler:I was asleep. (She takes off her robe and starts to shiver) Oh no! No-no honey! Y’know what’s sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
 Chandler:Would you please get some rest!
 Chandler:Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
 Chandler:No-no-no-no-no-no-no you are not getting me this way.
 Chandler:No-no-no-no-no!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:So you’re just kinda rubbing it on yourself?
 Chandler:It’s nice.
 Chandler:Yes! (Hangs his head in shame.)
 Chandler:It’s all very very good. (She covers up and sits down.) So you wanna go uh mix it up?
 Chandler:Oh come on you big faker!
 Chandler:Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
 Chandler:Okay! (Runs into the bedroom.)
 Chandler:(calling from the bathroom) What are you doing here?
 Chandler:We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
 Chandler:He’s taking off her coat!
 Chandler:Ho-oh he’s gonna get some! (Rachel looks at him.) Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y’know so umm he’s closed the drapes there so he can have a nice pleasant conversation with your little sister. (Pause) Well I’m off to bed! (Goes to bed.)
 Chandler:I’m good.
 Chandler:(looking) Is that a swing?
 Chandler:Yuck!
 Chandler:That was like 5 years ago.
 Chandler:Joey…
 Chandler:(totally not crying) Well see now that I can see crying over but Bambi is a cartoon!
 Chandler:Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
 Chandler:I’m not macho.
 Chandler:No I guess I just never really cried. Y’know? I’m not a crying kind of guy.
 Chandler:I’d be sad sure but I wouldn’t cry.
 Chandler:Cry?! I just found a talking puppy I’m rich!
 Chandler:Oh that’s Parent’s Day first grade. That’s me with the janitor Martin.
 Chandler:Oh they didn’t want to come!
 Chandler:No! Look I don’t cry! It’s not a big deal! Okay?!
 Chandler:You didn’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
 Chandler:Phoebe Buffay in Buffay The Vampire Layer.
 Chandler:Hey I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do porn.
 Chandler:Her ankle is what you’re watching?
 Chandler:She’s just doing her job!
 Chandler:Hey! (He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the couch only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)
 Chandler:There’s no back to this couch!
 Chandler:Yeah I know but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know all dead inside.
 Chandler:Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
 Chandler:No I mean come on seriously think about it we get married we’re up at the altar and I’m like this. (Makes a bored face.)
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:Okay well I won’t uh worry about this anymore then.
 Chandler:Aww I love you so…
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:So you didn’t mean any of that?!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Maybe we should give them some privacy.
 Chandler:(crying hysterically) I just don’t see why those two can’t work things out!
 Chandler:(starts crying) I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone. (They all look at him.) I can’t help it I opened a gate.
 Chandler:Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
 Chandler:Sure I would!
 Chandler:What you guys really think that I’m that shallow?
 Chandler:What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker getting paid to be funny. But my job’s fun too! I mean tomorrow I-I don’t have to wear a tie.
 Chandler:(entering depressed) Hey.
 Chandler:Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny just not Archie Comic funny.
 Chandler:Was his question what’s more boring than him?
 Chandler:Hey I may have no money but I still have my pride.
 Chandler:Ehh.
 Chandler:I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:All right!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Well it’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he’s not real.
 Chandler:Uh-oh it’s my boss!
 Chandler:(reading the list) Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
 Chandler:Phoebe are you having a heart attack?!
 Chandler:I always thought having a heart attack was nature’s way of telling you to die! (Phoebe glares at him.) But you’re not gonna die. I mean you are going to die but you’re not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
 Chandler:Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is Bring me food. Two is I’m with a girl bring us food. Three is I’m lost and I can’t find food.
 Chandler:(approaching) Here you go Joe here’s the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. (Hands it to him.)
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:I’m sorry I guess I just like the pulp.
 Chandler:Okay anything for you sir?
 Chandler:It’s not all juice! (Rachel quickly gets out of the way.)
 Chandler:Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
 Chandler:Aww.
 Chandler:You wanna share it?
 Chandler:What’s this?
 Chandler:Aww thanks man. (They hug.)
 Chandler:Oh you wouldn’t uh care. It’s just a stupid comic book story.
 Chandler:Well uh Archie needs money to fix his jalopy (Joey laughs) uh but he doesn’t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist—as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can’t have lumps in them.
 Chandler:No the doctors say it may kill her.
 Chandler:(To Ross) But I think we should tell her.
 Chandler:Listen Phoebe he’s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
 Chandler:Uh what about y’know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
 Chandler:I’m sorry you’re here with me instead of Roger.
 Chandler:Well I could make it seem like he’s here. (Imitates him.) Here’s some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn’t add the second cous until 1979. (Mumbles something further.)
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:What was tonight?
 Chandler:Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?
 Chandler:With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monica shrugs.) Oh my God!
 Chandler:Four different women! I’ve had sex way more times!
 Chandler:Nine.
 Chandler:Well good good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
 Chandler:Hey that’s what I tell girls about me.
 Chandler:No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
 Chandler:Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)
 Chandler:So was I.
 Chandler:We can’t do this.
 Chandler:Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me y’know? Because you’ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldn’t want to disappoint you.
 Chandler:I do like that.
 Chandler:Well if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight right?
 Chandler:Stop it! We’re doing this! Let’s do it!
 Chandler:Okay! (They both get up.)
 Chandler:I have some moves.
 Chandler:Yeah let’s just forget it.
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Oh yeah.
 Chandler:(sexily) Yeah?
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Oh okay! (He rolls over to do that again.)
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
 Chandler:So you uh want to do something tonight?
 Chandler:Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you’re still seeing him and uh he’s a good guy. I mean I remember a time when… (He fakes falling asleep.)
 Chandler:Yeah! Totally! Totally and you?
 Chandler:I bet he can.
 Chandler:Oh yeah! Yeah! Don’t worry about me I’ll be fine! (Does a kara-tay move.)
 Chandler:(sticking his head in the door) Okay to come in?
 Chandler:Yeah I know guess who beeped him?
 Chandler:I’m the ruptured spleen. (Laughs.)
 Chandler:Because you shouldn’t be with him. (Pause.) You should be with me.
 Chandler:Yeah! When you were talking about Roger that was killing me! Look things like last night they don’t just happen. Y’know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women in the morning y’know I was just lying there and I couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends but with you I always y’know with a friend.
 Chandler:I know you probably don’t want to go out with me y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a doctor…
 Chandler:No there were two.
 Chandler:Oh yeah.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
 Chandler:I see where you’re goin’!
 Chandler:(reminiscing) Ah finally an explanation.
 Chandler:Hey-hey is Monica here?
 Chandler:Okay look I need your help I don’t know what to get her for Valentine’s Day.
 Chandler:(laughs) She was working on Valentine’s Day so we’re celebrating it tonight.
 Chandler:Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and her brother (the camera pans to Ross flashing Joey a very evil look; Joey gets scared) I can’t do that we promised we’d make each other gifts this year.
 Chandler:Yeah I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
 Chandler:I made a… (Does one of those gibberish words.)
 Chandler:Nothing!
 Chandler:Well have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
 Chandler:(admiring his work) This this actually is a… (Does the same gibberish word from before.)
 Chandler:Hey! Honey can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Day gifts?
 Chandler:Do we have to make the entire thing?
 Chandler:Of course of course not. I just have to uh go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
 Chandler:(sticking his head back in) What?
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:Okay are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?
 Chandler:I can’t figure out what to make Monica.
 Chandler:I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
 Chandler:Yeah I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
 Chandler:Wait a minute I can’t give this to her.
 Chandler:Because it says Captain Ross on the side and I hate Monica on the bottom.
 Chandler:Okay. Okay. (He goes to the closet moves the clothes out of the way and notices an empty hanger. He takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. Then he holds it out as if he’s giving it to her.) Yes honey I made it myself. (He throws it down and goes to her chest grabs something goes to the bed table and takes out a pair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he just removed.) I can’t do it. I can’t do it. (He throws them both down and continues looking. He opens another closet door and finds a tape.) Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!! (He runs out into the living room.)
 Chandler:Hey! Hi! You uh ready to exchange gifts?
 Chandler:Okay come here! Come here.
 Chandler:Now it’s not wrapped because I just just finished it.
 Chandler:But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
 Chandler:(momentarily terrified) Maybe we’ll have to listen and see!
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:It’s a sock bunny.
 Chandler:Not really.
 Chandler:I see. Y’know umm Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
 Chandler:Oh it’s okay. I don’t…
 Chandler:(thinking it over) Well I did put a lot of thought in the tape. (They both run into the bedroom.)
 Chandler:Wow! (To the sock bunny still on his hand.) You are way to young to have seen that!
 Chandler:You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
 Chandler:Yeah! (Takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.)
 Chandler:You have done enough!
 Chandler:No you don’t—get it in black not brown.
 Chandler:Oop!
 Chandler:Well it’s like that old saying have some sex eat some cake.
 Chandler:Who the hell is Carl?!
 Chandler:Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you aren’t they?
 Chandler:Oh my good God.
 Chandler:Look you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
 Chandler:Oh the mixed tape.
 Chandler:No! You’re the sweetest! (He tries to kiss her but Monica backs away with a look that could kill on her face.)
 Chandler:I am so so so so sorry!
 Chandler:And I will cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen) and do anything in there! (Points to the bedroom.)
 Chandler:Come on Monica it’s our Valentine’s Day. Please? Please-please please?
 Chandler:Okay. (They hug.)
 Chandler:So are we going in there?
 Chandler:Ahh Hotties of the Paleontology Department there’s a big selling calendar eh?
 Chandler:A hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s Rain Man.
 Chandler:Oh is that against the rules?
 Chandler:I see.
 Chandler:Oh yeah Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
 Chandler:Oh I don’t know man. I haven’t talked to her in like ten years.
 Chandler:You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand four hundred…
 Chandler:Oh okay I’ll-I’ll try.
 Chandler:Yeah so Tuesday?
 Chandler:(sarcastically) Thank you.
 Chandler:You just thought of that in there?
 Chandler:What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
 Chandler:How’s your room Rach?
 Chandler:Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
 Chandler:God it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how long it’s been!
 Chandler:(on phone) Oh that’s great! Good for you.
 Chandler:Okay! So yeah maybe we can get together umm… (Joey mimes throwing something in the air catching it rolling it out putting it in an oven and cutting it.) Can you hold for one second please? (To Joey) What?!
 Chandler:(on phone) Hi! I’m back. (Goes to hang up the phone.) Yeah that sounds great. (Listens) Okay. Well we’ll do it then. (Listens) Okay bye-bye. (He hangs up the phone and turns around to see Joey standing close to him and screams.)
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:(To Joey) We didn’t get to the audition. I’m gonna take her to coffee and then we’ll do it then.
 Chandler:Honey it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years! You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules y’know? You gotta you got to put in some time.
 Chandler:No we only went out once.
 Chandler:Not once!
 Chandler:(laughs) Oh that’s great my friend Joey’s in the movie business.
 Chandler:(giggles) My friend’s name is Joey.
 Chandler:Yeah I’ve always hated that Howie.
 Chandler:The nerve huh?
 Chandler:Refill?
 Chandler:(entering) Hey.
 Chandler:I couldn’t do it.
 Chandler:Hey relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight.
 Chandler:Uh Dana Keystone from college.
 Chandler:No that was Dana Caplin.
 Chandler:Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no that’s not—No-no-no!
 Chandler:No-no—Really?!
 Chandler:(breaking up) Well it just hurts so bad. I uh…
 Chandler:Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
 Chandler:Well I umm I mean this is just off the top of my head now umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
 Chandler:Well the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later. (He runs off and leaves her with the bill which the waiter promptly delivers.)
 Chandler:(entering sees Rachel’s throw) Ni-hi-ice!
 Chandler:(To Joey) So you busy Thursday?
 Chandler:Okay. Okay. (Joey puts him down.) What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:No! No! No! I was so careful! (Runs out.)
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:So?!
 Chandler:It’s Thursday! How was the audition?!
 Chandler:Well of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. (Pats Joey’s arm Joey pats Chandler’s shoulder and Chandler motions for Joey to say the same about him.)
 Chandler:So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
 Chandler:(laughs) Isn’t she cute? (On Monica’s death stare) No!
 Chandler:So why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
 Chandler:Oh tell her good luck with that.
 Chandler:Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
 Chandler:Oh that’s so funny because we found someone too.
 Chandler:Why would our guy be a weirdo?
 Chandler:A face ass?
 Chandler:No our guy is just a floating head.
 Chandler:(horrified) Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
 Chandler:Our guy has great hair.
 Chandler:Our guy smells incredible.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Well you…don’t look good Joe.
 Chandler:That’s still in there?!
 Chandler:Is this a service you’re providing me?
 Chandler:Our new fridge? I don’t live here anymore.
 Chandler:Uh-huh.
 Chandler:(not quite sure where Joey’s going and is a little worried) Okay…
 Chandler:Just tell her the truth! Tell her you’re not ready.
 Chandler:Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
 Chandler:Joey I saw you push him!
 Chandler:Uh-huh.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Wait a minute is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? (Does a little whooping/party noise.)
 Chandler:I can see it now Look dad it’s the Sphinx! (Does that party noise again.)
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
 Chandler:Are you funny?
 Chandler:(To Monica) Turns out he is kinda funny.
 Chandler:Yeah but Sebastian? What is that? A cat’s name?
 Chandler:Okay so you will meet our guys?
 Chandler:Okay now it doesn’t matter which one you choose y’know? It’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
 Chandler:(To Ross) Well there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
 Chandler:You know the hotels?
 Chandler:Well maybe you don’t marry this one.
 Chandler:Good-good-good-good.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good but uh y’know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (Laughs) Eldad come here! (He stands up from the next table.)
 Chandler:Eldad sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now!
 Chandler:There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler)
 Chandler:Hi. (To Phoebe) Okay you’re too late okay? Because she’s already with our guy.
 Chandler:It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.)
 Chandler:(To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To Eldad) You dance for Rachel!
 Chandler:So what was it for anyway?
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:(To Joey) So uh what’s this thing you’re auditioning for?
 Chandler:That is lucky.
 Chandler:Now-now why would you say that Joseph?
 Chandler: Whoa she's pretty. (Mentioning the girl on TV)
 Chandler: Oh ok.
 Chandler:Oh no it's terrific it's- it's- y'know you deserve this after all your years of struggling you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.
 Chandler:Oh are we playing this?!
 Chandler:Hey! How’d the audition go?
 Chandler:So it did go well.
 Chandler:Oh that’s great!
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Oh-oh what are you doing?
 Chandler:Well it is overdue.
 Chandler:(on phone) Yes Fran. I know what time it is but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
 Chandler:Oh come on guys it’s not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren’t for (struggles to get this out) Monica’s allergies. (The duck quacks.) You’re right I could never lie to you. She hates you. (The phone rings.) Should I get that? (Laughs then answers the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Uh no Joey’s not here right now. Can I take a message? (Listens) Yeah okay so the audition has been moved from 500 to 230? (Listens) Okay great. (Listens.) Bye. (Hangs up the phone and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle on the door but Monica walks in and forces him to jump out of the way.)
 Chandler:(looks down at his clothes) Am I naked again?!
 Chandler:Yeah okay I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean is it okay if they come visit?
 Chandler:Oh right your allergies. (Monica leaves and to the chick and duck) All her she hates you. (Chandler leaves without finishing the message for Joey.)
 Chandler:As crazy as soccer?
 Chandler:You mean you didn’t get it from this?
 Chandler:Well maybe we can fix it y’know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
 Chandler:I messed up. Okay? I’m sorry I really messed up.
 Chandler:Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look if there was anything I could do I would do it. Okay? But everybody’s allowed one mistake right?
 Chandler: You know he coulda gotten me a VCR he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs but no he has to get me the woman repeller!  The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
 Chandler: Oh yeah easy for you to say you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]
 Chandler: I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry I do I do. I pity the fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi!
 Chandler: Yeah I mean when you were late last night Kathy and I got to talking and one thing to another and…
 Chandler: No! No! No! I just kissed her.
 Chandler: How is that worse?!
 Chandler: You’re right I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
 Chandler:Look I’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you’re not perfect! You’ve made some errors in judgment too!
 Chandler:(lets him out) What happened?!!
 Chandler: What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
 Chandler: So--You got in voluntarily?!
 Chandler: BEND OVER?!!!
 Chandler:Ok now remember no trading. You get the pretty one I get the mess.
 Chandler:...And what did you bring?
 Chandler:Janice?
 Chandler:Janice?!
 Chandler:Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
 Chandler:Oh come on!  He said he was going to do my inseam and he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite...
 Chandler:Cupping.
 Chandler:I can’t believe I did this! What an idiot!
 Chandler:Do you think he’ll ever forgive me?
 Chandler:Y’know what? I-I kinda have.
 Chandler:You didn’t see how mad he was y’know?
 Chandler:(coming out from behind the door) I KNEW IT!!!!
 Chandler:Oh my God! 
 Chandler:Joey? Got you a Joey Special two pizzas! Joe? (The phone rings and he answers it) (On phone) Hello? (Takes the phone away from his mouth when he realizes what he just did and yells.) Damnit! (Back on phone.) Hello? (Listens.) No Joey’s not here right now but I can take a message I think. (Listens) He’s still got a chance for the part?! Oh that’s great news! (Listens) Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. (Listens) Oh well that’s great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! (Hangs up and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle.) Yes! (Reading what he’s writing) Okay Mac audition at 200. Allergy actor attacked. (Pause) By dog not flowers.
 Chandler:Please tell me you got the message!
 Chandler:The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it they needed to see you at 2 o’clock.
 Chandler:Du-du-I wrote it I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross’s! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
 Chandler:Sorry! I-I-I don’t know what to say.
 Chandler:(angrily) Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
 Chandler:Y’know sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
 Chandler:Well that’s good. Because you didn’t! And I’m incredibly happy for ya!!
 Chandler:Oh we could do this all day.
 Chandler:You are gonna be a huge star! I’m gonna hug ya!
 Chandler:All right!
 Chandler:I think so. Yeah get off me.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Oh well thank you in advance. (Kisses her.)
 Chandler:Hey!!
 Chandler:Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
 Chandler:Are you judging them by their covers? Because you’re really not supposed to do that.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Wait a minute hold the phone! You’re not Elizabeth’s dad?!
 Chandler:Ross!
 Chandler:There’s a Mr. Bing!
 Chandler:But uh Ross Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh funny story… (He starts laughing then notices that Paul isn’t happy.) You’re roommate in college died didn’t he?
 Chandler:Yes we were just…
 Chandler:Hey honey you got the kind with the little girl you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
 Chandler:No the little girl creeps me out.
 Chandler:Why would the baby creep me out?
 Chandler:This is going in your book?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Damn those robots they’re supposed to be our faithful servants!
 Chandler:So do you think uh Joey’s more charming than me?
 Chandler:Yeah you wish. (Stops to think about it and gets depressed.)
 Chandler:Who?
 Chandler:Hmm.
 Chandler:Oh.
 Chandler:Oh-oh.
 Chandler:We said seven!
 Chandler:The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s let meet at seven not at six.
 Chandler:Oh my good God.
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:(disgusted) What does it say?!
 Chandler:Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh great book and you are the queen of everything.
 Chandler:(To Monica) I told you I should not wear this color. (He’s wearing a reddish-orange sweater.)
 Chandler:So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
 Chandler:Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
 Chandler:Hi how are ya?
 Chandler:(whispering in Joey’s ear) The reason he just said.
 Chandler:Yeah I’ve been there my friend.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:I’ll give up my ticket.
 Chandler:And I think Ross is generous too.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Ross.
 Chandler:(on machine) You’ve reached Monica and Chandler’s if you’re listening to this message we’re probably screening. (to himself) Yeah we are.
 Chandler:(on phone) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (Listens) Yes the groom—No! Not the groom!!
 Chandler:(gets up) See you later. (Starts to leave.)
 Chandler:(angrily) Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! (He storms out.)
 Chandler:(on machine) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (The machine beeps off.)
 Chandler:I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married but that happens everyday. (Does one of those Chandler noises.)
 Chandler:Right here! (Clucks like a chicken for some reason.)
 Chandler:Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you Phoebe and Rachel Heldi and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Yes if it really doesn’t mean anything because you know that I’m just not ready…
 Chandler:Okay. (They hug.)
 Chandler:Totally.
 Chandler:Yeah it’s beautiful.
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:Pheebs can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page) Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah! Paper cut!
 Chandler:No I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.
 Chandler:Well it’s because I trust you you’re one of my best friends and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
 Chandler:Me too.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh all right.
 Chandler:Oh well we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place.
 Chandler:Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too and I can’t find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and starts pointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Notices that one of the jewelers is watching him.) It’s a beautiful selection. (The jeweler walks away slowly.)
 Chandler:Y’know I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.
 Chandler:Yeah I’m gonna stick with the ring. (Goes to another display counter.) Oh this one’s nice! (Pointing to another ring.) I like this one! Sir? Uh kind sir? Can I see this one?
 Chandler:Uh-uh yes. I would like to see that ring please.
 Chandler:Sir can I ask you to umm could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
 Chandler:(choking up) Oh my God that’s it that’s the ring! How much is it?
 Chandler:Yes! Yes but I can only pay $8000.
 Chandler:Uh credit card. (Reaches for it then realizes) Oh no! No-no but I left my credit card with Joey. (To Phoebe) Okay I’ll go get it. You guard the ring.
 Chandler:No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.)
 Chandler:No did he hug you?!
 Chandler:Well you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:I’m a little busy here Paul.
 Chandler:Okay a quick one. Come on hug it out. (Paul rushes over and hugs Chandler tightly.) Oh hey! There you go. (The hug continues.) Okay. (The hug continues.)
 Chandler:Okay! (Pushes him away.)
 Chandler:Do you have my credit card?
 Chandler:Thank God! (Grabs his card.)
 Chandler:Oh I can’t go.
 Chandler:Oh that’s uh that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with the one I picked first.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:They put you in jail?
 Chandler:Phoebe I asked you to guard the ring!
 Chandler:Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
 Chandler:It was the ring!
 Chandler:I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
 Chandler:No it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica’s face when I gave it to her y’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look this is the most important thing I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect.
 Chandler:I can’t do that.
 Chandler:Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
 Chandler:Yeah! Okay go go go get him.
 Chandler:(to him) Hi! Hi. Okay there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So I’m gonna need to have that back. (The guy isn’t sure.) But in exchange I’m willing to trade you this beautiful more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.) Ew.
 Chandler:No-no! This is my fiancee (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring. You don’t want to break her heart now do you?
 Chandler:Yeah she’s dying… Of a cough apparently.
 Chandler:(interrupting her) Okay that’s enough honey!
 Chandler:Great! Okay here. (Holds the ring up for him.)
 Chandler:Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And you are about to marry a wonderful man! (She stunned and he’s horrified.) Hey! I’m marrying a dead woman!
 Chandler:Guys? (They ignore him.) I’ve got something important to tell ya. (Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to try and watch the TV Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.
 Chandler:Yeah check out the ring. (Shows it to them.)
 Chandler:Yep pretty much.
 Chandler:(goes to hug him and stops short) Heyyyy—What?
 Chandler:Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait ‘til uh it was official y’know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you’re my best friends.
 Chandler:I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:Check out the ring.
 Chandler:Well she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that right? (Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the game on TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)
 Chandler:Okay well tonight’s the big night.
 Chandler:It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full instead of proposing a toast I’m just gonna propose.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:I’m not gonna mess it up.
 Chandler:She’s not gonna say no.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:(To Phoebe) Give me it!
 Chandler:Phoebe!
 Chandler:(with his mouthful) Hi Monica.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:(glaring at her) Well Monica and Chandler can’t go. We’re going to dinner remember?!
 Chandler:I just get mad when Rachel doesn’t remember where we’re going.
 Chandler:Well you could also give back the money you owe me.
 Chandler:Oh so you’re already doing your part for the kids.
 Chandler:Wait a minute all jokes aside? I didn’t agree to that!
 Chandler:Will you marry me? Will you marry me? (Makes like a gun with his fingers.) Hey you marry me! (He gives up as Joey Rachel Phoebe and Ross slink in all excited.) What’s going on little elves?
 Chandler:Yeah right here in my pocket. (Pats his pocket. Phoebe smiles goes over to hug him and removes the ring from his pocket.) Pheebs?
 Chandler:Okay now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she’s gonna know.
 Chandler:(To Monica) You are beautiful.
 Chandler:(trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (It’s a butchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreign friends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.)
 Chandler:Yes! Yes! I’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!
 Chandler:Oh yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh no you can’t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold you should’ve brought your own jacket. But uh other than that are you okay? Are you okay?
 Chandler:Yes! I’m fine. In fact I’ve been fine for a long time now and I think the reason is you.
 Chandler:Okay umm before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn’t imagine growing old with…
 Chandler:(not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know but just let me say it.
 Chandler:What?! I’m Chandler! (She nods towards the doorway Chandler turns and looks) Oh that’s Richard!
 Chandler:Hey-hey hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I don’t know why I did that!
 Chandler:(to Richard’s date) And uh you don’t have a mustache which is good. (She just smiles.) I’m Chandler; I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable.
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles at him.) See I did it again.
 Chandler:Yeah I’ll sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)
 Chandler:Yes. (Thinking he’s gone.)
 Chandler:I got a good one I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:(stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
 Chandler:Richard!
 Chandler:Oh you knew that. Good!
 Chandler:For camp!
 Chandler:Hey you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you’re not careful you may not get married at all this year!
 Chandler:(after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!
 Chandler:Richard was there so I couldn’t do it!
 Chandler:I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know and-and surprise her but now you’ve ruined it!
 Chandler:Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!
 Chandler:This is terrible. What am I going to do?
 Chandler:That’s right I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
 Chandler:I can do that I’ve had 30 years of practice.
 Chandler:Okay okay here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Oh just hanging out talkin’ about uh websites. (Joey laughs.) Yeah we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
 Chandler:Yeah well… Y’know it just got me thinking though why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
 Chandler:Eh…
 Chandler:Sure I do. In fact I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!
 Chandler:If marriage worked I’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
 Chandler:Well never say never but y’know probably uh yeah never.
 Chandler:Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!
 Chandler:(to them) It’s okay I got a plan.
 Chandler:I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:My—Oh my God!
 Chandler:He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’m supposed to do that!
 Chandler:Well what… Y’know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna go over there; I’m gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!
 Chandler:You’re right.
 Chandler:Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) I’m gonna get the ring! I’m gonna get the ring! (Does so) I’m gonna go find her and (starts running for the door) I’m just going to propose!
 Chandler:Okay great.
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:Where is she? I’m not scared of you! (Averts his eyes and walks in.)
 Chandler:(examining the coffee table) Scotch on the rocks with a twist on a coaster? Ha-ha Monica! Monica!
 Chandler:Well where did she go?
 Chandler:Oh my God I can’t believe this! Y’know I thought…I thought you were a good guy.
 Chandler:Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?
 Chandler:Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
 Chandler:And what does she have to think about? I love her!
 Chandler:But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things she’d be surprised!
 Chandler:It was working until you showed up you big tree! I mean this isn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! (Sits down heavily.) I was gonna propose tonight.
 Chandler:Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Did you get a ring?
 Chandler:Y’know Richard…you are a good guy.
 Chandler:I can’t talk to you now I gotta find Monica!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:What are you talking about?
 Chandler:Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her it was a plan?!
 Chandler:Well where… Where did she go?
 Chandler:I can’t believe I ruined this.
 Chandler:Oh my God.
 Chandler:Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! Oh God I thought… (Starting to cry pauses) Wait a minute I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you’ll let me I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica will you marry me?
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Monica and I are engaged.
 Chandler:Thanks.
 Chandler:(To Ross) Okay you get her in here. (To Joey) You bolt the door. I’ll be in the closet.
 Chandler:It’s okay I want this to be your night too. (Raises his class.) To Monica.
 Chandler:To Monica!
 Chandler:So when you said Get up early did you mean 1986?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Know what I mean?
 Chandler:There’s gonna be a wedding. You’re gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
 Chandler:(motioning with his hands) I’m not worried I’m uh I’m fascinated. Y’know it’s like uh Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her room with her guitar.)
 Chandler:Sure you guys don’t have this problem you’re made of wood. (Rachel comes out of the bathroom) Hey!
 Chandler:You look great!
 Chandler:You okay over there?
 Chandler:Oh don’t worry about it I mean you probably were tired you had a lot of champagne it happens to everybody.
 Chandler:(putting his hands up) Take whatever you want just please don’t hurt me.
 Chandler:Yes on a scale from 1 to 10 10 being the dumbest a person can look you are definitely 19.
 Chandler:Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody’s ready and please oh please keep my underwear!
 Chandler:Joe?
 Chandler:Uhh you’ve had a lot of sex right?
 Chandler:Well it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kind of eh uh I was unable to—I mean I really wanted too but I couldn’t…. There huh—hmm there-there was an incident.
 Chandler:It’s happened to you?
 Chandler:Well what’d you do?
 Chandler:(angrily) I don’t think that’s what they were talking about Joe!!
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:Yes you can pass for 19.
 Chandler:Yes!
 Chandler:Seriously? Seriously no! You can play your own age which is 31!
 Chandler:Now Monica I know you’re upset but don’t forget. There is going to be a wedding you are going to throw the bouquet and then there’s going to be a honeymoon maybe in Paris.
 Chandler:We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).
 Chandler:Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it’s romantic but because I can!
 Chandler:Okay don’t say anything you might scare it away.
 Chandler:It’s Paris who knows we’re here!
 Chandler:Pheebs we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
 Chandler:Oh give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!
 Chandler:What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay bye-bye!
 Chandler:(entering) Ahh third base.
 Chandler:(To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.
 Chandler:Well somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)
 Chandler:How is that ever going to happen?!
 Chandler:(To Ross) I don’t care she slept with me.
 Chandler:Thanks.
 Chandler:(interrupting her just in time) Hey! Here’s a dollar consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
 Chandler:Okay. (Goes back to bed.)
 Chandler:What’s the matter honey?
 Chandler:(incredulous) Already?!
 Chandler:Oh I got some thoughts on that.
 Chandler:What in God’s name is that?!
 Chandler:Well you couldn’t get them anyway. Ian doesn’t plan anymore and Derrick… (Off of Rachel and Monica’s looks) And Derrick is a name I shouldn’t know.
 Chandler:Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
 Chandler:Now do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Centerpieces!
 Chandler:Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well I just think they’re a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.) But Lilies are the clear choice.
 Chandler:Uh-huh!
 Chandler:Oh yeah I should probably call them.
 Chandler:Oh I don’t think I ever heard that story.
 Chandler:What a sweet story.
 Chandler:Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. (Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)
 Chandler:I don’t know my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to (Pause) Dollywood.
 Chandler:Honey it’s gonna be okay.
 Chandler:Look it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we’re gonna get married.
 Chandler:Well I have some.
 Chandler:Well close to… (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to write it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.)
 Chandler:Well you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
 Chandler:Well come on I’ve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future not just for a party.
 Chandler:No I realize that honey but I’m not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
 Chandler:Look I understand but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
 Chandler:Yes I am!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Ehh.
 Chandler:Look I thought about it too and I’m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
 Chandler:Yeah I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then then that’s what we’re gonna do.
 Chandler:Eh forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Uh four a boy twin girls and another boy.
 Chandler:Well stuff like where’d we live y’know? Like a small place outside the city where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course we’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
 Chandler:Sure you do.
 Chandler:You sure?
 Chandler:I love you so much.
 Chandler:Oh yeah totally!
 Chandler:Hey you guys!
 Chandler:So what do you think?
 Chandler:Are you kidding? Okay I’ll give you a hint; I’ll give you a hint. (Points to his glasses.)
 Chandler:I got glasses!
 Chandler:No I didn’t!
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:(sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didn’t think I used to wear glasses right?
 Chandler:That’s okay Pheebs we’re not having a party or anything so you don’t have to get us…
 Chandler:What we want honey.
 Chandler:Dying people say the craziest things.
 Chandler:Our kids are gonna be fat aren’t they.
 Chandler:Hey! How’s the boat?!
 Chandler:Well it’s good that you finally have a place to do that.
 Chandler:Do you know what I was thinkin’?
 Chandler:Nothing I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)
 Chandler:Uh why do you have a lecture?
 Chandler:Then free as a bird. What’s up?
 Chandler:Well did-did you correct him?
 Chandler:Oh no problem maybe I’ll play with my left hand.
 Chandler:Does anybody know me?!
 Chandler:Don’t worry about it Pheebs.
 Chandler:An old cookie?
 Chandler:We can’t accept this.
 Chandler:‘Cause it’s gross.
 Chandler:Okay we owe you a present.
 Chandler:I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
 Chandler:Daddy. All right look here’s the story. (Flashback to Chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way around the steam filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses and that’s when in happened.
 Chandler:Guys?
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:Why do they put so much steam in there?!
 Chandler:Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
 Chandler:Not that big a deal? There…there was touching of things.
 Chandler:I don’t want him to tell this story for years.
 Chandler:If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
 Chandler:(getting up) All right I’m off to see your dad.
 Chandler:Look I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore and I figure the best way to do that is face to face—And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face I don’t mean my ass. (Exits.)
 Chandler:So you understand I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know I’m a little…I’m a little embarrassed about it.
 Chandler:What did you do when they found out?
 Chandler:So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
 Chandler:It’s your mommy. It’s your mommy.
 Chandler:That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
 Chandler:And say nothing?
 Chandler:No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)
 Chandler:Hi sweetie. So what was with all the whispering?
 Chandler:Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
 Chandler:No I’m serious we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
 Chandler:Oh no-no I can’t do that.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:So Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant I mean a guy a hibachi and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway we’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
 Chandler:No he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs hysterically.) So what was Phoebe’s secret?
 Chandler:That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
 Chandler:(angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
 Chandler:What about him?
 Chandler:Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow! Don’t show this to Monica! And don’t tell her about the W-H-Wow!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh it’s always nicer to here than Aw crap! You again!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh yeah?
 Chandler:Did you not understand the story?
 Chandler:Hey! What’s up?
 Chandler:Huh.
 Chandler:No! (The oven dings.) Shhh!
 Chandler:Nancy Thompson’s getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the shoulder.)
 Chandler:I had too okay?! We’re getting married! Married couples can’t keep secrets from one another!
 Chandler:Du-ude!
 Chandler:Did you not hear me say Du-ude?!
 Chandler:In my defense it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
 Chandler:Ho-ho so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
 Chandler:You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college Ross used to wear leg warmers!
 Chandler:Ross came in forth and cried!
 Chandler:(To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross) Wow—whoa!
 Chandler:Hey!!!
 Chandler:That was you!
 Chandler:(To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right?
 Chandler:Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.)
 Chandler:Y’know when I said that because we’re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
 Chandler:Yeah that was stupid. Let’s not do that.
 Chandler:Yeah and not that you would but I wouldn’t hang out with…all the guys in my office.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
 Chandler:What are you guys doing?
 Chandler:Oooh I’m afraid that does not exist.
 Chandler:No there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this… (Makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. Henceforth this shall be known as The Face.)
 Chandler:I don’t know what it is I just can’t take a good picture.
 Chandler:Yeah I’m not in that.
 Chandler:All right but I should warn you I’m not going. I’m going. (Does The Face while saying that last part.)
 Chandler:How about those three pointers?
 Chandler:And those guys were this (Doing the standard This Close gesture) close to lettin’ us play this time too.
 Chandler:Yes and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
 Chandler:They have that on the napkins at the club.
 Chandler:Rach if you have a crush on this guy why would you hire him? I mean y’know you can’t date him right?
 Chandler:Dude that is so sad.
 Chandler:Could I play?
 Chandler:Okay. (Does The Face.)
 Chandler:No I am.
 Chandler:I do? (He smiles beautifully.)
 Chandler:Okay. (You’ll have to see it I can’t describe the face he makes but it isn’t good.)
 Chandler:Aww! (Smiles.)
 Chandler:Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
 Chandler:I can’t help it!
 Chandler:Borrow money from me?
 Chandler:Why is there jelly on your shoe?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:(Pause) I’m right here!
 Chandler:I’m still right here!
 Chandler:Did you have a crush on me when you first met me?
 Chandler:Can you people not see me?! (He waves his arms around to get their attention.)
 Chandler:There I am!
 Chandler:Yeah Joey said I uh I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
 Chandler:Yeah and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
 Chandler:I don’t know but don’t worry don’t worry because I know how to take a picture now. (They get ready) Okay see? Look down (Looks down) look down look down… (He falls asleep.)
 Chandler:(awakens) Yeah! (Looks up and does The Face.)
 Chandler:Ahhh.
 Chandler:Oh yeah that looks good.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:I’m marrying her.
 Chandler:Die Hard still great!
 Chandler:What’d you rent?
 Chandler:(looking at the tape) Joey this is Die Hard 1 again.
 Chandler:Yeah I just got uh got plans.
 Chandler:No see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
 Chandler:That’s sweet.
 Chandler:So uh what did this woman look like?
 Chandler:Well is there any chance you were looking into a bright shiny thing called a mirror?
 Chandler:No no I only dated two girls in college both blonde both not attractive… (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
 Chandler:Well let’s see… (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh is that her? (Pointing to the picture.)
 Chandler:Julie Grath my camp girlfriend.
 Chandler:(pause) No we’re still together. Yeah we went out for two summers and then I broke up with her.
 Chandler:Well ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…
 Chandler:I did not say fat! I said Fa-aa-aw-ow…
 Chandler:Yeah. Yeah but it was a really really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
 Chandler:Well you know what they say elephants never forget. (Monica is not amused by that statement.) Seriously good luck marrying me.
 Chandler:Can you figure out what I’m doing?
 Chandler:Who?
 Chandler:Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
 Chandler:What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
 Chandler:Okay I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
 Chandler:(she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing I I guess you remember me.
 Chandler:(To Monica) It’s a nickname I’ll explain later.
 Chandler:Ah uh I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
 Chandler:You-you-you didn’t know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well I guess my work here is done!
 Chandler:As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
 Chandler:I would really love it if could do both.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:A hundred and forty-five pounds.
 Chandler:Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody but I was 15!
 Chandler:Okay. Okay now wait a minute that was totally different.
 Chandler:You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
 Chandler:Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
 Chandler:So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
 Chandler:I’d carry you around in my pocket.
 Chandler:Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.
 Chandler:…Come on! Why are we here?!
 Chandler:The hot chicks?
 Chandler:Wow that’s actually pretty cool.
 Chandler:Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
 Chandler:You didn’t bring me here to do that did you?
 Chandler:OH…MY…GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie are you okay? You didn’t tell her we were getting married did you?
 Chandler:Did she freak out?
 Chandler:Right.
 Chandler:(laughs) You said no right?
 Chandler:You said no right?!
 Chandler:Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check’s in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can’t wait to read your book Ross!!
 Chandler:What do you think she’s just gonna sit there quietly? You don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
 Chandler:Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what? She’s probably not gonna even want to come.
 Chandler:No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
 Chandler:Yes!!
 Chandler:Yes!!!
 Chandler:Well actually uh there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh tiny! We’re not even sure why we’re having it.
 Chandler:I say we go with Careless Whisper.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
 Chandler:Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?
 Chandler:No-no-no-no if we let her stay she will stay forever!
 Chandler:Is that what you’re thinking about right now?
 Chandler:Janice I’m sorry but umm you can’t stay here tonight.
 Chandler:Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized but sadly you have not.
 Chandler:Say again?
 Chandler:Feelings such strong feelings.
 Chandler:I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)
 Chandler:No no no. No-no-no.
 Chandler:No we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
 Chandler:Now that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica).
 Chandler:Oh okay time's up!
 Chandler:Oh that's not bad Pheebs?
 Chandler:Okay so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables Joey?
 Chandler:Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list) There you go.
 Chandler:Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up Ross' pad)
 Chandler:Uh Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad)
 Chandler:I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross time is up!
 Chandler:Look Ross if you don't know them by now you will never know them okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
 Chandler:Okay but if you can't…no dinner!
 Chandler:Sure and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
 Chandler:I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
 Chandler:Which smells delicious!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Tell her I'm allergic and I will sue!
 Chandler:Huh! Where is the dog?!
 Chandler:Phoebe we can hear the dog barking!
 Chandler:What is it doing here?
 Chandler:Extremely allergic okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes my throat will just close up!
 Chandler:(gasping) Really?
 Chandler:Well it still has to go right?
 Chandler:Okay it's um…
 Chandler:(to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say Do what you have to do) Okay I hate dogs.
 Chandler:They are needy they are jumpy and you can't tell what they are thinking and that scares me a little bit.
 Chandler:(scared) Is there a puppy here?
 Chandler:(to Tag) Okay you are new!
 Chandler:Okay it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
 Chandler:And I don't wanna say this I don't you guys to hate me but uh I don't think I can be around that dog anymore. Okay so either the dog goes or I go. (An awkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!
 Chandler:(comes out of the bathroom) Here I am.
 Chandler:How did you…know? (Heads back into the bathroom)
 Chandler:(comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica?
 Chandler:Why not?
 Chandler:Well I I should go in there.
 Chandler:Why not?
 Chandler:This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom)
 Chandler:Monica's all upset because I sent Clunkers away.
 Chandler:Yeah I can be a hero I could do that. I could I could do... I w-w-what if what if it attacks me?
 Chandler:And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out)
 Chandler:No no he went for a walk.
 Chandler:Please please please don't be mad at me.
 Chandler:Okay I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y’know for you and…(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere all over the apartment including the roof which FYI Ross one of your neighbors growing weed. I couldn't find him and I am so so so sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and then over to the street)
 Chandler:Clunkers?! Oh my god!
 Chandler:(to Clunkers) It is so good to see you!
 Chandler:It's up to you.
 Chandler:All right.
 Chandler:You got it. (Starts looking at the pad while Ross got the turkey out of the fridge and starts to unwrap and it) You got Nevada twice.
 Chandler:Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)
 Chandler:Okay let me just straighten out your helmet there. (Does so.)
 Chandler:Okay. Okay.
 Chandler:That sounds like my first bike. (They all turn and look at him.) My dad gave me his old one.
 Chandler:Hey! What are you guys doing?
 Chandler:I’m sorry who?
 Chandler:But we don’t know the neighbors.
 Chandler:Wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved?
 Chandler:Eh somebody’s in a good mood!
 Chandler:Well either that or uh…(Motions towards Joey’s door.)
 Chandler:(about to cry) Am not!
 Chandler:Don’t worry I’m brave! I am brave! I…I am brave! (They get to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through the door.) Can you tell me who is there please?
 Chandler:(laughs) 400 A.M.
 Chandler:I am sorry but some of us have to get up early and go to work! (Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us.
 Chandler:Mm! Night Gar’! (Monica closes the door.)
 Chandler:Hey you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
 Chandler:Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
 Chandler:(with his mouth full) What happened? I’m just eating candy.
 Chandler:Absolutely! Y’know because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
 Chandler:What is the matter with you?
 Chandler:Maybe isn’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
 Chandler:Y’know what would work?
 Chandler:Stop making candy!
 Chandler:You mean they like you.
 Chandler:Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
 Chandler:(asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on?
 Chandler:Joey!
 Chandler:What are you doing?
 Chandler:Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-Lot Lady standing next to the door and smoking to her) Hey and you can not smoke in here! (Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy) Merry Christmas.
 Chandler:All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! (They settle down) What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you and I’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
 Chandler:No not (imitating) Candy Lady.
 Chandler:All right y’know what? Forget it all of you forget it! You’ve ruined it! Go home! You’ve ruined it! You’ve ruined it!
 Chandler:You’re welcome. (They kiss.)
 Chandler:No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh—are you okay?
 Chandler:Buh-bye. (Hangs up the phone) I just got us reservations at Michelle’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
 Chandler:…betrothed couple.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Pheebs?
 Chandler:Skull?
 Chandler:How long have we been home?
 Chandler:Lovely!
 Chandler:Hey you know what I was thinking? When we get married are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
 Chandler:Why not?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
 Chandler:Well she's just so much fun with Joey I just assumed she'd still be living with him.
 Chandler:No reason except…she…told…me.
 Chandler:No! No she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
 Chandler:Bing doesn't seem so weird now does it?
 Chandler:(to the Maitre d') Hi could we get two burritos to go please? (Laughs.)
 Chandler:Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 800.
 Chandler:Is this because of the burrito thing?
 Chandler:Give him money? It was a joke!
 Chandler:Right calm down O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
 Chandler:Hey I can be smooth. (Walks back to the Maitre d' very smoothly) Listen we're a little bit in a hurry so if you can get us a table a little quicker I'd appreciate it. (Shakes his hand)
 Chandler:Okay. (Walks back to Monica)
 Chandler:Had the money in the wrong hand. (Shows her his left hand with the money in it)
 Chandler:How do you know so much about this?
 Chandler:Richard used to do it didn't he?
 Chandler:Mustached bastard…
 Chandler:(walks up to the Maitre d') Excuse me...
 Chandler:(finds his money) Ahh-hahaha! (Turns around to give the Maitre d' his money but he isn't there anymore)
 Chandler:Thank you Gunther put it there. (He gets up and shakes Gunther's hand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely not easier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up the coins. Chandler thinks Joey is just helping him to pick them up.) Thank you.
 Chandler:Hey Pheebs!
 Chandler:If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building why not get him something a little bit more subtle like a wrecking ball or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
 Chandler:(entering in a Santa costume) Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!
 Chandler:Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
 Chandler:Well I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here weird…turtle-man?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:You bet I did Ben put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand but the money falls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well it would have worked this time if his hands weren't so damn small! (Realizes that Ben is standing right there) Ho ho ho!
 Chandler:You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
 Chandler:Fine I'll give the suit back.
 Chandler:Santa? Really?
 Chandler:Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
 Chandler:Then it's okay! (They kiss.)
 Chandler:Because if Santa and the Holiday…Armadillo? (Ross nods) ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
 Chandler:Well I'll stay but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
 Chandler:My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt. (Glaring at Joey who’s nodding.)
 Chandler:Buh-bye. (Hangs up the phone) I just got us reservations at Michelle’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
 Chandler:…betrothed couple.
 Chandler:Hey!

 Chandler:(looking up with her) That’s a plane!
 Chandler:(with a quivering voice) No I’m not!
 Chandler:Because it’s flattering! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come on Monica! (He goes inside.)
 Chandler:(whispering) Monica!
 Chandler:I know just quick-quick question quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
 Chandler:Sorry I just…can’t sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light and Monica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I’m like…(Fake snores.)
 Chandler:What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed and heads into the living room.)
 Chandler:Shhhhhhhhh!!! (Monica enters) I’m sorry I thought maybe I’d make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
 Chandler:It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
 Chandler:Hey y’know what we can do? Y’know now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long y’know like we did when we were first going out. It’d be fun!
 Chandler:Okay so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
 Chandler:(Pause) No. No I-I was I was talking about the book I was reading.
 Chandler:That’s correct.
 Chandler:(startled) What? What? What?
 Chandler:Yeah! You?
 Chandler:(intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope you’re not thinking about cleaning the living room.
 Chandler:Do you know what just happened?
 Chandler:No. We were in the middle of sex…and you fell asleep.
 Chandler:(turning the light back on) Monica?
 Chandler:I was giving you some of my best moves and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Don’t fall asleep! Okay I am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesn’t move as he gets out of bed and as he’s heading for the door.) And I probably won’t spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
 Chandler:Hm-hmm I told you! (Looks at the clock) I can’t believe that I’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
 Chandler:Well you’re not gonna believe this but if you have seven minutes…
 Chandler:Do you wanna?
 Chandler:Couldn’t I just say This is Ross?
 Chandler:(knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.)
 Chandler:Joey! Joe! (Sees that he’s not here and starts investigating. He picks up the bag of chips.) Full bag. (He picks up the beer.) Beer’s still cold. Something terrible must’ve happened here! (He decides it’s not that important; sits down on Rosita and the back falls off causing him to flip over.) Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! (Runs over to Stevie.) Stevie I was never here! (Runs out.)
 Chandler:My chair. Now if anybody asks your name is Rosita! (He runs out the door grabs the back of Rosita and we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are coming up the stairs. Neither of them have reached the landing yet.)
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Yeah I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore.
 Chandler:(excitedly) Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
 Chandler:That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?!
 Chandler:Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey’s chair?
 Chandler:I thought I broke Joey’s chair! That’s why I replaced it with mine!
 Chandler:Well what did you think that-that elves came in and fixed it?
 Chandler:I’m gettin’ my chair back! (Heads for Joey and Rachel’s.)
 Chandler:Joey you broke my chair!!
 Chandler:I think I should get the chair!
 Chandler:Because you (Points to Joey) broke a chair and you (Points to Rachel) broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn’t broke a chair is me!
 Chandler:Well where’s the logic in that?!
 Chandler:So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
 Chandler:What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
 Chandler:(To Monica) She’s not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
 Chandler:No Rach it’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn’t that much fun.
 Chandler:Ross a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
 Chandler:(To Joey) Would you put that back on?! Monica’s gonna be here any minute!
 Chandler:(frustrated) Okay for the last time. It’s not named for each individual man.
 Chandler:Oh well not as lovely as you. I mean I can’t believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And you! I can’t believe that you would have a tux that’s thirty years old! (Puts his hand on Mr. Geller’s shoulder.)
 Chandler:Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)
 Chandler:Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! (Rachel turns off the lights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches a ripping noise erupts from the assemblage.)
 Chandler:(getting up to investigate) Okay everybody stay here. I will find out what’s going on.
 Chandler:Hey-hey are you drunk?
 Chandler:Okay here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
 Chandler:Yes!
 Chandler:Yes!!
 Chandler:Okay here’s the thing. We’re gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you’re drunk.
 Chandler:Yeah I’ll take care of it.
 Chandler:(laughing) Okay we have to do something about your breath.
 Chandler:That’s still yours. Okay now remember it’s a surprise party. So when you go in act surprised.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Okay before we start the celebration Monica has to go put on her party dress.
 Chandler:See? (Does his laugh.) Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room and has to pass in front of Mr. Geller who’s sitting at the table and Mrs. Geller who’s standing next to him.)
 Chandler:(correcting her) Phil.
 Chandler:Now there is a dress laid out on your bed. (Monica stumbles on the steps.) Okay (catches her) you’re doing great. You’re doing great. You’re doing fine.
 Chandler:Monica’s a little drunk.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe) She doesn’t want her parents to know she’s drunk.
 Chandler:Monica’s wasted.
 Chandler:(To Rachel) Okay will you just go help her change please!
 Chandler:Okay open ours next. Open ours next!
 Chandler:For my last birthday you gave me a hug! (To Rachel) Okay read the card! Read the card!
 Chandler:No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
 Chandler:No because you’re not a grandmother!
 Chandler:(to a waiter) Oh that’s great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? (The waiter comes over) There we go.
 Chandler:(To Monica) How are you feeling?
 Chandler:(To Monica) Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more okay? Then we can put you in bed okay? Just smile and don’t talk to anyone.
 Chandler:Pheebs!!
 Chandler:I think it’s necessary. (Backs away anyhow.)
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Okay here we go.
 Chandler:Hey! How’d it go?
 Chandler:Well here we are just a bunch of thirty year olds.
 Chandler:(To Ross) Monica said wedding.
 Chandler:Do you think you could get through a poem?
 Chandler:Too?
 Chandler:Well whatever it is I hope it involves winking. (Winks in a spy-type manner.)
 Chandler:That’s great!
 Chandler:So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
 Chandler:Don’t do it.
 Chandler:I think it’s the dying cat parade.
 Chandler:(turning around and looking) Oh my God!
 Chandler:Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said You’re half Scottish right?
 Chandler:Yes!!
 Chandler:Why is your family Ross?!
 Chandler:If you listen very carefully I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
 Chandler:Well I feel like a snack!
 Chandler:Oh no thanks. I don’t like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
 Chandler:Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway lots of bad memories. (Makes a few unintelligible noises.)
 Chandler:We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
 Chandler:That’s not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
 Chandler:Because we hate them.
 Chandler:We have heard you play.
 Chandler:You mean the spitter?
 Chandler:Easy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a veil.
 Chandler:You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
 Chandler:Sorry I just don’t like the idea of when I say I do he’s thinking Yeah I’d do her too!
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
 Chandler:We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean gay and in control of his saliva!
 Chandler:No but Horny for Monica Minister called wanting to know if we were still together.
 Chandler:Joe…
 Chandler:(To Monica) Y’know we haven’t found anybody else.
 Chandler:Yeah you can do it.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Our minister…
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Should we call the spitter?
 Chandler:Yeah. O-okay.
 Chandler:See Joe not that that’s not grrreat! But one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y’know it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
 Chandler:No not us… (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)
 Chandler:See Joe we want you to tell stories but y’know romantic stories. Nice stories.
 Chandler:Joe?
 Chandler:Isn’t that what happened with you and the bride’s maid?
 Chandler:And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
 Chandler:But then later that night…
 Chandler:(answering the door) Hey!
 Chandler:Well I was… I was exactly expecting company after…(He looks at his watch.) 915.
 Chandler:Well last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh you’re not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
 Chandler:Well look it’s been a really emotional time y’know and you’ve had a lot to drink. And you’ve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
 Chandler:You kidding? You’re the most beautiful woman in most rooms… (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
 Chandler:But we don’t do that.
 Chandler:How drunk are you?
 Chandler:(thinks) That’s the perfect amount!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:Well I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
 Chandler:Yep!
 Chandler:Count of three?
 Chandler:Two!
 Chandler:Well I think it’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
 Chandler:Eh!
 Chandler:Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers as Joey enters. Remember?)
 Chandler:Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e… (Notices that the TV is turned off.)
 Chandler:No! No! No!
 Chandler:They’re in my bag over there. (Points.)
 Chandler:Uh could you leave me one?
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:No I-I-I’m fine.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Who did you originally want to hook up with?
 Chandler:(To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
 Chandler:Oh it’s not important? It’s not important?! If it wasn’t for a bride’s maid you’d be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!
 Chandler:I don’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I’m runner up.
 Chandler:(To Joey) Look there is no way you’re doing this wedding now. Okay?
 Chandler:Okay it’s just weird! Okay? I don’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…I don’t know what I need. I need a walk.
 Chandler:It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman and instead you had to settle for Robin. (Walks out and slams the door.)
 Chandler:Hey. Do you want this scone? (Holds up his plate) It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
 Chandler:Look Joe I know you wanted to do the wedding…
 Chandler:How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
 Chandler:That’s what you should say.
 Chandler:When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say.
 Chandler:I’d love it if you would do it.
 Chandler:But those are the words! Those exact words!
 Chandler:Yeah we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
 Chandler:So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we’re trying to get to play at the wedding?
 Chandler:Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
 Chandler:Gap commercial. (To Monica) So did you book them? Did you call?
 Chandler:Do you want me to call?
 Chandler:Staying out of the way.
 Chandler:Sure! That’s one of the great things about being engaged. I’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
 Chandler:(To Ross) Smooth.
 Chandler:So Ross how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
 Chandler:Huh.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Uh Joe when it’s one o’clock in the morning and you don’t come by? That’s okay!
 Chandler:Really? Right across the street?
 Chandler:When’d you meet her?
 Chandler:Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too!
 Chandler:Hi! How’d it go?
 Chandler:(sarcastically shocked) Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross’s situation?
 Chandler:So this is nice! I wish I didn’t have to go believe me! But unfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh by the way what’s the name the girl you’re dating?
 Chandler:Bye! (Exits.)
 Chandler:Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (He goes into the bathroom to wash his hands.)
 Chandler:(returning) What are you guys talking about?
 Chandler:But I love swing music!
 Chandler:Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them we had fun! And there’s another reason too.
 Chandler:I don’t want to say.
 Chandler:Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
 Chandler:Hi honey! I’m home!
 Chandler:Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
 Chandler:Y’know it’s funny I started it but now it’s scary me. So could you come out here please?
 Chandler:Oh you got a wedding dress? That’s great!
 Chandler:Well then why can’t I see it?
 Chandler:Okay I promise. I’ll-I’ll hate it. (She enters.) Wow! You-you look…hideous.
 Chandler:Yeah that’s like the most ugliest dress I’ve ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
 Chandler:Oh that’s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it’s like yuck! It’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:(without turning around) I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
 Chandler:Oh totally! (Holds up his finger.) Pull my finger.
 Chandler:Okay. Well I think the centerpieces are too big
 Chandler:Kinda. They’re really big.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:No. No see when I first meet somebody it’s uh it’s mostly panic anxiety and a great deal of sweating.
 Chandler:Sleeping with somebody new anxiety panic and I’m afraid even more sweating.
 Chandler:I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. (Monica laughs.) Look for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
 Chandler:Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts I’m back to panic anxiety and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
 Chandler:(hoarsely) Water! Water! Water!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
 Chandler:Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…
 Chandler:Technically we could have sex again. What do you think bossy and domineering?!
 Chandler:That’s me! Come on!
 Chandler:Well get rid of her obsessive and shrill.
 Chandler:(transfixed) Hi! Nice to meet you!
 Chandler:I’ll be right with you.
 Chandler:I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch. (Stares at Monica’s eyes.) Say something.
 Chandler:Umm so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
 Chandler:This is so sad. I mean I only have like ten pins.
 Chandler:Y’know I think we should invite them.
 Chandler:Well this is just sad!
 Chandler:Well thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
 Chandler:(sees another rack) Well what’s the deal with these? These-these look nice.
 Chandler:You mean like for award shows?
 Chandler:You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!
 Chandler:Okay who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)
 Chandler:Not bad.
 Chandler:Who’s that?
 Chandler:Pierce Brosnan?
 Chandler:Are you serious?
 Chandler:007?! This is James Bond’s tux?!
 Chandler:Oh I have to get married in James Bond’s tux!
 Chandler:Oh it’s not just that I would be England’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?
 Chandler:A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James Bond’s tux!
 Chandler:So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.
 Chandler:Please don’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
 Chandler:Look it’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
 Chandler:That was pretty 007.
 Chandler:Ross is Batman!
 Chandler:Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
 Chandler:Batman has a utility belt!
 Chandler:Batman has the Batmobile!
 Chandler:Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get ESPN right?
 Chandler:Actually I don’t like martinis.
 Chandler:Ooh yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)
 Chandler:I would but mine doesn’t fit. The pants are a little tight.
 Chandler:Well does that mean that you’re not going to wearing yours?
 Chandler:(standing up) Let me try it on!
 Chandler:(trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds something in the pocket) What’s this?
 Chandler:An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
 Chandler:The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. (Hands him the jacket and walks away.)
 Chandler:Well you’re welcome. And tell them we’re really glad they’re coming.
 Chandler:(yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!
 Chandler:Whose is it?
 Chandler:Whose is it?
 Chandler:Oh come on! I don’t care! Come on! Whose is it?
 Chandler:Do you realize you get louder each week?
 Chandler:I figured I’d buy those. Pat I’d like to buy a vow. (Laughs)
 Chandler:Right. So uh have you written yours yet?
 Chandler:Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?
 Chandler:(watching in her) (in his head) Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What’s wrong with me? Ooh don’t open that door.
 Chandler:(writing) Monica there are no words… (To Joey and Ross) There are no words! This should not be this hard!
 Chandler:I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should’ve seen her. Writing writing writing!
 Chandler:Yeah I’m not sure I can do that.
 Chandler:(seeing her) Okay.
 Chandler:All right there’s a nuclear holocaust I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
 Chandler:(shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) That’s one?
 Chandler:Oh y’know-y’know what I was looking at it upside down.
 Chandler:(writing) Monica…
 Chandler:(writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?
 Chandler:You'll get one.
 Chandler:All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40 if neither one of us are married what do you say you and I get together and have one?
 Chandler:Oh no no. I just meant hypothetically.
 Chandler:No no no.
 Chandler:(trapped) Uh uh.
 Chandler:Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
 Chandler:Nice try.
 Chandler:Look Monica…
 Chandler:This is not going to work.
 Chandler:You are so great! I love you!
 Chandler:Nothing! I said I said You're so great and then I just I just stopped talking!
 Chandler:No I didn't!
 Chandler:No I didn't!
 Chandler:No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
 Chandler: Y’know I was thinking what if I uh unpack here?
 Chandler:Well what if all my stuff was here?
 Chandler:Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?
 Chandler:Oh my God.
 Chandler:Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God I thought… (Starting to cry pauses) Wait a minute I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you’ll let me I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica will you marry me?
 Chandler:I've had a very long hard day.
 Chandler:Ahh no thanks. No chicken bye-bye then.
 Chandler:Are you okay? I'm so sorry he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
 Chandler:Hey Joe!
 Chandler:Yeah can I get a 3-piece some cole slaw some beans and a Coke—(Yelps in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)—Diet Coke.
 Chandler:It happened in London.
 Chandler:The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
 Chandler:No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
 Chandler:(on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
 Chandler:(after they've left) Okay did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
 Chandler:Okay so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
 Chandler:Phoebe knows about us!
 Chandler:Ahh yes the messers become the messies!
 Chandler:Listen this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
 Chandler:Look she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)
 Chandler:Okay give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
 Chandler:Oh you're-you're going?
 Chandler:(swallowing hard) It's very very nice. Well come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
 Chandler:Not if I kiss you first.
 Chandler:Well I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
 Chandler:Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
 Chandler:Because I'm in love with Monica!!
 Chandler:Love her! That's right I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you Monica.
 Chandler:Yes and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
 Chandler:Who are those people?
 Chandler:What’s going on?
 Chandler:So we both finished our vows.
 Chandler:Don’t worry honey we’ll make yours funnier.
 Chandler:Okay what do you guys think?
 Chandler:You really like it?
 Chandler:I stole Monica’s and changed the name.
 Chandler:Oh! Right. Umm maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation.
 Chandler:I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not the close. I haven’t seen him in years.
 Chandler:Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
 Chandler:Trust me you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
 Chandler:What’s this?
 Chandler:Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—Think of the money we’ll save!! (Monica just looks at him.) We’re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
 Chandler:Y’know we already went over this and I won!
 Chandler:Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see him. I don’t wanna.
 Chandler:No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedoes—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
 Chandler:He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
 Chandler:Does it matter?!
 Chandler:Yeah o-okay but I’m just doing this for you.
 Chandler:So I really never get to win anymore?
 Chandler:Yeah I just ordered a beer! (Pounds the table.)
 Chandler:No! No! I don’t want him to know we’re yet! I’m not sure I’m ready for that. And besides he’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.
 Chandler:I don’t know if I’ve told you this but he’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
 Chandler:Yeah he’s made phone calls written letters he even came to New York but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y’know it’s all very Cats in the Cradle—I don’t want to get into it. (The show starts.) Here we go.
 Chandler:And there’s daddy!
 Chandler:Believe me I’ve been saying that for years. Oh my God!
 Chandler:That’s Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
 Chandler:He’s coming into the audience. He’s coming into the audience.
 Chandler:It can’t happen like this. Okay? I’ll meet you back at the hotel.
 Chandler:(resigning himself to his fate) Chandler. (He quickly sits down.)
 Chandler:Oh they’re a hoot.
 Chandler:Actually Monica and I are engaged.
 Chandler:Wait! Wait! We’d really love it if you could be there.
 Chandler:I know it would make me happy ma’am.
 Chandler:Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
 Chandler:(To Monica) When I was growing up I…played the one on the far left.
 Chandler:Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
 Chandler:The young hot ball and chain.
 Chandler:What’s up?
 Chandler:Listen if you want to borrow money its kind of a bad time. I’m buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
 Chandler:But you’re still my friend?
 Chandler:During this time…are you are you still my best man?
 Chandler:Do I still call you Ross?
 Chandler:(smiling) Hey I hear what your saying okay? And thanks for the warning.
 Chandler:So are we…friends again?
 Chandler:Okay. (Pause) You won’t believe what Monica’s older brother just said to me!
 Chandler:(entering from the bedroom) Okay. Here’s a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
 Chandler:Yes include more people in this.
 Chandler:Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
 Chandler:Well you don’t have to sound so surprised.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Honestly? Me too.
 Chandler:Yeah. Y’know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I’ll go all…Chandler. But nothing has.
 Chandler:Okay. I’ll be right there.
 Chandler:We’re the Bings.
 Chandler:Mr. and Mrs. Bing! (Walks away.)
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:Mom. Thanks for wearing something. (They hug.) (She’s wearing a tight dress with a lot of cleavage showing.)
 Chandler:Hi…dad.
 Chandler:Oh my God! (He and Monica walk away.)
 Chandler:How did you guys find me? I knew I should’ve hid at the gym!
 Chandler:Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I’m related to Monica. How is she?
 Chandler:No! No! No! I can’t do that!
 Chandler:Because if I go home we’re gonna become the Bings! I can’t be the Bings!
 Chandler:The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
 Chandler:No.
 Chandler:It’s not just their marriage! I mean look at yours. Look at everybody’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don’t race cars! I don’t make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
 Chandler:I want to. I love her so much but I’m afr…It’s too huge.
 Chandler:Well yeah but then…
 Chandler:Depends on what you mean by we.
 Chandler:No.
 Chandler:Yeah okay. Well what’s the next little bit?
 Chandler:Yeah. You’re right. Hey I-I can do that.
 Chandler:Okay excuse me for a minute. (Starts to leave)
 Chandler:Ross I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Oh fresh air!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Ross! (He starts to get up.)
 Chandler:(standing up) That’s right! I’m not!
 Chandler:I know about Monica.
 Chandler:Yeah I heard you and Rachel talking.
 Chandler:You don’t know?
 Chandler:Monica’s pregnant.
 Chandler:Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes…
 Chandler:Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop and that’s when I uh saw this. (He holds up a little tiny baby jumper that reads I (heart) New York.) Yeah y’know what? I thought anything that can fit into this can’t be scary.
 Chandler:But come on look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she’d know I was okay.
 Chandler:You look beautiful mom. (His dad clears his throat.) You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. (He kisses his dad on the cheek) I’m so glad you here. (He kisses his mom.)
 Chandler:Are you Joey?
 Chandler:You look beautiful. Is this new? (Her dress.)
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:(in Monica’s ear) He’s Greek Orthodox.
 Chandler:(To Ross) No that’s okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it’s okay because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I’m sure? (He leans in and kisses her.)
 Chandler:I do.
 Chandler:(To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.
 Chandler:Our baby.
 Chandler:Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
 Chandler:Then…who did?
 Chandler:What?! What are you talking about?
 Chandler:Who’s the father?
 Chandler:Why not?
 Chandler:As in Barbara Streisand’s husband James Brolin?
 Chandler:Y’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
 Chandler:Before we go out there I’ve got a present for ya.
 Chandler:No?
 Chandler:I’ve been taking dancing lessons.
 Chandler:Yeah the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.
 Chandler:So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
 Chandler:I don’t know it’s these new shoes they’re all slippery.
 Chandler:Not well.
 Chandler:Thank you.
 Chandler:Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
 Chandler:Funny ha-ha or funny (Mimes blowing his brain out.)
 Chandler:What size shoes do you wear?
 Chandler:Great because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor can I borrow the boots from your costume?
 Chandler:(looking at Joey’s feet) Those aren’t eleven and a half.
 Chandler:And the world will never know.
 Chandler:Yes I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.
 Chandler:But you’re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
 Chandler:Did it turn into sand?
 Chandler:(sliding up behind her) No. No I won’t. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See for the first time I didn’t want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:(to the front desk clerk) Hi! We’re checking out of the bridal suite.
 Chandler:And I’m the happiest guy in the world! (Monica goes and sits down in a huff.) Oh honey come on don’t be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!
 Chandler:We got the honeymoon.
 Chandler:The wedding pictures?
 Chandler:Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
 Chandler:I’ll tell you what I will go get them developed and you can go home.
 Chandler:What? What did you take a picture of?
 Chandler:Okay Ross has the cameras has he checked out yet?
 Chandler:Oh.
 Chandler:Okay well I’m gonna get Ross get the cameras and get them developed. (Joey laughs again.) 32 Joe. You’re 32! (Exits)
 Chandler:Hey. (He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
 Chandler:Yeah but you don’t need—(Picks up something)—What is this?
 Chandler:Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
 Chandler:The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
 Chandler:Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake I went up to you and I said…
 Chandler:So you don’t have the cameras?!
 Chandler:So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!
 Chandler:Great.
 Chandler:Hey! Did you find the cameras?
 Chandler:Yes! And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating.
 Chandler:Well this is great. Y’know those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today she’s really depressed.
 Chandler:All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’t believe I screwed this up!
 Chandler:Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
 Chandler:Are you serious?
 Chandler:Marriage advice? Really?!
 Chandler:I don’t know Monica picked out the flowers.
 Chandler:She picked those out too.
 Chandler:That was her.
 Chandler:I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
 Chandler:(to another couple) Uh excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?
 Chandler:Uhh… Yeah sure. (Holds the camera up to his face.) Click!
 Chandler:Oh yeah. I’ll take I’ll take your picture. (He takes the picture with his finger over the lens.)
 Chandler:Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
 Chandler:Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.
 Chandler:Okay you ready for the last picture?
 Chandler:Get ready to run. (Chandler walks over to the new bride.) Congratulations on your wedding. (He grabs her kisses her Ross takes the picture and they both run out.)
 Chandler:We’re back!
 Chandler:It’s picture time.
 Chandler:(showing her the pictures) Here’s a picture of Ross. (Shows another one.) And that’s me. (Another one.) And that’s me and Ross. (Another one.) Oh-ho that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.
 Chandler:Eh?
 Chandler:Okay so this isn’t a picture of our first but it is a picture of my first kiss with…with this lady. Which by the look on your face I’m sure you’ll remember. So we don’t need—(Rips the picture)—There’s no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.
 Chandler:Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
 Chandler:Call it even?!
 Chandler:Hey! Babe! Aren’t you excited we’re going on our honeymoon?
 Chandler:(singing) Bermuda Bahama come on pretty mama…
 Chandler:I’d better go pack.
 Chandler:A Speedo? Uh I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit. (Goes into the bedroom.)
 Chandler:(entering) Hey what was that all about?
 Chandler:(in a high pitched voice) What?! I didn’t even know that—Why didn’t you tell me?! (Pause) Why am I talking like this?!
 Chandler:(in the high pitched voice) What?! (Normal voice) I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
 Chandler:Oh no-no Joey I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.
 Chandler:You already know.
 Chandler:Oh honey leave them alone they’re in love.
 Chandler:We are on our honeymoon.
 Chandler:25J and K any chance those aren’t together?
 Chandler:No.
 Chandler:Just act like you belong.
 Chandler:Shh! (To the guy behind the counter) Nice to see you again. (They tries to walk past him.)
 Chandler:Yes of course. (Shows him the tickets.)
 Chandler:Oh that’s all right I have it memorized. It’s 1A.
 Chandler:Apology accepted. Excuse us. (They try to enter again.)
 Chandler:Oh you’ve got to be kidding me.
 Chandler:We’re you just ten seconds later!
 Chandler:(looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff.
 Chandler:What else is new?
 Chandler:Wait. Before we go in I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon and I can’t wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.
 Chandler:They’re terrific and they live right here in the city.
 Chandler:I’m sorry we’re just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.
 Chandler:Listen they are really great. If you just got a chance…
 Chandler:We really…didn’t get a chance to…
 Chandler:Ross! It’s got your wavy black lines!
 Chandler:Y’know who has a great video camera?
 Chandler:Let’s call ‘em.
 Chandler:Here you go. (Shows her the number again.)
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:I don’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful great questions.
 Chandler:Yeah we’re gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of them agree.)
 Chandler:I still don’t get it we didn’t do anything wrong.
 Chandler:I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
 Chandler:Well maybe it was all of your questions.
 Chandler:The sheer volume it was like flying with the Riddler!
 Chandler:(angrily) Was that another question?
 Chandler:Did you do it on our invitations?!
 Chandler:So just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (Slams the framed invitation down onto the table.)
 Chandler:That’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
 Chandler:Jenny! That is so Jenny!
 Chandler:You know me sir. Oh ah I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
 Chandler:What’s funny about that?
 Chandler:Hey that’s okay. So where do you want to go?
 Chandler:The Hard Rock Caf�?
 Chandler:Again?!
 Chandler:You like the Purple Rain display! (A guy walks up.) Hey Bob.
 Chandler:Yeah he thinks that’s my name.
 Chandler:Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway so I didn’t say anything. And then the next time he said Hey Toby do you want a donut? And I-I wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later the donut’s gone and I’m still Toby.
 Chandler:No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides we work in different departments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What’s the big deal? It could be worse it’s not like he’s calling me Muriel. (Chandler suddenly freezes into place.)
 Chandler:Shh! It is a family name!
 Chandler:Hey Bob.
 Chandler:If I see him I’ll ask.
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:We’re on a semi-first name basis.
 Chandler:Bob? Ooh working here with us? Everyday? Yeah I don’t know if he has what it takes.
 Chandler:But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.
 Chandler:I think it’s best sir.
 Chandler:Y’know what you should do just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em.
 Chandler:What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
 Chandler:Sure what’s up?
 Chandler:Hey Bobby.
 Chandler:Uhh yeah. Yeah it’s (Points down the hall) right right down there. (When he has Bob looking down the hall he turns around and knocks his nameplate off of his door.) Right there yeah. Can I ask you why?
 Chandler:Okay Bob listen uhh I’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here.
 Chandler:Bob!
 Chandler:Well that puts me in a difficult position.
 Chandler:(entering) Bob. Bob! Bob!!! (He turns around) What the hell are you doing?!
 Chandler:You’re an actor!
 Chandler:(entering from the bedroom wearing a big pink bunny costume) Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen I appreciate you getting me the costume…
 Chandler:The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
 Chandler:No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
 Chandler:How is that me?
 Chandler:When have I ever done that?!
 Chandler:Wow! I don’t have the worst costume anymore!
 Chandler:Oh! Hi!
 Chandler:Joey’s gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you’d come by as a slutty nurse.
 Chandler:You’d think that would embarrass me but you see I’m maxed out.
 Chandler:(To Ross) Marry her.
 Chandler:Howdy doody.
 Chandler:Oh relax man relax. You’re looking a little flushed.
 Chandler:What question?
 Chandler:There’s no question.
 Chandler:(To Monica) You picked Ross?!
 Chandler:I cannot believe you didn’t pick me.
 Chandler:Oh really?! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you prove it? (He pushes Ross who starts to fall backwards until Mona catches him.)
 Chandler:(To Ross) You’re going down.
 Chandler:That means nothing to me. (To Ross) Come on!
 Chandler:And dignity.
 Chandler:Nope! I can do this all day.
 Chandler:God I’m exhausted.
 Chandler:No way! If anything you’ve gotta let me win! My wife thinks I’m a wimp!
 Chandler:You’re Spudnik.
 Chandler:Fine. (He lets Ross win.) Oh no!
 Chandler:Listen I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win.
 Chandler:No I let him win—Ross!
 Chandler:Would you tell her I let you win please?
 Chandler:I am strong! I’ll show you! (He sits down at the table.)
 Chandler:Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?
 Chandler:Okay. 1…2…3—Go! (Once again he’s at a stalemate but this time he’s in pain.) (Pause) I’m gonna kill myself!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Y’know uh I didn’t actually do this.
 Chandler:No it wasn’t you.
 Chandler:I got a maid. Yay!
 Chandler:Uh honey I know you don’t like to relinquish control…
 Chandler:Look she’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
 Chandler:Yes I distinctly remember ‘cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance okay?
 Chandler:What’s the matter?
 Chandler:See? I told you.
 Chandler:(pause) What?
 Chandler:So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
 Chandler:She must’ve been planning this for years!
 Chandler:Honey isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
 Chandler:So shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go…snooping around her crotch?
 Chandler:Out of curiosity what is your secret ingredient?
 Chandler:(entering) Hi!
 Chandler:How come?
 Chandler:To see her pants?
 Chandler:Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
 Chandler:God! She is not stealing from us! Okay will you let this go?
 Chandler:Oh dear God!
 Chandler:And yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.
 Chandler:Here’s another plan…No!
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:I fear a jury will see it the same way!
 Chandler:You see that?
 Chandler:All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
 Chandler:You need new clothes.
 Chandler:I’m leaning. This is where I lean.
 Chandler:Brenda a bee!
 Chandler:Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
 Chandler:You do?
 Chandler:I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I just see your bra?
 Chandler:Her what?!!
 Chandler:You had a bachelorette party?!
 Chandler:I thought we weren’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y’know we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
 Chandler:You went home with the waitress.
 Chandler:I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
 Chandler:My God! You must be good in bed!
 Chandler:She’s okay with Rachel and the baby?
 Chandler:Well you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you’re going down the same path but you’re really going down different ones.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Honey! That’s crazy! I don’t want you to get me a stripper…
 Chandler:Look I appreciate it but uh it’s a little creepy. Y’know? I’m not a bachelor anymore.
 Chandler:All right fine! But I’m only doing this for you!
 Chandler:And Joey.
 Chandler:Ah no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
 Chandler:I understand who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
 Chandler:What are you doing?
 Chandler:Okay. I can’t believe tomorrow’s the big day.
 Chandler:You’re right this is more fun.
 Chandler:Hi. (Joey blows on a noisemaker.)
 Chandler:That’s me.
 Chandler:Yeah yeah right over there.
 Chandler:That was weird.
 Chandler:So she’s a…
 Chandler:I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!
 Chandler:Could be. I mean technically she did strip we just we just missed it. (Walks towards the bedroom.) Ma’am are you also a stripper?
 Chandler:That is funny maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone.
 Chandler:Oh actually I’d rather you…Yeah go ahead. We’re gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
 Chandler:Why would she do that?
 Chandler:This is the worst bachelor party ever!
 Chandler:(To Joey) In a minute? What’s gonna happen in a minute?!
 Chandler:Why me?!
 Chandler:Which is why you should do it.
 Chandler:You do it!
 Chandler:All right Rock Paper Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! (Joey smirks.) What?
 Chandler:I don’t think we’ve actually done this before!
 Chandler:Well we…we still hang out.
 Chandler:Well y’know things are different. I’m…I’m married now.
 Chandler:Yeah I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we’ll make time to hang out with each other.
 Chandler:Her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt do you really want to talk about smoking?
 Chandler:Monica! Wait!
 Chandler:(puts on his crown) Carry on.
 Chandler:Could you not narrate?
 Chandler:I have no idea.
 Chandler:Yeah! I’m just pretending to watch the game so I don’t have to help out with stuff.
 Chandler:Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
 Chandler:Yeah! Anderson just scored again! (To Phoebe) There’s no Anderson.
 Chandler:Oh hey. I’d shake your hand but uh; I’m really into the game. Plus I think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next to each other.
 Chandler:I’m watching the game but I’m not deaf!
 Chandler:(To Phoebe) Y’know it’s been a while since we’ve screamed something. Maybe we should.
 Chandler:Oh come on!
 Chandler:Good game!
 Chandler:Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
 Chandler:(simultaneously) Detroit.
 Chandler:Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
 Chandler:I’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
 Chandler:Did she look 16?
 Chandler:Well she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
 Chandler:Yes I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
 Chandler:New haircut? (Monica nods ‘No.’) Necklace? (No) Dress? (No) Boots? (Monica nods ‘Yes.’) Boots!
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:I’m gonna miss being able to afford food.
 Chandler:She had a point. (Shows her the receipt.)
 Chandler:Yeah well too bad we’re gonna have to return them.
 Chandler:I have you.
 Chandler:Hey-hey.
 Chandler:You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. (Goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)
 Chandler:(returning to his seat) Hey!
 Chandler:(spinning around looking for him) I don’t think you did a very thorough job!
 Chandler:(opening the door) What’s wrong?
 Chandler:Oh don’t forget my office holiday party is tonight. (They go into the apartment.)
 Chandler:Now sweetie I know you don’t like my office parties but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a…supple leather lining.
 Chandler:Why not?
 Chandler:Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
 Chandler:You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts dresses and pants!
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Y’know that party wasn’t bad.
 Chandler:I don’t see any uh cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
 Chandler:What honey it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let’s go.
 Chandler:What’s going on?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. (Pause) It’s oddly unsettling.
 Chandler:Hop on.
 Chandler:Honey I know you’re in pain right now but I’m a little turned on.
 Chandler:Okay ten blocks down. Five to go.
 Chandler:Oh I’m sorry! Do you need a break?
 Chandler:I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.
 Chandler:(pause) I don’t have your boots.
 Chandler:Well why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!
 Chandler:Honey are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
 Chandler:Y’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
 Chandler:Okay. (Moves closer to the window.)
 Chandler:Honey you remember my boss Doug right?
 Chandler:I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced I’m sorry.
 Chandler:No.
 Chandler:Oh yeah. Boy urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn’t it?
 Chandler:Oh uh as it turns out we can’t do it. Monica has to work.
 Chandler:Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.
 Chandler:It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.
 Chandler:Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.
 Chandler:Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
 Chandler:Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell with that bitch.
 Chandler:Oh that’s all right sir and that’s just one girl.
 Chandler:It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no!
 Chandler:Hi honey I’m home.
 Chandler:It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars and then when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring he threw a soda can at a bird!
 Chandler:Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me that we will grow old together and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
 Chandler:Ooh I don’t know if we’re there yet.
 Chandler:Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
 Chandler:Pheebs you didn’t have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang…
 Chandler:Oh okay.
 Chandler:I kinda like it here.
 Chandler:Well what did it do?
 Chandler:A vending machine?
 Chandler:Who cares? It’s a stupid game.
 Chandler:I don’t suck. It’s sucks. You suck.
 Chandler:Why do you want to play this game so bad?
 Chandler:You are not going to believe what I did today!
 Chandler:I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. (Pause) Although I-I hope they don’t.
 Chandler:Uh-huh and I got all the top ten scores I erased Phoebe off the board! High five! (Holds up his hand to give Monica a high five only he can’t straighten his fingers.)
 Chandler:Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours it’ll loosen up. Come on check out the scores. Oh and also look at the initials they’re dirty words.
 Chandler:Because it’s awesome.
 Chandler:Well y’know they only give you three letters so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.
 Chandler:It is when you put it together with that one.
 Chandler:Come on he won’t even know what they mean.
 Chandler:Have you talked to him lately?
 Chandler:No-no-no if you unplug it I’ll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. (She unplugs it.) No! (And plugs it back in.) Hey look at that! Look at that it’s still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM (Read Only Memory it’s a memory chip.) Chip in it or something!
 Chandler:With the claw?!
 Chandler:(smiles) Pull my finger—(Looks at his hand)—My hand is messed up.
 Chandler:I did. (Looks at his still deformed hand) But it came at a price.
 Chandler:Oh come on by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (They both look at him.) Was it just me?!
 Chandler:One more score to go! You can do it! (Touches her shoulder.)
 Chandler:All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
 Chandler:Are you are you high?
 Chandler:Really? I don’t like baths.
 Chandler:Honey it’s not the bath I enjoy it’s the wet naked lady.
 Chandler:Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
 Chandler:Honey it’s 200 on a Wednesday and I’m watching Road Rules how stressed do you think I am?
 Chandler:Oh! Uh yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
 Chandler:Oh my God what’s up?!
 Chandler:Oh no-no no you don’t just come back.
 Chandler:Do you?
 Chandler:In London?
 Chandler:Yes. When Monica and I were in London we were both in London.
 Chandler:If that.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Sex on the balcony?
 Chandler:What is it?
 Chandler:Honey I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
 Chandler:Well this does butch it up a bit.
 Chandler:All right if I do this can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
 Chandler:(thinking) All right this isn’t so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay because I’ve got my boat.
 Chandler:Oh my God.
 Chandler:I’m going to need a bigger boat.
 Chandler:I’m in the bathroom can you come in here? I think there’s something wrong.
 Chandler:I’m in the bathtub.
 Chandler:I drew my own bath but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The salt didn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’t compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!
 Chandler:The bath salts! They’re starting to effervesce! It’s different. (Pause) It’s interesting.
 Chandler:Yeah! Sure sure. So what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!
 Chandler:I had the exact same conversation.
 Chandler:I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!
 Chandler:All right let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
 Chandler:Uh-huh.
 Chandler:He didn’t say anything about that to me.
 Chandler:He was asking all these questions about you me and London. And of course the glue that holds this all together the rules.
 Chandler:But what did he mean by rules?
 Chandler:Because he was looking at her differently.
 Chandler:My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
 Chandler:You don’t say anything.
 Chandler:I’m not going to let you say anything.
 Chandler:Oh God!
 Chandler:Do I smell essential oils?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:L-leaving my troubles behind?
 Chandler:Oh it’s so hard to care when you’re this relaxed.
 Chandler:(upset) Hey!
 Chandler:(To Monica) You told her?!
 Chandler:(sarcastically) Because it’s a relaxing and enjoyable time!
 Chandler:You like Rachel?!
 Chandler:(sarcastically) Yes we’re all in here and we would love for you to join us!
 Chandler:I’ll…I’ll get you later!
 Chandler:Yeah. And what you’re doing feels so good.
 Chandler:You’re not?
 Chandler:Oh sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
 Chandler:Hey Pheebs what’s up?
 Chandler:Buy stamps pick up dry cleaning…Don’t let Phoebe in.
 Chandler:Well Phoebe I thought I’d—(Off Phoebe’s look)—Yeah what the hell. (Exits with Phoebe.)
 Chandler:Hey babe.
 Chandler:Who says you can’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
 Chandler:How about to the street say from the balcony?
 Chandler:Okay. How about in that cabinet?
 Chandler:How about the closet by the bathroom? (The secret green door by the bathroom.)
 Chandler:Oh no-no-no I will do it. Honey you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (Tries the door.) It’s locked you have to help me. Why is it locked?
 Chandler:Oh y’know I’ve been living here a while and I’ve never seen what’s inside that closet. What is what is in there?
 Chandler:Don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
 Chandler:Fine.
 Chandler:(walking casually away) Love you.
 Chandler:Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said If it helps! (Goes to the bedroom.)
 Chandler:I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I swear! (Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.)
 Chandler:Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’s in it.
 Chandler:I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can’t see?!
 Chandler:Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
 Chandler:And here we go…
 Chandler:There has got to be a way!
 Chandler:Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait I’m not an nine-year-old girl.
 Chandler:Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
 Chandler:So how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
 Chandler:That’s a good idea.
 Chandler:Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh Ross is kinda bummed huh?
 Chandler:Well it’s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y’know? You’re doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (He loses his card behind the door.) Richard? If-if you’re in there could you pass me my credit card?
 Chandler:Not to shabby I got this all off myself…using my wife’s tools. (He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see what’s behind the green door! It is stacked floor to ceiling with junk.) Oh my God!
 Chandler:(laughs) You’re messy.
 Chandler:I married Fred Sanford!
 Chandler:No honey you’re not sick! Look I don’t love you because you’re organized I love you in spite of that.
 Chandler:Yes! And look now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we can we share the closet.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
 Chandler:Are you okay?
 Chandler:Happy Valentine’s!
 Chandler:(picking up a video from the table) ‘Candy and Cookie’. ‘Candy and Cookie?’ Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!! (Chandler runs over to the TV puts the tape in and sits down to enjoy some porn)
 Chandler:I love you St. Valentine.
 Chandler:Woah woah that’s not pretty!
 Chandler:Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever! (Chandler starts to press buttons on the remote control frantically.)
 Chandler:I am trying!
 Chandler:(pointing at the video) Why did you get me this?
 Chandler:It’s yelling…bleeding…dilating. Oh the dilating…
 Chandler:I thought…maybe…you got me porn for Valentine’s Day.
 Chandler:Well I’m not really in a sexy mood right now.
 Chandler:Well remember the first time we saw Jaws?
 Chandler:How long it took to go back in the water?
 Chandler:You don’t know. You didn’t see it.
 Chandler:Oh beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful? (picks up the remote and presses a button and he immediately makes a face that just looks like he’s going to throw up!)
 Chandler:See honey there’s—(puts his hand on her leg)
 Chandler:90 seconds.
 Chandler:You know it haunts me? Up ‘til now the worst thing I ever saw was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this I would gladly make that my screensaver!
 Chandler:I can do that.
 Chandler:Okay. Now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair.
 Chandler:Oh I know!
 Chandler:Poor Ross.
 Chandler:Oh great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear but for this he closes the drapes!
 Chandler:Oh and we should warn you before you watch it don’t watch it.
 Chandler:Well let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
 Chandler:(with his arm all the way under the cushion moving it around) This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (Chandler puts the tape in and they all sit down) Okay here we go.
 Chandler:Why have I seen this thing three times?!
 Chandler:Wait you guys look!
 Chandler:No the baby’s out! Look look!
 Chandler:And look how happy the mom is now!
 Chandler:Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) She’s growing inside you.
 Chandler:Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)
 Chandler:I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.
 Chandler:Oh hey!
 Chandler:No. I mean I believe that uh certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love but soul mates I don’t think they exist.
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Come on don’t be crazy. (To Rachel) You don’t think there’s someone out there better suited for Monica than me do ya? (Rachel looks at him.)
 Chandler:A tall guy with hair similar to mine oh unknowable universe!
 Chandler:Luckily the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.
 Chandler:You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?
 Chandler:(mouths to Phoebe) What?
 Chandler:What’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.) On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still there’s staring.) No?
 Chandler:What are you doing?!
 Chandler:I believe in tall handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
 Chandler:Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work huh Don?
 Chandler:Cheese it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
 Chandler:Is it made of cheese?
 Chandler:(disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?
 Chandler:What do we do?
 Chandler:Sure why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here browsing through the personals.
 Chandler:Yeah fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
 Chandler:I’m sorry did you say cheese?
 Chandler:Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates and I don’t believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look I won’t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
 Chandler:No. But I’m sure (mimics Don) ‘tomatoes’ does.
 Chandler:You don’t?
 Chandler:So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?
 Chandler:I love you.
 Chandler:Y’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica doesn’t look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:I don’t see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?
 Chandler:What?! No! No!
 Chandler:(incredulous) I don’t know what that’s like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to I love you was Oh crap!
 Chandler:(interrupting him) We didn’t play it!!
 Chandler:I didn’t know you read tea leaves.
 Chandler:What does yours say Pheebs?
 Chandler:Well I’m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor’s.
 Chandler:Phoebe did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! (Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of The Village People what does that mean?
 Chandler:I know it’s tough now but things will get better.
 Chandler:I’m not great at the advice can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
 Chandler:Let’s just say if I can’t find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
 Chandler:In the James Taylor case.
 Chandler:Honey I’m gonna save you some time 200 CDs not one of them in the right case.
 Chandler:Well if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?
 Chandler:They were just giving those away at the store (off Monica’s look) in exchange for money.
 Chandler:Oh my God honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.
 Chandler:What problem did you tell him you had?
 Chandler:(singing) The sun’ll come out…tomorrow! Bet…your bottom dollar that tomorrow… (The girls start laughing and in a deep voice) …there’ll be sun.
 Chandler:You can always sell your baby.
 Chandler:Wow Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they’re not in the baby buying business.
 Chandler:Oh I’m sorry you’re kicking me out of my own living room?
 Chandler:I’ll be in there. (Goes into the bedroom.)
 Chandler:Oooh did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (Sits up) Who said that?
 Chandler:And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
 Chandler:What are you doing?
 Chandler:It’s a dog.
 Chandler:It’s your parents’ anniversary and you’re going to talk about their dead pet?
 Chandler:Yeah sure. What do you need? We got lace satin sateen raffia gingham felt (Pause) and I think my testacles may be in here too.
 Chandler:Ha!
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:I don’t think the flash went off.
 Chandler:Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
 Chandler:What are you doin’?
 Chandler:Ya know if you want to I can just hold them down and you could (Punches the air).
 Chandler:If only there was something in your head to control the things you say. (Joey nods his agreement.)
 Chandler:Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
 Chandler:No we’re just four people with neck problems. You talk like this. (Out of the sides of their mouths.)
 Chandler:Nice work my friend.
 Chandler:And a bagel with only…
 Chandler:(entering) Hey!
 Chandler:Well I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
 Chandler:All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?
 Chandler:Y’know what we have to turn off the porn.
 Chandler:All right ready?
 Chandler:Two.
 Chandler:Yeah that’s kinda a relief.
 Chandler:You wanna see if we still have it?
 Chandler:FREE PORN!!!
 Chandler:We have free porn here!!!
 Chandler:What’s wrong with you?
 Chandler:This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you—Go to the doctor!
 Chandler:That’s still in there?!
 Chandler:Stick to your side!
 Chandler:Mento?
 Chandler:Thanks.
 Chandler:Well this one's for you.
 Chandler:No I can't. No-no listen I I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry (Puts bracelet on Joey) it's about you and me and the fact that we're (Reading bracelet) best buds.
 Chandler:That's what they'll call us.
 Chandler:It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
 Chandler:You’re turning into a woman.
 Chandler:Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?
 Chandler:Oh my God introduce us!
 Chandler:Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
 Chandler:That’s great.
 Chandler:You’ll be perfect for this! That’s already your name!
 Chandler:Okay I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
 Chandler:Bamboozled?
 Chandler:(simultaneously with Ross) No!
 Chandler:Well Joey I’m a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! (Waves.)
 Chandler:Bogota.
 Chandler:What does a Wicked Wango card do?
 Chandler:Higher or lower than what?
 Chandler:(To Ross) Can you believe how lame this is?
 Chandler:This is ridiculous he’s not gonna hold his breath… (Ross cuts him off by taking a deep breath and holding it.)
 Chandler:Let me see that.
 Chandler:Triscadecaphobia.
 Chandler:Fear of Triscuts?
 Chandler:This game makes no sense!
 Chandler:Oh come on Ross I think we’re all losers here.
 Chandler:Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.
 Chandler:Either it makes no difference.
 Chandler:I’ll take a card.
 Chandler:This game is kinda fun.
 Chandler:I don’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
 Chandler:Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
 Chandler:Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
 Chandler:I’d like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
 Chandler:Six!
 Chandler:(disappointed and simultaneously as Ross) Hungry monkey.
 Chandler:Tell it to the Time Turtle!
 Chandler:(annoyed) Oh come on!!
 Chandler:I’d like a Google Card.
 Chandler:Yes! (Pause) No! (Pause) Google!
 Chandler:Nooo!!
 Chandler:This is the best game ever!!!
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:I’m so sorry.
 Chandler:I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
 Chandler:And people say you don’t pay attention. No this is a much better job. It’s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
 Chandler:That’s what I do now.
 Chandler:The front page? You really do live in your own little world don’t ya?
 Chandler:(entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!
 Chandler:Well I got a job interview. It’s kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I’d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
 Chandler:Me! I do that. So… Seriously do I look okay? I’m little nervous.
 Chandler:Why not?
 Chandler:What about it?
 Chandler:(shocked) What?!
 Chandler:Are you serious?!
 Chandler:What is it that I do?
 Chandler:(To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?
 Chandler:I can’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?
 Chandler:Oh good. Good because I’m sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.
 Chandler:An hour.
 Chandler:Phoebe!
 Chandler:Chandler Bing.
 Chandler:Well you should meet my uncle Bada. (Pause) I’ll let myself out.
 Chandler:…I think you’ll find if I come to work here I don’t micro-manage. I don’t shy away from delegating.
 Chandler:(suppressing a smile) What I do do…is manage to uh create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
 Chandler:Hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.
 Chandler:Oh! (Stands up.)
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:…also I was the point person on my company’s transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
 Chandler:That I did. That I did.
 Chandler:(nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right.
 Chandler:(trying not to laugh) I see.
 Chandler:(really try not to laugh) Good to know.
 Chandler:No don’t I beg of you!
 Chandler:(relieved) Really?!
 Chandler:Yeah I gotta say thank you I was really nervous. Y’know I’ve been told I come on to strong make to many jokes and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesn’t understand) Duties. (Still doesn’t.) Duties! (Still doesn’t.) Poo. (Still doesn’t.)
 Chandler:Oh my God this doesn’t count! Okay? The interview was over that was the real Chandler Bing in there this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There’s a crazy guy out in the hall!
 Chandler:I’ll look forward to your call. (Walks away.)
 Chandler:Let’s. (Everyone gets up and leaves Rachel.)
 Chandler:Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
 Chandler:He’s not snoozing he’s teaching a class.
 Chandler:I haven’t seen this dress.
 Chandler:You really want to take me?
 Chandler:So you’re never actually going to pay me back?
 Chandler:I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.
 Chandler:(in a manly voice) Yeah well I’m gonna go spit. (He goes into the bedroom. On his way out Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)
 Chandler:This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:It’s just so glamorous.
 Chandler:Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
 Chandler:Oh-ho-ho yeah!
 Chandler:The whole thing! Can we go?
 Chandler:I love the specifics the specifics were the best part!
 Chandler:I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
 Chandler:Don’t go! I’m sorry. I’m so sorry! (Sees another guy who is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! (Looks at him more closely.) Or call an ambulance.
 Chandler:Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
 Chandler:I’m so sorry.
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:You don’t owe me anything I don’t want you money…
 Chandler:I don’t know five hundred dollars?
 Chandler:Well then there was the second set the infamous booger head shots.
 Chandler:Do you want a calculator?
 Chandler:Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was right.)
 Chandler:Well uh there was acting classes stage combat classes tap classes…
 Chandler:Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
 Chandler:Yes money well spent!
 Chandler:Okay two three years of rent utilities food…
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:Man if only you’d gotten here sooner. (Ross turns and glares at him.)
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:Okay.
 Chandler:Okay. I’ve been thinking about it too and I I think we’re ready.
 Chandler:But you said you were ready too.
 Chandler:Yes but haven’t you wanted a kid like forever?
 Chandler:I’m not crazy about babies. I’m crazy about us.
 Chandler:Look we’ve always talked about having babies someday. I’m not saying it has to be right now but I’m starting to think that we can handle it. We’re good. We’re really good.
 Chandler:But nothing has to happen until your ready.
 Chandler:What?! It’s not right! We’re not ready to have a kid now!!
 Chandler:I’m kidding. This is going to be fun.
 Chandler:We’re trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing but Chandler stops it.) Y’know I’m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So when do you want to start trying?
 Chandler:Period math?
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Right here?
 Chandler:Wait a minute it’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we’re in a building that’s full of beds!
 Chandler:Okay. (They start kissing.)
 Chandler:Okay. Uh we’ll dim the lights dim the lights. (He goes to the light switch and finds it’s not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) Or turn them out all together. Uh no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. (He sprays an aerosol air freshener above her.)
 Chandler:Yes 98.6. You’re gonna be fine.
 Chandler:Should we tell Rachel there’s an empty private room right next door to hers?
 Chandler:Well let me think about that while I remove my pants!
 Chandler:If it’s not then there’s two of them. And that would mean it’s the end of the world!
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:Weirdest thing. Did I hear—(A nurse opens the privacy screen and Chandler sees Janice)—Mother of God it’s true!
 Chandler:Jan-Janice!
 Chandler:Janice I didn’t even know you were pregnant! Who’s the unwitting human who’s essence you’ve stolen?
 Chandler:What?!
 Chandler:That’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
 Chandler:It’s incredible I mean one minute she’s inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
 Chandler:So do you know what you’re gonna call her yet?
 Chandler:So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
 Chandler:You do?
 Chandler:Oh no it’s gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn’t it?
 Chandler:That was amazing.
 Chandler:And if not we got to do it on a bucket.
 Chandler:He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
 Chandler:Okay. Wow.
 Chandler:Sure.
 Chandler:That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
 Chandler:What?! Why does she think that?
 Chandler:Again what?!
 Chandler:As we all are at some point during the day.
 Chandler:Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
 Chandler:And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
 Chandler:Well what did she say?
 Chandler:Does Ross know?
 Chandler:Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.
 Chandler:If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
 Chandler:Honey we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
 Chandler:I’m so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay but no foreplay.
 Chandler:Hello sir you know Monica.
 Chandler:Look we can’t stay in here forever.
 Chandler:This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. Now let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)
 Chandler:I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there that wasn’t for fun.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why… (To Mr. Geller) Look I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.
 Chandler:That’s funny this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.
 Chandler:Seriously sir my brains? All over the wall.
 Chandler:You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?
 Chandler:Joey you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look like?!
 Chandler:Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
 Chandler:Okay look just do it gently.
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Yea yea. (Pulls the balloon out of his mouth)
 Chandler:No no Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office (Pulls another balloon out of his mouth) Am I producing them?
 Chandler:Couldn’t sleep last night you know then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today the more I worried about it the more I couldn’t sleep.  Y’know? I was like if I fall asleep now I’ll get six hours sleep but if I fall asleep now I’ll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn’t fall asleep.
 Chandler:Hey what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
 Chandler:Walter (nods).
 Chandler:Yep.
 Chandler:(not knowing what he’s saying yes to) Yes.
 Chandler:(enters) Hey.
 Chandler:Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
 Chandler:Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
 Chandler:Umm you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
 Chandler:Okay you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
 Chandler:People who’ve never ever been to Paris.
 Chandler:We’re moving to Tulsa! (Makes a excited expression on his face)
 Chandler:Okay Ms. McKenna she kind of works above my boss she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there and I was sleeping and apparently said yes.
 Chandler:The Sooner State whatever that is.
 Chandler:Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning!  Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
 Chandler:No no but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. (Monica’s not impressed.) I’ll get out of it.
 Chandler:(hears Emma crying) What is wrong with Emma?
 Chandler:Umm ma’am do you have a minute? (She points for him to come in) I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa.
 Chandler:It’s a funny story actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa I didn’t really know what I was saying.
 Chandler:But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting ain’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan alright (he sits down). See here’s the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. See me I love Tulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go there!
 Chandler:No no no! Look Carol can I call you Carol? (Pause) Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son strapping! (She glares at him.) That’s a picture of your daughter isn’t it well she’s lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I’ll call you from Tulsa. (Exits.)
 Chandler:(entering loudly) Hey!
 Chandler:Oh so there can’t be any yelling.
 Chandler:We’re moving to Tulsa
 Chandler:Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! (Walks backwards towards the door) I can’t I can’t hear you. (He runs out)
 Chandler:(enters) Hey what you guys talking about?
 Chandler:Okay our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa  so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.
 Chandler:They said it could be up to a year.
 Chandler:There is nothing like the support of your loving wife huh?
 Chandler:I'm sorry buddy but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:(Enters) Hey!
 Chandler:I've got good news!
 Chandler:Okay I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.
 Chandler:I'm sorry are you just used to saying that?
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
 Chandler:Hey you said that without gagging!
 Chandler:I know what she's talking about.
 Chandler:He saw a therapist?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
 Chandler:Slim Pickings.
 Chandler:No 'Slim Pickings' it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
 Chandler:'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
 Chandler:Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
 Chandler:Honey we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:How far outside?
 Chandler:And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before you said being me with me was more important than any job but I guess now it's old job (Raises his hand) me (Raises his hand) new job.
 Chandler:What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
 Chandler:I think you should take the job.
 Chandler:Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
 Chandler:Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
 Chandler:Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
 Chandler:That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
 Chandler:Well you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy. (They hug)
 Chandler:Of course I will call you. I love you.
 Chandler:Awww. (They hug) Bye!
 Chandler:(Tries to hug Joey but J. moves away) What's the matter Joe?
 Chandler:Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
 Chandler:Well bye Mon bye Ross Rachel bye Emma!
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:I know that too. (They kiss)
 Chandler:(On cell phone) Don't worry I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know that's how. I promise.
 Chandler:(enters singing) Oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plane STOP IT! Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas? 7 o clock maybe I'll hit the gym (sits down) who am I kidding pay-per-view porn.
 Chandler:DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica (smiles)
 Chandler:everything's great just watching some regular television there what a pleasant surprise. (She hugs him and she knows what he was doing so she looks at the TV and sees sharks swimming around thinking Chandler was giving himself a treat to sharks.)
 Chandler:Ok honey. that was close.
 Chandler:Hi honey I'm home!
 Chandler:oh it was great.
 Chandler:well well well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!
 Chandler:(Chandler looking confused) Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.
 Chandler:no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
 Chandler:does what always have to be sharks.
 Chandler:What's going on?
 Chandler:let ME be a part of this!
 Chandler:no they don't
 Chandler:OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel I was just watching regular porn
 Chandler:yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.
 Chandler:You are an amazing wife. (Monica shrugs) No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.
 Chandler:Good morning everyone it�s nice to see our team together for the first time. Now before we get started are there any questions? (colleague raises hand) Yes Ken is it?
 Chandler:(laughs) Well don�t believe everything you hear Ken. (both turning away to files) But yeah that�s true. Alright let�s get started by take a look at last quarter�s figures. (The female next to Chandler starts smoking towards her) Ah Claudia aren�t you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses� ass?
 Chandler:No no no-no-no. I smoked for years then I quit. Right now I can�t remember why. (to everyone) You�re not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?
 Chandler:Alright lo�look. I don�t smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up go ahead it�s fine. (everyone lights up) So you all smoke then? That�s almost rude that I�m not.
 Chandler:(loud) Ken please! No I can�t I can�t smoke. If I smoke my wife would kill me.
 Chandler:I always liked you Ken. (takes a cigarette)
 Chandler:Actually in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
 Chandler:No! I just happened t�do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.
 Chandler:Uch do you think Monica is gonna be able smell it?
 Chandler:Pheebs?
 Chandler:(getting in) Okay something to cover the smell � Oven cleaner! (sprays himself reads label) Unscented!
 Chandler:No thanks I�m good.
 Chandler:(shrinks back) Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane so I�m feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
 Chandler:(still backs away) Alright the truth is I soiled myself during some turbulences.
 Chandler:Yes but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay five. A pack. Two pack�a�a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. (How many cigarettes are there in one pack and how many packs in one carton in the US?) But it�s over I made a decision I�m not gonna smoke anymore.
 Chandler:But those are for you.
 Chandler:I messed up it was a meeting everybody was smoking.
 Chandler:Will power? I�ve watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs (?) without taking the tin foil off.
 Chandler:�kay look Can we just drop this? I�m not gonna smoke again.
 Chandler:You forbid me?
 Chandler:You know I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?
 Chandler:Oh would you say this was the most upset you could be?
 Chandler:Then I might as well � (grabs the cigarettes) do this (lights one exhales). Not really sure what to do now.
 Chandler:Fine. What!?
 Chandler:You serious? (follows)
 Chandler:Right fine I�ll do it but no talking.
 Chandler:And no kissing your neck.
 Chandler:And lots of kissing your neck.
 Chandler:Look I can�t do this. I can�t make luv to you while we�re fighting this way.
 Chandler:That was a celebration of life. Alright look I�m not gonna do this. Alright is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
 Chandler:Mean it?
 Chandler:You are incredible. Unless I�I�m not gonna smoke again. And if I do I promise I will hide it so much better from you. (they kiss)
 Chandler:Yeah let�s celebrate life!
 Chandler:Uhh. You are welcome.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes�no big deal.
 Chandler:Leave it.
 Chandler:You tricked me to get me into bed?
 Chandler:I feel so used.
 Chandler:I would never lie to get someone into bed.
 Chandler:I suppose that Monica will have the � manipulative shrew.
 Chandler:You mean the lully story?
 Chandler:Oh yeah that�s what she says. But maybe you�re not ovulating at all maybe it�s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
 Chandler:(to Joey) You not gonna believe this She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.
 Chandler:What�s the matter with me? Why I�m such a girl?
 Chandler:So you never had sex with a Kennedy have you?
 Chandler:(picking up the telephone answering it with a frog in his throat) Hello? (he clears his throat but he still has the same frog in his throat when he speaks again) Hello?
 Chandler:Honey you're screaming.
 Chandler:(yawning) Oh that's great.
 Chandler:(clearly not so interested) Awesome.
 Chandler:(angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) I'm funny right...? What do you know you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... (laughs about himself but then gets determined again) Save it for inside! (he enters)
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica looks at Phoebe who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah I'm from the waistband Wyoming. But when I was seven we headed over to the crotch.
 Chandler:(laughs but then moves to Phoebe) And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
 Chandler:What's with the word y'all? You know just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that because if so I say why stop there? You know your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter waiter excuse me I'll have the fricken? (Monica laughs) See that's... that's funny with the fricken right?
 Chandler:Yeah he came up...
 Chandler:(to Phoebe) Were you there?
 Chandler:Hey! (Joey doesn't look up but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later when Monica is around I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
 Chandler:(Can't believe what he hears) Well thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.
 Chandler:Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
 Chandler:Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
 Chandler:Yeah!
 Chandler:Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just said and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:What are you guys talking about?
 Chandler:You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? (Monica starts laughing but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh but very fake. Chandler seems happy again.)
 Chandler:You know I don't mind a... male nanny but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh even more fake than before)
 Chandler:If I'd known you guys were coming over I would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)
 Chandler:What is so funny about that? (they realise it wasn't a joke)
 Chandler:Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts laughing hysterically but then gets serious again...)
 Chandler:So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and Ross walk away from the kitchen)
 Chandler:Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
 Chandler:I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler whose wife made him die inside.
 Chandler:Well I'm off to Tulsa so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
 Chandler:Really...? See... that's the thing you gotta keep it smart people!
 Chandler:I love you too. (Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns to Joey.) And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the back.)
 Chandler:See ya! (he leaves the apartment)
 Chandler:Hi!
 Chandler:How come?
 Chandler:Do you have any ideas?
 Chandler:(imitating Monica) Oh and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
 Chandler:Oh well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
 Chandler:So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
 Chandler:mmm That's enough about you!
 Chandler:No no no no no NO! No no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.
 Chandler:We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! (laughs) You don't think he's here do you? (Joey looks around)
 Chandler:(Chandler looks around the place and his eye gets caught by Richard's video collection) Look at these videos. You know I mean who does he think he is? Magnum Force Dirty Harry Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!
 Chandler:There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
 Chandler:Get there faster! (Joey gasps and finally understands...)
 Chandler:I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean what good could possibly come from watching? (sighs) Well we know I'm gonna watch it. (Chandler moves to put the tape in the VCR and Joey enters the apartment)
 Chandler:Don't judge me I'm only human!
 Chandler:I had to! Okay imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?
 Chandler:Some girl...!?
 Chandler:Yeah...!?
 Chandler:Allright I'm gonna watch it... I mean look it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... (laughs nervously) Can it?
 Chandler:Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
 Chandler:Just for a few seconds so I can know what it is... Please?
 Chandler:Why am I hearing cheering?
 Chandler:Football? Just football?
 Chandler:It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer... (Chandler walks to the fridge his back turned to the TV and a moaning sound replaces the cheering of the crowd... Joey's eyes double in size...) What the... (Chandler turns around but Joey already took a sprint for Chandler jumps and floors Chandler in the open space in front of the apartment door...) What are you doing?
 Chandler:Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
 Chandler:Because that's who I am okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.
 Chandler:This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
 Chandler:Oh yeah well poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!
 Chandler:Yeah oh but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
 Chandler:Oh good good. Play more 'cause I wanna see how it ends.
 Chandler:What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
 Chandler:Is that a problem?
 Chandler:Yeah. Hey here's an idea why don't we use our wedding china today?
 Chandler:Honey she keeps canceling on us take the hint.
 Chandler:What is the point of having them if we never use them?
 Chandler:I will explain it to her.
 Chandler:Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!
 Chandler:Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?
 Chandler:What are you going to do?
 Chandler:Well you proved them wrong.
 Chandler:I'll tell you what for the rest of our lives I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:Oh suddenly flowers are feminine?
 Chandler:I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
 Chandler:You know guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>
 Chandler:No if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma Right?
 Chandler:Actually what?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:So if Monica's not around then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
 Chandler:Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
 Chandler:Look I may not know a lot about babies but do you really think I'm not capable?
 Chandler:Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up.
 Chandler:So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die I get Emma. Then my wife dies then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?
 Chandler:Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
 Chandler:Yeah but they're right. I mean I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.
 Chandler:Yeah but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.
 Chandler:Oh yeah well can you picture me saying Go to your room! You're grounded?
 Chandler:You said that to me last week.
 Chandler:Oh no thats okay you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die you don't get Joey.
 Chandler:Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.
 Chandler:Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.
 Chandler:By the way that fight was totally arousing.
 Chandler:Oh yeah? Well thanks.
 Chandler:Okay but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.
 Chandler:Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> Well.. what do you know? I guess I'll be the one who dies first.
 Chandler:Nope...
 Chandler:Yep...
 Chandler:Nope... (Monica walks in) Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know I think you were right I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
 Chandler:Maybe not even then. (Joey walks in)
 Chandler:(coming from the bedroom) Say goodbye elves I'm off to Tulsa.
 Chandler:Yeah we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done I'll be fired.
 Chandler:So who does?
 Chandler:I'm sorry I won't be here.
 Chandler:Thanks. (they kiss) I'll see you New Year's Day.
 Chandler:Did I not mention that?
 Chandler:(thinks for a second then waves his arms exclaiming) AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! (and runs out of the apartment)
 Chandler:All right everybody I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families but there's *no* call (he takes it off) for writing Screw you Mr. Bing! on the back of my chair! (he looks at it) -- By the way you can all call me Chandler.
 Chandler:Hey. Where've you been?
 Chandler:(to the others) You hear that? You may not be with your families but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.
 Chandler:Y'know what I know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) I had a little talk with the boys in New York told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.
 Chandler:Well that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!
 Chandler:I'm sorry. Hey at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses wich by the way none of you have invited me to.
 Chandler:Haha no thanks!
 Chandler:Oh thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
 Chandler:Typical Christmas-y stuff you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...
 Chandler:I can save you time ladies I'm right here.
 Chandler:What? That's terrible!
 Chandler:Oh well that that makes it not terrible.
 Chandler:No not okay you can't look for Monica's presents!
 Chandler:No you don't have to and you can't because I I live here too.
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:No I have a great idea for a present for her.
 Chandler:If I help we can find 'em faster!
 Chandler:OK Pheebs your turn.
 Chandler:And a lemon lime.
 Chandler:And last but not least.
 Chandler:(entering in a Santa costume) Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!
 Chandler:Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
 Chandler:Well I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here weird...turtle-man?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
 Chandler:Why?
 Chandler:But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
 Chandler:Fine I'll give the suit back.
 Chandler:Santa? Really?
 Chandler:Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
 Chandler:Then it's okaaay! (They kiss.)
 Chandler:You know what everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.
 Chandler:Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright look go! Go home okay? Merry Christmas! Go.
 Chandler:Good God's speed good people! (he starts to close the door turns around and sees Wendy) You're not gonna go?
 Chandler:Ah. Thanks.
 Chandler:Ah. (The phone rings; he answers it) Chandler Bing.
 Chandler:Ahh Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
 Chandler:Ah well no it's just uh me and Wendy.
 Chandler:It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
 Chandler:I sent them home.
 Chandler:Uhh uh...
 Chandler:I don't know!
 Chandler:I don't think of her that way you know she's a she's a colleague.
 Chandler:Oh she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
 Chandler:BE-LOW me!
 Chandler:Well she... she didn't win...
 Chandler:Well second prettiest that year; I mean of *all* the girls in Oklahoma she's probably...
 Chandler:Honey there's really nothing to worry about.
 Chandler:I'm serious!
 Chandler:Merry Christmas.
 Chandler:Merry Christmas you guys!
 Chandler:(hanging up the phone) The wife says Hi!.
 Chandler:Ah well she's got this weird idea that uh y'know just because you and I are alone that something is gonna happen.
 Chandler:This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
 Chandler:Whoa-ho back off Missy! (He takes a step back but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)
 Chandler:I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... (She lets go of his tie) Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
 Chandler:(flattered) No... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several steps away from her.) Look I'm I'm married!
 Chandler:I'm *happily* married.
 Chandler:Right. So I'm sorry...
 Chandler:Well look it's not easy to spend this much time apart you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or in this case right on money! ... You know she's amazing and beautiful and smart and if she were here right now ...she'd kick your ass. Look you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But what I have with my wife is pretty great so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
 Chandler:I mean you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
 Chandler:You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
 Chandler:But we don't do that.
 Chandler:How drunk are you?
 Chandler:(thinks) That's the perfect amount!
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:I know.
 Chandler:Well I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?
 Chandler:Okay!
 Chandler:It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
 Chandler:Yep!
 Chandler:Count of three?
 Chandler:Two!
 Chandler:Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
 Chandler:Eh! (They start making out again)
 Chandler:So are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
 Chandler:Y'know I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well I have and the technical definition is two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me then we have to y'know get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.
 Chandler:Really? Okay so...
 Chandler:Y'know I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
 Chandler:Right!
 Chandler:Okay all right all right all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay here's something here's something blue and new.
 Chandler:Let's go! (Starts to leave.)
 Chandler:Oh okay I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
 Chandler:I don't think so.
 Chandler:(looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the sweater.)
 Chandler:No we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
 Chandler:Okay one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)
 Chandler:Ehh.
 Chandler:Look I thought about it too and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
 Chandler:Yeah I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then then that's what we're gonna do.
 Chandler:Eh forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Uh four a boy twin girls and another boy.
 Chandler:Well stuff like where we'd live y'know? Like a small place outside the city where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
 Chandler:Sure you do.
 Chandler:You sure?
 Chandler:I love you so much.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
 Chandler:Monica.
 Chandler:I never want to leave you again!
 Chandler:Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
 Chandler:Yeah! It's a stupid job and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
 Chandler:(realizing) I have *not* thought this through!
 Chandler:I know I I should have talked to you first about it.
 Chandler:Thanks!
 Chandler:(flattered) Ahh...
 Chandler:(to Monica) Here pass these will ya.. (points to the others)
 Chandler:I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides this gift still says I love you guys.
 Chandler:I don't have a *job*!
 Chandler:Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks down on himself checking then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to Monica) Hey d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
 Chandler:I mean what am I supposed to do with myself? 
 Chandler:But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start. 
 Chandler:Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
 Chandler:How long was I in there?
 Chandler:Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
 Chandler:I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time though.
 Chandler:I mean I can write slogans. I mean how hard can it be right? Cheese. It's milk that you chew. Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy. A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?
 Chandler:Honey? Leave it to the pros.
 Chandler:The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones.
 Chandler:No no. But let me show you what I can do. Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood.
 Chandler:Really? That's great!
 Chandler:It's funny. When you said unpaid it sounded like you said unpaid.
 Chandler:Actually we're trying and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.
 Chandler:Whatever I decide to do I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.
 Chandler:Yeah. 
 Chandler:Yeah Ross is here so...
 Chandler:Hey.
 Chandler:Oh yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.
 Chandler:Oh god I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant. 
 Chandler:That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
 Chandler:Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises. 
 Chandler:That's actually why. Look I'm starting a whole new career now and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
 Chandler:Or a year?
 Chandler:It could be less than a year. I mean you've heard my stuff. Pants. Like shorts but longer. (Pause) It'll probably be more than a year. 
 Chandler:Yeah me too. Look I'll just get my old job back. 
 Chandler:I quit and you learn what I do?
 Chandler:I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby. 
 Chandler:Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
 Chandler:Oh and I promise I will not fake it this time.
 Chandler:Hey
 Chandler:Oh she's at home putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
 Chandler:I tried but apparantly singing I will survive in a helium voice - not helping.
 Chandler:Yes Bravo on the hot nanny.
 Chandler:Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
 Chandler:Now that Rachel's gone?
 Chandler:I wasn't staring. I was leering.
 Chandler:Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
 Chandler:Seriously dude 3 years ago.
 Chandler:You don't trust him?
 Chandler:Is this really your long term plan for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
 Chandler:Allright fine but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something more often than not he's going to have sex with it.
 Chandler:Picturing that tree?
 Chandler:Where you going Joe?
 Chandler:Oh. You mind if I join you?
 Chandler:Your thoughts? Plural?
 Chandler:I'm afraid I can't let you do that Joe.
 Chandler:Yes as a matter of fact he did so I can't let you go.
 Chandler:Great novels?
 Chandler:(In a helium voice holding a balloon) I'm sorry I got a little occupied.
 Chandler:(still helium voice) Right behind you big guy! (they both head for the door)
 Chandler:(sings in a helium voice) First I was afraid I was petrified (very happy)
 Chandler:(normal voice) Hi
 Chandler:Oh well someone left this (shows a green jacket). This is yours?
 Chandler:Oh uh well I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said
 Chandler:So are you gonna...talk to her?
 Chandler:You know when That's fine sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
 Chandler:No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
 Chandler:Dude don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
 Chandler:Why did I get married?!
 Chandler:Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
 Chandler:Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male divorced three times
 Chandler:What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
 Chandler:Maybe she didn't move on you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing
 Chandler:Did she go out with him?
 Chandler:Ah! The high road...
 Chandler:Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
 Chandler:I thought I had to make the jokes!
 Chandler:Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler here's my friend Ross right here and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. 
 Chandler:We still got it!
 Chandler:I don't get it neither I mean you're obviously desperate you're asking women how they want to be killed
 Chandler:By drowning or...?!
 Chandler:Well...
 Chandler:Wow it seems serious. What seems to be the problem Ashley Judd?
 Chandler:I am sorry moment to make fun of that please!
 Chandler:It�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
 Chandler:Ok. First of all this is green!
 Chandler:All right I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
 Chandler:Ok you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage well I earned mine
 Chandler:Yeah well I guess you don�t need my help Victor Victoria!
 Chandler:Oh not with my combination of ice cubes aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
 Chandler:And done!
 Chandler:Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
 Chandler:Yeah yeah I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about
 Chandler:No problem.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:I am sorry I am late. You�ll understand when you�ll see Joey.
 Chandler:Really? In front of all this people?
 Chandler:Oh my God!
 Chandler:Are those my wife�s nipples?
 Chandler:I gotta stop this.
 Chandler:You touching yourself out!
 Chandler:�Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine never understood a single word he said but I helped him
 Chandler:See now why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip happening people. Now if you'll excuse me I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
 Chandler:Wow.
 Chandler:Well I think it's great that you're going on a date you know? I mean it sounds healthy. I mean you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
 Chandler:Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
 Chandler:No no no no! No no no no! It's okay it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
 Chandler:I don't do that.
 Chandler:I'll try to stop. Wait did you say until the sixth?
 Chandler:Today is the sixth.
 Chandler:Yes it's also 2003.
 Chandler:It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
 Chandler:Tough crib.
 Chandler:I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
 Chandler:I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
 Chandler:Oh good because as of four o'clock this afternoon I am not.
 Chandler:I - I don't think I can.
 Chandler:Because of Emma.
 Chandler:Sorry.
 Chandler:Well she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
 Chandler:Well I can't say hump or screw in front of the B-A-B-Y.
 Chandler:Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
 Chandler:You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
 Chandler:Emma was doing it!
 Chandler:Ooh she's asleep that means we can...
 Chandler:I think we may have really done it this time.
 Chandler:You may wanna get some more of those too.
 Chandler:Where's Emma?
 Chandler:Don't ask me I was in there canoodling you!
 Chandler:Okay. (Runs out.)
 Chandler:All right all right we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.
 Chandler:No no no.
 Chandler:What? Why?
 Chandler:Your family name is Tribbiani.
 Chandler:(excited) Guys guys I've got great news! Guess what…
 Chandler:Thank you. I got a job in advertising. (Everybody cheers)
 Chandler:Actually it pays nothing. It's an internship.
 Chandler:Right. So it'll be the same except… less sex with you. (Joey nods)
 Chandler:Well it's a training program but at the end they hire the people they like.
 Chandler:Yeah I mean there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink you know grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating 
 Chandler:(grinning awkwardly) Humiliating and noble!
 Chandler:(entering) Good morning everybody.
 Chandler:Oh no no I'm an intern just like you guys… except for the tie the briefcase… and the fact that I can rent a car.
 Chandler:Yeah well I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and you know you gotta start at the bottom.
 Chandler:Right. Look I know I'm a little bit older than you guys but it's not like I'm Bob Hope (he sits down) 
 Chandler:The comedian? USO?!
 Chandler:(entering carrying a large box) Honey I'm old!
 Chandler:I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
 Chandler:Yes but I don't think life experience with these. (He opens the box and takes an inline skate-like sneaker out)
 Chandler:They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
 Chandler:What am I supposed to do with these?
 Chandler:Well first of all they're not called sneakers anymore. Apparently they're called kicks or skids and I think I heard somebody say slorps. (He takes a sneaker) And here look they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause apparently walking is too much exercise. Kids kids roll your way to childhood obesity! (to Monica) Would you help me try to sell these?
 Chandler:No I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for. 
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Putting on the sneakers… thought I'd get into a younger mindset you know to see if it sparked anything…
 Chandler:Yes how's this They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!
 Chandler:(sitting on the couch) You know what… these aren't half-bad! (to Rachel) You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
 Chandler:Alright (He stands wearing the sneakers on) I feel youger already! 
 Chandler:(on the floor) Yah I think I broke my hip.
 Chandler:Okay… (He stands up) You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age…
 Chandler:A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. Just then a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs and the line reads Not suitable for adults! 
 Chandler:Oh thank you sir… or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me (He sits down again)
 Chandler:(over-enthusiastic) I don't know I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset you know and it just started to flow.
 Chandler:The cold weather hurts my hip!
 Chandler:Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
 Chandler:I'm not sure what they did but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
 Chandler:Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
 Chandler:You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
 Chandler:No! We're not borrowing money.
 Chandler:Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
 Chandler:That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
 Chandler:Yeah.... she's not so cute.
 Chandler:Yes dear.
 Chandler:Hey Joe!
 Chandler:Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
 Chandler:And that would have made the official party line. (Joey nods) Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
 Chandler:What? What do you mean you know?
 Chandler:Oh! Right.
 Chandler:Anyway err... I need to borrow some money.
 Chandler:Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! (Joey begins writing a cheque)
 Chandler:Oh ok.
 Chandler:I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
 Chandler:Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
 Chandler:Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
 Chandler:No no! I just love the way you look I am warm for your form.
 Chandler:Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
 Chandler:I mean You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
 Chandler:Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. (kisses monica) Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
 Chandler:Yeah?
 Chandler:But honey you don't have to.
 Chandler:Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
 Chandler:your ass?!?!?
 Chandler:They...do that?
 Chandler:God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
 Chandler:Alright look if it means that much to you a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
 Chandler:(sedated) What?
 Chandler:Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs manueveored a narrow hallway dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
 Chandler:Aaaaand....... hernia.
 Chandler:Ah look on the bright side I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you. (they hug again)
 Chandler:Hey! Ready to go?
 Chandler:What are you doin'?
 Chandler:Great a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
 Chandler:The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
 Chandler:Bet she'd sleep with you now...
 Chandler:Let me see what you wrote about yourself Doctor Paleontology two kids...  (pause) You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!
 Chandler:Maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on Ross' computer) Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had... aaand SEND!
 Chandler:Oh I'm so sorry!
 Chandler:You're not gonna need my help?
 Chandler:Oh good 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)
 Chandler:I believe I read that somewhere!
 Chandler:I respectfully disagree.
 Chandler:Who cares? Nobody reads those things
 Chandler:I don't have a page.
 Chandler:Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
 Chandler:Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
 Chandler:Hang up hang up. And that was a great movie! (Monica hangs up) I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah this will show him here we go (starts typing something).
 Chandler:Oh you'll see my friend.
 Chandler:(faking sympathy) And so young.
 Chandler:Well how you died was funny.
 Chandler:It kills over one americans every year.
 Chandler:You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
 Chandler:Hey Ross I just wanted to apologize... (­looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
 Chandler:Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
 Chandler:No come on you know that's not true.
 Chandler:Well the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
 Chandler:Alright look let's think about this ok do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
 Chandler:Right I mean come on I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service tons of people would come.
 Chandler:Ross what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
 Chandler:Ross don't press send don't press se... !
 Chandler:There you go! Someone came!
 Chandler:(in a mournful voice) Please come in.
 Chandler:Oh yes yes... let me... take your coat.
 Chandler:At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)
 Chandler:Some guy Tom Gordon.
 Chandler:(entering very upset) Ok Tommy that's enough mourning for you! Here we go bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)
 Chandler:Ok! (shuts the door behind Tom)
 Chandler:Please one ridiculous problem at a time!
 Chandler:You gave them one day's notice not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
 Chandler:Oh that's not true. You had an impact on me I mean it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
 Chandler:I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now go hide. (Ross hides in the bedroom again)
 Chandler:Kori? Kori Weston?
 Chandler:Wow! You look amazing!
 Chandler:Chandler Chandler Bing. I'm not gay I'm not gay at all.
 Chandler:Don't listen to him he's in a really bad mood! (lets her in)
 Chandler:I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
 Chandler:I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
 Chandler:Yeah because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!
 Chandler:Still on Amelia Earhart?
 Chandler:Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
 Chandler:(looking around at the others)I'll ask. (To Ross) Boohaki?
 Chandler:Kinda like Joey.
 Chandler:Pie eating contest?
 Chandler:No I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
 Chandler:(hysterical)Don't touch the phone! I'll get it I'll get it I'll get it!! (picks up the phone)
 Chandler:(into receiver)Hello? Hey Charlie what do you know?
 Chandler:(still on the phone)Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.
 Chandler:One of the slots got filled.
 Chandler:Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
 Chandler:Yeah I know.
 Chandler:Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean I wanna get one I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.
 Chandler:I can see the headline now Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm.
 Chandler:Well you wouldn't but we own the paper we can print whatever we want.
 Chandler:Ok so now that you're in what are you gonna do if we win?
 Chandler:Ooh! Calm down ...
 Chandler:You know I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
 Chandler:You're right it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
 Chandler:(looks around) I'll take this one too (to Ross) Uh ... Mommy?
 Chandler:Hello? Hello? Oh hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man I would have slept with him!! .. Alright bye. (hangs up)
 Chandler:Well no Charlie's gonna get that.
 Chandler:He's the boss's son.
 Chandler:What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
 Chandler:Yes there are I just saw them a few minutes ago.
 Chandler:Honey there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
 Chandler:(to Mon) She's right you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...
 Chandler:Let me finish ... (to everyone else) however it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles so screw you the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets from Rachel)
 Chandler:Oh yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
 Chandler:Can I come a little bit closer valuable things are getting squished...
 Chandler:(looking at the answering machine) Hey there's two messages. These could be from work!
 Chandler:Ok here we go! (he pushes the play button)
 Chandler:This is..shhh!
 Chandler:Oh is she related to Ralph Lauren?
 Chandler:Yeah you know I really thought I deserved it. (pause) But... let's go win the lottery... I mean we still have 130 chances to win right?
 Chandler:I got that!
 Chandler:No.
 Chandler:Ah the I'm sorry I rejected you phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. (on the phone getting up from the sofa) Hey Steve.
 Chandler:Oh no no no no I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones getting coffee I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts boobies butt cracks!
 Chandler:Me that guy who just said butt cracks?
 Chandler:Ok well thanks you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow (hangs up).
 Chandler:What? (pause) Oh yeah I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
 Chandler:Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
 Chandler:Thanks man.
 Chandler:Really? What?
 Chandler:(smiling surprised) Oh yeah? (looks towards the kitchen worried) Listen don't tell Monica she'll rip your heart right out.
 Chandler:Wow you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.
 Chandler:Me too.
 Chandler:(To Monica) Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
 Chandler:What? No I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont (shows them a brochure)!
 Chandler:So what do you say? Can you get out of work?
 Chandler:Are you really that busy?
 Chandler:Oh that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. (on the phone) Hi this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it (pause) Oh what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? (pause) Oh can't you make an exception?
 Chandler:(on the phone) Look this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok? (pause) Oh thank you very much! (hangs up) Yeah I'm going to Vermont...
 Chandler:I don't have travel insurance.
 Chandler:Hi Chandler Bing I have a reservation.
 Chandler:New York.
 Chandler:I'm sorry he's a little bit wound up we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
 Chandler:Well that's impossible can you check again please?
 Chandler:Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
 Chandler:Just give us the cheapest room you have.
 Chandler:That's insane!
 Chandler:Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? (pause) We'll take it.
 Chandler:(aside to Ross) What!? They are totally ripping us off!
 Chandler:Great at a hundred dollars an apple we're there!
 Chandler:Dude you're shaking!
 Chandler:USA Today
 Chandler:And I also got... two more apples.
 Chandler:I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
 Chandler:I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh you already got that.
 Chandler:Ok how about this (picks up the remote control)?
 Chandler:Yes but the batteries...
 Chandler:Thank you thank you very much!
 Chandler:No!
 Chandler:Oh we did and you still have all your lamps.
 Chandler:Oh I didn't factor in the room tax.
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:Look we have enough just walk away.
 Chandler:There's a forest right outside.
 Chandler:Ok go quick!
 Chandler:I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table)
 Chandler:(browsing through a diary) Well let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes falling asleep in front of the TV.
 Chandler:I could fall asleep at a play.
 Chandler:(browsing through a diary) Uh let's see who do I hate?
 Chandler:Hey!
 Chandler:Yes but Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
 Chandler:(to Monica) No I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
 Chandler:Where the hell is everybody?
 Chandler:(To himself) oh yes God yes!!
 Chandler:I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
 Chandler:(to Monica) So how did you enjoy the play?
 Chandler:Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
 Chandler:Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it but why wouldn't I because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16 fat single and ready to mingle I was uplifted.
 Chandler:Oh yeah I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me tell me about your first period!
 Chandler:Did somebody sign your bra?
 Chandler:Oh well this was a really important experience for me and I wanted to share it with you.
 Chandler:Can't believe you guys bought that enjoy your slow death (runs away).
 Chandler:I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl right?
 Chandler:(to Joey) So a professor uh?
 Chandler:Oh yeah?
 Chandler:Oh well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it)
 Chandler:We really need to take those tests?
 Chandler:But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
 Chandler:It's weird! In a doctor's office?
 Chandler:(embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause) And in my defense it was a Wendy's!
 Chandler:Yeah ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
 Chandler:Oh yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
 Chandler:I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
 Chandler:Deposit my specimen? You know usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks got it.
 Chandler:Yeah I guess!
 Chandler:Oh Come on!
 Chandler:Why are you here?
 Chandler:(to Heaven) No no no... I mean why? why is she here??
 Chandler:What!?
 Chandler:I'd love to stay but I have eh... (points at the cup) got a hot date... (starts to leave)
 Chandler:(disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves)
 Chandler:(To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?
 Chandler:Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
 Chandler:I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
 Chandler:(Slightly panicky) Yeah but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?
 Chandler:(smiling again) oh oh yeah ok thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...
 Chandler:(stares at her intently then yells) It was a Wendy's!! 
 Chandler:(picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
 Chandler:Hello? Oh hi Doctor Connelly. (pause) No she's not here but you know I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well so what does that mean? (pause) Ok. Ok thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)
 Chandler:Doctor Connelly just called.
 Chandler:Actually it's both of us.
 Chandler:Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
 Chandler:It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It means...
 Chandler:(seriously) It means that we can keep trying but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
 Chandler:I'm sorry.
 Chandler:Well we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
 Chandler:(looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
 Chandler:Oh I can't believe my sperm have low motility because let me tell you when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
 Chandler:Hi.
 Chandler:Oh DAMN IT!
 Chandler:Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (Dr. Connelly glares at him) Wow talking about an inhospitable environment!
 Chandler:(entering) Hey guys!
 Chandler:I think I can safely say that we all have family issues work stuff and/or are sick.
 Chandler:But you come first!
 Chandler:(sitting down on the couch) Ok.
 Chandler:Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
 Chandler:Well... there's surrogacy but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
 Chandler:Yeah.
 Chandler:Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination so... we're talking about sperm donors.
 Chandler:(stopping Joey) ah-ha!
 Chandler:I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
 Chandler:Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner this is Zack from work!
 Chandler:You guys haven't actually met before but boy! You're both polite! (pause) Go to have a seat Zack and I'll get you a beer.
 Chandler:(to Mon) So Zack's pretty nice uh?
 Chandler:So how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
 Chandler:Well we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean look he's intelligent he's healthy he's athletic I mean he is spermtastic!
 Chandler:No I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy get to check him out.
 Chandler:I'm telling you he's great! I mean even if my sperm worked fine I'd think he'd be the way to go!
 Chandler:Ok!
 Chandler:(bringing the beer to Zack) Zack!
 Chandler:So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes those cheeckbones!
 Chandler:You don't like him.
 Chandler:Alright! Just follow my lead!
 Chandler:Oh! Thanks I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
 Chandler:(very seriously) That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
 Chandler:You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness (Monica stretches her neck to look behind Zack's head and then gives Chandler an ok sign)
 Chandler:I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
 Chandler:(Proceeding with his dinner) We're teeth people Zack!
 Chandler:You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
 Chandler:Are you just tired now or are you always tired 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
 Chandler:Ok.
 Chandler:I think we've found our sperm!
 Chandler:Yeah you think so well? Should I ask him?
 Chandler:Why not just because his great-grandmother was obese our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
 Chandler:Yeah he's better!
 Chandler:Really? Are you sure?
 Chandler:(sighs with relief) Thank God because I don't wanna do this either. You know I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know I'm the husband I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
 Chandler:So you know this leaves us with...
 Chandler:How do you feel about that?
 Chandler:Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
 Chandler:(smiling) Yeah.
 Chandler:We are gonna be great parents.
 Chandler:Wait if we're lucky and we're really really really quiet we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
 Chandler:Hey Zack!
 Chandler:Look I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
 Chandler:Really?
 Chandler:My wife and I have some boundary issues you know sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
 Chandler:You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby would ya?
 Chandler:Yeah Ross I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do you know island's stuff.
 Chandler:Yeah that's the same as it has something to do with wind.
 Chandler:(upset) She does?
 Chandler:I wouldn't read too much into it.
 Chandler:David let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice go to Ross Monica or... Joey if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
 Chandler:Seriously we're gonna do this?
 Chandler:Oh because his penis was too big. (he notices that David is not amused) Oh I'm sorry that's the kind of thing I do. (pause) They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
 Chandler:What?
 Chandler:I didn't mean now...
 Chandler:Well you're welcome! Glad I could help.
 Chandler:David I'm pretending to read here!!
 Chandler:(smiling cheekily) I do! Want a hint? huh? I do (Monica looks confused so Chandler repeats) I do.
 Chandler:David is going to propose to Phoebe.
 Chandler:Be-cause we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
 Chandler:I did! A penis one! Look just so I know what was so wrong about what I said?
 Chandler:Man that's some bad advice!
 Chandler:That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
 Chandler:Tonight?! (looks at the ring) Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) Oh there it is!
 Chandler:(slaps him on the shoulder) Nice! (goes to Monica)
 Chandler:Monica can I talk to you for a sec? (Pulls her away from Phoebe and Rachel)
 Chandler:David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
 Chandler:That would be advice!!
 Chandler:Oh is it on the computer cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
 Chandler:(offended) What? (pause) May I?
 Chandler:(at the laptop) Oh no no no dear God no!
 Chandler:Your computer I don't know wha... everything's gone!
 Chandler:It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
 Chandler:Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
 Chandler:Well it didn't say This is a virus!!
 Chandler:Nude... (Ross looks at him)... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
 Chandler:It's not gone! I mean I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy right?
 Chandler:Well you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
 Chandler:I just feel awful.
 Chandler:Well I tried Billy Jean King but... (Ross glares at him) you know you and Monica have the same I'm gonna kill you look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... (Ross continues to glare at him and Chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss Ross)
 Chandler:(pretending not to sense the tone) Oooh! I hope you're happy too honey!
 Chandler:Phoebe is going to say yes? That's that's great!
 Chandler:And there's not chance that will work?
 Chandler:(pointing at her) Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
 Chandler:This vacation sucks!!
 Chandler:You know it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
 Chandler:I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? (doing David) Uh Phoebe uh I would be honoured uh... Spit it out David!
 Chandler:I wouldn't brag too much about that thing big guy.
 Chandler:Oh ain't this nice? It's so quiet I could just lie here all day.
 Chandler:I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
 Chandler:Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
 Chandler:Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
 Chandler:(to a paleontologist sitting next to him) Not to mention the cold sores.
 Chandler:(to the one sitting next to him) Really?
 Chandler:I don't think so!
 Chandler:Because you know how competitive you get and well I say it's cute others disagree and I'm lying!
 Chandler:Oh yeah? What happened when we played last time?
 Chandler:And...?
 Chandler:I'm not playing with you.
 Chandler:She gets crazy! This scar (points to his forehead) is from Pictionary!
 Chandler:(nearly whispering) Oh dear God there's two of them!
 Chandler:(to Phoebe) Did you know this about him?
 Chandler:(interrupting her) OK!
 Chandler:Honey try to focus the trash talk on him!
 Chandler:(to Phoebe) Do you really find this attractive on him?
 Chandler:I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
 Chandler:Okay-dokay you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
 Chandler:Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
 Chandler:(exhausted) Ok look! Enough is enough!
 Chandler:Monica that was also true an hour ago! I mean please look at you! Your hand is blistered you can barely stand your hair is inexplicable! Ok you've already proven you are just as good as he is now we've missed our dinner reservations so now let's just go upstairs order room service take a shower and shave your head!
 Chandler:But...
 Chandler:What about the obsessive cleaning?
 Chandler:You ok?
 Chandler:No you didn't.
 Chandler:Because I'm gonna play for ya.
 Chandler:(In a loving voice) Yes I do. Now I may not understand why you have to win so badly but if it's important to you then it's important to me because I love you.
 Chandler:(Still in a loving voice) You're welcome sweetheart.
 Chandler:All right Mike let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point wins.
 Chandler:And that's... how... it's done!
 Chandler:I never sucked I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
 Chandler:I don't know.
 Chandler:That's why!
