 Rachel: (through wall) Ooh... I love Barbados!
 Rachel: I know Im her!
 Rachel: ooh...
 Rachel: Hey you know before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
 Rachel: What? Ross and Charlie? (Joey nods) Wow! Shes really making her way through the group huh? Ah who am I to talk?
 Rachel: Oh ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows were just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. (Joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) Thats not nonchalant!
 Rachel: Oh... okay just hide!
 Rachel: Coming! Try under the bed try under the bed!
 Rachel: Theres no room under the bed. (looks around because she cant find Joey anymore)
 Rachel: Yeah... (still looking to see where Joey went and opens the door)
 Rachel: Hi...
 Rachel: ...I really dont... (looks around again)
 Rachel: Yeah sure... (looks outside into the corridor if Joey is there)
 Rachel: (clearly not listening and still trying to find out where Joey went) Uh-huh... right... yeah...
 Rachel: (still searching) Oh I know... I know its been really hard for you.
 Rachel: (now looking up at the ceiling) That is hard to say Ross. That is hard to say.
 Rachel: You would think!
 Rachel: Joey!
 Rachel: (still cant find him) How are you doing this?
 Rachel: How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
 Rachel: Ah what is this? Well lets see we kissed for ten minutes and now were talking to our friends about it so I guess this is sixth grade!
 Rachel: All right look you guys... Look we appreciate all the advice but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...
 Rachel: Sure...
 Rachel: Get out!
 Rachel: Are they right?
 Rachel: Yeah... Yeah we can wait we dont have to do anything tonight.
 Rachel: (Joey walks to the door) Although...
 Rachel: I mean you know... Ross and I havent dated in like... six years...
 Rachel: Plus you know he is with Charlie now.
 Rachel: No...
 Rachel: Yeah...
 Rachel: Forgotten.
 Rachel: Nothing...
 Rachel: Nothing... Its really... Its nothing... Come here come here...
 Rachel: Sorry I just uhm... I cant seem to get Ross out of my head...
 Rachel: Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
 Rachel: Okay well keep in mind that by the time youre done theyll probably be serving dinner.
 Rachel: Still nervous?
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Yeah yeah sure! Yeah! (mouths Good luck to Joey and gets up from her seat)
 Rachel: So hi!
 Rachel: So you eh you talked to Joey?
 Rachel: Oh! Thats great!
 Rachel: Oh so everythings okay?
 Rachel: Ah... Well obviously I think so too.
 Rachel: Really? Excited?
 Rachel: Excuse me! (and she walks back to Joey who is still looking very impressed about what Ross said to him. Rachel looks at him and hits him.) You didnt tell him did you?
 Rachel: Oh God! Alright fine. You know what Joey forget it. When we go back to New York I will tell him.
 Rachel: That was one time Ross and they were only like 5 milligrams.
 Rachel: Aaah... Ross actually theres something that I really need to talk to you about.
 Rachel: Okay uhm... alright heres the deal.
 Rachel: What? What is it?
 Rachel: Uh look Ross this really isnt easy.
 Rachel: Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
 Rachel: Well yeah... Okay look its about me and...
 Rachel: Wow! Well clearly this is not a good time.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Well I tried but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now its your turn again.
 Rachel: Yeah cause thats what we do.
 Rachel: Okay that sounds fair. It just means that once again we cant...
 Rachel: No! Of course we can wait. Alright so I guess that means good night then?
 Rachel: Goo--ood night!
 Rachel: Seriously good night!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: We werent doing anything!
 Rachel: Shhh.
 Rachel: No come on that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
 Rachel: Yeah you started it! Ive got to chill.
 Rachel: We feel so terrible about this Ross.
 Rachel: Ross? (to Joey) Can we just close the door?
 Rachel: Ross say something. Anything.
 Rachel: No no no!
 Rachel: Ross this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
 Rachel: No but you know what I mean.
 Rachel: Calm ourselves?
 Rachel: Well what would we be doing?
 Rachel: Feel me up?
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Oh you bet.
 Rachel: Okay well we brought you some wine.
 Rachel: Well maybe the next batch we could all get some.
 Rachel: No awareness.
 Rachel: Look Charlie I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know he normally doesnt drink like this.
 Rachel: Ross you dont even have oven mitts on!
 Rachel: Ooy.
 Rachel: Oh my god are we supposed to answer?
 Rachel: Ross you dont seem okay.
 Rachel: Oh thats okay girls tend not to like me.
 Rachel: You know what Ross? I think were gonna take off too.
 Rachel: No no its just that its getting late...
 Rachel: Yeah thats probably a good idea.
 Rachel: Uh-huh. Okay. You know what Joey I dont think hes ever gonna be okay with this.
 Rachel: Thanks for dinner.
 Rachel: So.
 Rachel: I say ‘cheesy line’ but ok.
 Rachel: I am sorry I don’t know I am sorry I don’t know why I did that!
 Rachel: Ok so sorry.
 Rachel: I am sorry! Again... I dont know I don’t know what happened I must be nervous!
 Rachel: Ok ok ok. I promise I promise I promise I won’t do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.
 Rachel: Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a little weird it’s you and it’s me its just gonna take some getting used to.
 Rachel: Ok let’s work from the top down! (Joey nods but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra Joe!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Ow!
 Rachel: Well this is romantic!
 Rachel: It’s a standard issue bra clasp!
 Rachel: Ok well well Im really Im sorry about that Joey but do you think that maybe on some level you dont want to take off my bra?
 Rachel: (laughing) oooh! Oh oh!
 Rachel: oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
 Rachel: Well it was good.. until we got back to our apartment and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!
 Rachel: Well it wasnt just me alright? He freaked out too! He couldnt even undo my bra!
 Rachel: I do not know whats wrong with us I mean we have kissed before and thats been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
 Rachel: (looking thoughtful) Ok thats true. Thats true we can do this. Youre right youre right we can do this. Were just gonna power through!
 Rachel: (To Joey) No need!! Problem solved we are powering through (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment).
 Rachel: Hey! Got champagne?
 Rachel: Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket the phone is off the hook and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove her bra from under her clothes)...
 Rachel: Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy sexy very sexy sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey clearly very excited) Alright! Lets do it!
 Rachel: Oh! Get over it soldier weve gotta do this! (She pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like that huh?
 Rachel: You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively putting her knees next to Joeys hips.) Lets take this into high gear (She pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)
 Rachel: Yeah baby Ill show you how we do it!
 Rachel: What? Oh my God! Im so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
 Rachel: What is the matter with us?
 Rachel: No I mean with us you know. I mean is it supposed to be this... difficult?
 Rachel: Hi! Hey listen can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
 Rachel: No no no... No I mean... se-x-u-ally...
 Rachel: Well just because it happened that way for them doesnt mean it has to happen that way for us.
 Rachel: Right totally.
 Rachel: Yeah and if doesnt work then well be just one of those couples that never have sex.
 Rachel: I know.
 Rachel: Hmmm... Me too...
 Rachel: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
 Rachel: Aah... I bet youre right.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Love you too... Alright Im going to bed.
 Rachel: Wait you cant go away this weekend! Its Emmas birthday!
 Rachel: Were having a party.
 Rachel: No that day... that wont be her real birthday!
 Rachel: Well cant you just go to Vermont the next day?
 Rachel: And I mean you know you guys... This is a big deal. I mean how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
 Rachel: You know Pheebs when I was little on my birthday my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find em all.
 Rachel: Oh good good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and well give it to her when she is 18.
 Rachel: Oh no its still nap time. But shell be up soon.
 Rachel: I said its still nap time.
 Rachel: Hey Joey will you please set this up for people to put Emmas presents on?
 Rachel: Oh shes still napping
 Rachel: Look I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isnt a really big deal to you but it really is to us ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.
 Rachel: No really she didnt sleep well last night so we cant wake her up.
 Rachel: Oh! Emma might like what?
 Rachel: What did you get her?
 Rachel: Well this sounds like fun! Well you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap so would you mind performing them once now?
 Rachel: (to everybody) All right let’s get this party started huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
 Rachel: So Joey what are you gonna do for us?
 Rachel: Oh ok which one?
 Rachel: (crying) Wow! That was amazing!
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
 Rachel: Is that it?
 Rachel: Ross um don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s in a box in the fridge.
 Rachel: Oh youre gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey Corino’s.
 Rachel: Well anyway they make these great novelty cakes in all different shapes and if you give them a photo they’ll copy it in icing!
 Rachel: Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
 Rachel: Ross what are you talking about? (she sees the cake) oh! Oh my God! They put my baby’s face on a penis!
 Rachel: Why you guys this isnt funny all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
 Rachel: Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back I dont even want it in my home... (Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a piece and yells at him) Joey dont touch it!!
 Rachel: (speaking to the person on the phone again) Yes yes. I still want my daughters picture but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake chocolate frosting with nuts!
 Rachel: (into the phone) No there isnt time to go to the bakery. Were just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright well just tell Emma were gonna be there as soon as we can. (emotionally) Bye...
 Rachel: OOH! God! Sorry!
 Rachel: Emmas awake.
 Rachel: I cant believe this. This is her first birthday. Shes awake. Were not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
 Rachel: Oh why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
 Rachel: (shakes her head) I guess... Oh I just had such an idea of what this day would be like you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing Happy Birthday. Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! (honks furiously and Ross looks at her in disbelief and Rachel looks at him.) They have to learn!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: (she looks at the cake) Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
 Rachel: Well Im very impressed.
 Rachel: I dont care that you left. Im just glad that youre here. Thanks you guys!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh! Emma thats right! Youre that many!
 Rachel: (angrily) NO no science camp!
 Rachel: Oh!... Oh and Emma look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
 Rachel: Oh yeah nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Okay. (they both look into the camera and Ross waves.) Hi Emma. Well your first birthday is over and it was really...
 Rachel: You know Im thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.
 Rachel: Ive never given her a cookie. Have you?
 Rachel: Of course Id be honored!
 Rachel: OH! Whats it the anniversary of? Your first date your first kiss first time you had sex...
 Rachel: Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! (they hug) Wow! You remember Joey?
 Rachel: So now what are you doing here?
 Rachel: (Emma starts crying in the other room) Oh sorry hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
 Rachel: God!
 Rachel: Oh I know isnt she?
 Rachel: All right. Whats your news Amy?
 Rachel: What? Oh my God! To who?
 Rachel: A-And??
 Rachel: No whats he like?
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Huh... wow so hes gotta be...
 Rachel: Sweety I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
 Rachel: Oh... sit down sit down. Oh honey you know I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?
 Rachel: Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm so but anyway listen not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever ever made. Honey you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there somewhere. Someone that is your age that is smart that is fun and that you care about!
 Rachel: Ok.
 Rachel: Ok let’s keep talking.
 Rachel: Amy hi!
 Rachel: Oh good for you!
 Rachel: Yes you are! Oh I am so proud of you!
 Rachel: But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
 Rachel: Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron get off!’
 Rachel: Joey I can’t do that!
 Rachel: Well Joey uhm look I know that she’s difficult but I think it’s really good that she’s here.
 Rachel: No its just... look you know when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
 Rachel: Well uhm... whatever I have really appreciated it cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience but that’s ok.
 Rachel: Amy that’s what I was supposed to wear today that’s why I hung it on the door.
 Rachel: Amy you know what? I was thinking that maybe now itd be a good time for us to sit down and you know talk about your future.
 Rachel: Well what happened?
 Rachel: Oh that is so tacky.
 Rachel: Phoebe that’s huge!
 Rachel: I think it could be kind of great!
 Rachel: (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands together faking excitement)
 Rachel: (Takes the phone) Oh! Thats interesting since she died seven years ago!!
 Rachel: (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh its our nanny! (goes back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok bye! (Hangs up) (To Ross) Thats Molly shes sick. Can you watch Emma today?
 Rachel: Menstrual cramps.
 Rachel: (To Monica Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma?
 Rachel: (To Ross) Great shoot what are we gonna do?
 Rachel: (Thinks for a moment) Well actually...
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Why not?
 Rachel: (Defends Amy) Wha.. well Ellas a nice name!
 Rachel: (Shocked) Wha... the next one?
 Rachel: Ross I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
 Rachel: Ross Im telling you shes giving up getting her eyebrows (points at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?
 Rachel: Absolutely.
 Rachel: (To Emma) Hey! Hi hows my girl?
 Rachel: (sounds excited) Yeah!
 Rachel: (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!?
 Rachel: You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?
 Rachel: Oh my God Oh my God here comes Ross. Hes gonna flip out.
 Rachel: Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emmas head and half her face with it)
 Rachel: Nah I dont really want her to see.
 Rachel: Nothing.
 Rachel: Oh theyre real!
 Rachel: I know I know and you were right Ross. (To Amy) You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
 Rachel: I cant believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
 Rachel: Oh yeah? Since when?
 Rachel: (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What?
 Rachel: (shouting) Babies dont care if theyre slim.
 Rachel: Joey get Amys bags she is moving out!
 Rachel: You put holes in my babys ears!
 Rachel: (gasps) I cant believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
 Rachel: Excuse me?
 Rachel: (yelling) Joey where are those bags?
 Rachel: (doesnt believe what shes hearing) Seriously?
 Rachel: Hips or thighs?
 Rachel: (gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
 Rachel: (embarrassed) Oh I can give you that.
 Rachel: Yeah. I just I kept trying to make you a better person but youre... youre already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
 Rachel: Did you just say Emma?
 Rachel: So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
 Rachel: Thats shocking!
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: My God!
 Rachel: Congratulations! Wow!!
 Rachel: Mmh-mmh!
 Rachel: Oh Pheebs baby thats nice but you know what I think Im ok. Why dont you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?
 Rachel: (angrily) GIVE ME THE BOOK! (she takes it and start reading) Pablo Diaz Brady Smith huh Guy-in-van?
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Phoebe isnt Jethro Tull a band?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Im sorry this sounds like something Im never gonna be interested in.
 Rachel: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it but your bosses didnt. Then that way youre the good guy and theyre the bad guys.
 Rachel: Whos Gladys?
 Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
 Rachel: Well I mean sure of course. But... you already gave that to Monica so...
 Rachel: No I couldnt let you do that.
 Rachel: But I dont want you to.
 Rachel: But I insist harder!
 Rachel: (sarcastic) No no thats ok. You won fair and square. Im so sad!
 Rachel: Did you watch the tape?
 Rachel: But you are a liar.
 Rachel: Well this is going well. (Chandler looks worried)
 Rachel: (surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh shes so nice and big! Oh Monica where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly? (looks around for a spot)
 Rachel: Well hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to the spot where her famous French poster is hanging). That way it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
 Rachel: (jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! Theres nothing above your bed!!
 Rachel: O-oh my God!
 Rachel: Joey what... is... this...thing... doing here?
 Rachel: Joey were not keeping this!
 Rachel: Alright fine. You can keep it. As long as you dont mind that shes haunted.
 Rachel: Well legend has it Joey that... she comes alive when youre asleep.
 Rachel: She climbs out of the frame and then drags her half-a-body across the floor just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky slow voice) And then with her one good hand she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
 Rachel: Well why I told him its haunted. Two can play at this game. (gives Gladys to Monica)
 Rachel: Yes I can! (pushes her back again)
 Rachel: Shes yours!
 Rachel: Shes yours!
 Rachel: Shes mine!
 Rachel: Shes mine!
 Rachel: I want Gladys!
 Rachel: Shes mine!
 Rachel: Shes mine!
 Rachel: Excellent!
 Rachel: Ha ha ha third time this week. Man this does not get old.
 Rachel: Oh dont be such a baby!
 Rachel: Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
 Rachel: Oh hey Ross... Listen I heard about you and Charlie. Im really sorry.
 Rachel: Absolutely.
 Rachel: So uhm... what are you gonna do today?
 Rachel: Oh my God what!?
 Rachel: Ok look Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
 Rachel: (upset) All right well if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
 Rachel: Yes I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! (crying) And it was uneven for weeks!
 Rachel: Ok fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
 Rachel: Ross those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When youre... and there is that moment when you are at the top when you just dont know if youre gonna return back to earth!
 Rachel: All right!
 Rachel: Irrational huh? All right well I’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
 Rachel: Ok careful.
 Rachel: Careful watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
 Rachel: I know (she touches Emma’s head) but they’re just so beautiful! Oh my God I just pulled one out.
 Rachel: Ok.
 Rachel: Ok.
 Rachel: Ok careful ok. (Emma giggles) Oh she’s smiling! Oh my God she does like it!
 Rachel: Awe! (Emma laughs) Oh my God! Looks she’s a little dare-devil! Oh let me push can I push?
 Rachel: Ok. Oh God. (To Ross) Get the camera it’s in the diaper bag.
 Rachel: Oh oh Ross oh my God are you okay?
 Rachel: Ross see! I told you those swings are evil! Alright that is it. That is 
 Rachel: Ross cmon please. Can we just get out of here before somebody else gets 
 Rachel: (looks at him suspiciously) I know what this is all about... Youve always been 
 Rachel: Alright fine. Ill do it.
 Rachel: If you hold a spider.
 Rachel: IF you hold a spider.
 Rachel: Ok... I got a spider. There were two I picked the bigger one.
 Rachel: Ok... (and passes the spider to Ross who holds it in between his hands)
 Rachel: (reluctantly) Ok... O-k...
 Rachel: (more confident) Ok...
 Rachel: whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
 Rachel: A-alright! I can do this.
 Rachel: Thats because hes on your neck.
 Rachel: ROSS!
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: I cant believe this! This is Emmas first Thanksgiving!
 Rachel: Its not? (whispering to Ross) When was she born?
 Rachel: Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
 Rachel: Did you at least win the contest?
 Rachel: Cant wait!
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Well lets see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
 Rachel: Oh my God! Thats the creepiest thing Ive ever heard!
 Rachel: Oh! Phoebe all babies are beautiful!
 Rachel: Phoebe just the idea of pitting one baby against another I mean you know and judging whos cuter just for a trophy...
 Rachel: And a thousand dollars.
 Rachel: ...is something Im very interested in! Oh please do not tell Ross. He still believes that (in a deep voice mocking Ross) whats in the inside is important...
 Rachel: Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
 Rachel: Oh take the clothes of Joeys Cabbage Patch Kid.
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe listen. Well I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. Ive been watching this guy over there I dont think he came with a kid!
 Rachel: Phoebe I think... Its just too weird I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe! Come on! You know what its already three oclock and they havent even gotten to Emmas group yet. We gotta go we got dinner!
 Rachel: Phoebe you have to calm down.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: You heard them say that?
 Rachel: All right okay. Alright lets give to these babies something to cry about!
 Rachel: No what?
 Rachel: No Phoebe I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
 Rachel: Because I already did!
 Rachel: No...
 Rachel: What are you doing here!
 Rachel: And I won!
 Rachel: Yes! (spells it) Y-E-S. Yes!
 Rachel: Yeah. Thats me!
 Rachel: She won a thousand dollars!
 Rachel: Well I dont know you guys figure it out I got to put Emma down for a nap.
 Rachel: Alright Emma is napping... (then to Ross) what happened to your shirt?
 Rachel: You know what we just say that she said it was 5 oclock. Well just act casual. Were not late were right on time. (When she finishes talking a note is pushed from under Monicas and Chandlers door into the hall. Ross picks it up and reads it out loud)
 Rachel: Oh God. This is bad. This is so bad.
 Rachel: Oh hey I have an idea. Why dont we play rock-paper-scissors and whoever loses goes in first. (they all agree) Ready? (they do the rock-paper-scissor thing with they hands and Rachel has paper Phoebe and Ross both have rock while Joey is doing a strange upward wiggling with his fingers. They all look a him confused).
 Rachel: Alright enough enough come on. Lets just all go in at the same time.
 Rachel: Alright come on... (starts to knock on the door) Alright you guys. Were so sorry were late. Please let us in so we can have dinner together.
 Rachel: You guys come on it doesnt matter why were late. Were all here now please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. (A slice of turkey on a piece of aluminum foil is slid under door)
 Rachel: (gasps) Oh I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
 Rachel: Huh... OH MY GOD ITS BRUSSELS SPROUTS. (they all look appalled)
 Rachel: Oh I know... I still have my old key! (She goes in to get it and comes back with her keys) We can just unlock the door.
 Rachel: You know what? I dont want to be with them either but its Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together together. (Goes to unlock the door)
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: So bad.
 Rachel: Dessert?
 Rachel: Congratulatioooons!
 Rachel: Ewww is that what that is?
 Rachel: Yeah! Ill cook!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: I lent them to Ross.
 Rachel: Im so happy for you!
 Rachel: To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: (to Joey) Hey whos Phoebe with?
 Rachel: Do you think Im someone else?
 Rachel: Well believe it or not its true. When Joey and I were together he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out he didnt sleep with anybody else!
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Well its a little low... pick up a little... (Ross picks it up) a little bit more... (he picks it up again) a little bit more... (he takes it off) There you go! (pause) Now throw it away!
 Rachel: Ross please trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now I dont know whos running for president or who that... NATO guy is but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
 Rachel: Hi
 Rachel: what?
 Rachel: Oh! Oh no!
 Rachel: Oh yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
 Rachel: Oh no! Not me! Emma!
 Rachel: Ah this place is great!
 Rachel: Ross look I know that some of this stuff is out there but I mean come on look at this look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). I mean this is just beautiful!
 Rachel: Yeah down from seven hundred you are saving like two hundred bucks!
 Rachel: No no no no! Ross wait! Come on! You know there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt look at these nice pants...
 Rachel: Yes they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
 Rachel: Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please just wear what I suggest and she’s gonna go nuts for you.
 Rachel: (to Phoebe) Why do men keep talking to me like this?
 Rachel: We got some really great stuff!
 Rachel: Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
 Rachel: (looking into one of her shopping bags) Oh no! I took one of Ross bags by 
 Rachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you werent there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are you are!
 Rachel: Hi sure!
 Rachel: Oh God... well it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet n Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out and thats when it hit me how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Yknow I mean I always knew looked familiar but... Anyway I just had to get out of there and I started wondering Why am I doing this and who am I doing this for?. (to Monica) So anyway I just didnt know where to go and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart but youre the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
 Rachel: Ooh I was kinda hoping that wouldnt be an issue... [Scene Monicas Apartment everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV and are trying to figure out what is going on.]
 Rachel: (on phone) Daddy I just... I cant marry him! Im sorry. I just dont love him. Well it matters to me!
 Rachel: Cmon Daddy listen to me! Its like its like all of my life everyone has always told me Youre a shoe! Youre a shoe youre a shoe youre a shoe!. And today I just stopped and I said What if I dont wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse yknow? Or a- or a hat! No Im not saying I want you to buy me a hat Im saying I am a ha- Its a metaphor Daddy!
 Rachel: Look Daddy its my life. Well maybe Ill just stay here with Monica.
 Rachel: Well maybe thats my decision. Well maybe I dont need your money. Wait!! Wait I said maybe!!
 Rachel: Im all better now.
 Rachel: Please no go thatd be fine!

 Rachel: Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! Thats the difference!

 Rachel: Whos Nancy?
 Rachel: Are you serious?
 Rachel: What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? Im doing it Ross is doing it Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
 Rachel: Yeah it is.
 Rachel: Well it is all right? When we were out there today all I kept thinking was I cant believe Chandler is screwing this woman but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
 Rachel: (talking on the phone) Cmon Daddy listen to me! All of my life everyone has always told me Youre a shoe! Youre a shoe youre a shoe youre a shoe!. And today I just stopped and I said What if I dont wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse yknow? Or a- or a hat!

 Rachel: Well Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
 Rachel: Yeah I do. I-I do do that.
 Rachel: Well y’know I don’t want you to be cold.
 Rachel: And a crappy New Year.

 Rachel: Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful. (she got a scarf)
 Rachel: Oh God thats right. I blocked that out.
 Rachel: Oh dyou like it?
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Pheebs I... there isnt gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
 Rachel: Seriously Pheebs its not gonna be that kind of a party.
 Rachel: Nooo! Phoebe of course there is more! I mean Ill just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pees!
 Rachel: Well hes coming from Jersey he said he would get here as fast as he could!
 Rachel: (pretends to be shocked) Uh! The police!
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: All right look we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
 Rachel: No thats ok lets me just get my check book!
 Rachel: This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
 Rachel: I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight Im sooo gonna let them! (They spot Chandler)
 Rachel: It... You can so totally tell.
 Rachel: Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. (They walk towards Chandler) Hey hows it going (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails).
 Rachel: Yeah Rachel. And this (points to Monica) is Ross sister Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do).
 Rachel: Bitchin
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: I am sooo drunk.
 Rachel: (finishing the last of her drink) I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
 Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why dont I just start taking my smart pills now?
 Rachel: (blushing) Oh what a line. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards Chandler and whispers Oh my God!)
 Rachel: Oh well You know I think its kinda really important that I go somewhere where theres sun so Im sort of... (Chandler leans in an kisses her) (She pulls away) Hey!
 Rachel: (She considers it for a second) Yeah okay. (She puts her hands around his neck and they start kissing again)
 Rachel: No wait. No theres gotta be something else that you can do. I mean what skills do you have?
 Rachel: So maybe something in an office.
 Rachel: (to Phoebe) Really?
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Oh Monica made me send her to my mothers. Apparently babies and weddings dont mix.
 Rachel: Uh... November?
 Rachel: Hey Pheebs...
 Rachel: Uhm... you havent told these guys what theyre doing in the wedding yet.
 Rachel: Well this is really awkward (staring at the floor) Oh and I can leave!
 Rachel: (excited and clapping her hands in front of her face) Goody what is it!
 Rachel: What what what no I dont wanna do that.
 Rachel: Happy wedding day!
 Rachel: Ok-dokey Joey listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central all right? Were gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
 Rachel: What dyou want?
 Rachel: Oh Ross cmon please! Dont make this harder than it already is!
 Rachel: Well Chandler said that its really important to him too!
 Rachel: Oh you are the lesser of two evils!
 Rachel: Hi
 Rachel: Even so I think Im gonna pick Ross.
 Rachel: All right fine I pick you.
 Rachel: (not amused by his pun but forcing a smile anyway) Oh my...
 Rachel: Well in my defense you were not supposed to tell each other.
 Rachel: Whos there?
 Rachel: Uh.
 Rachel: You know what I cant do this. I dont know which one of you guys to pick.
 Rachel: (sarcastic) Wow this is a tough one. I think Im gonna have to go with the dog.
 Rachel: Since when do you watch the news?
 Rachel: Wow you know its so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why dont you guys just do it on the street?
 Rachel: Well look its hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldnt ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding youve always wanted!
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe Im so happy for you honey. (she gives her a kiss)
 Rachel: Geez Ross you could have showered.
 Rachel: How was the honeymoon?
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: I did not know you spoke French.
 Rachel: Oh... youre so sexy!
 Rachel: Seriously stop it or Im gonna jump on ya.
 Rachel: Ross...
 Rachel: My father had an heart attack... (crying) ...while I was at Barney’s.
 Rachel: Yeah they said hes gonna be fine but hes still heavily sedated.
 Rachel: No come on Im totally ok. (hugging him) I dont need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
 Rachel: Ok. If you really need to.
 Rachel: Oh I really could.
 Rachel: Ohh... (Ross mouths HA-HA at Monica and takes two cookies and she looks at him angrily)
 Rachel: (stopping a nurse whos coming out of a room) Oh uhm excuse me Im here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
 Rachel: Ross please this is a hospital ok? That actually means something here.
 Rachel: Can somebody please go in?
 Rachel: Ross please dont be so scared of him!
 Rachel: Oh! (They enter. Rachel sees his father lying on a bed with tubes drip and everything) Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh ohhh wow that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain huh?
 Rachel: Oh great Are you gonna be ok?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Uh. (pause) Did you call your parents?
 Rachel: Oh good.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: What do you mean? Youve been in my room before!
 Rachel: Ok I gotta tell ya its really weird when you use my whole name.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Yeah just so weird seeing him like that you know? I mean he is a doctor you dont expect doctors to get sick!
 Rachel: (shes sad) Ow. I dont want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Really I shouldnt feel guilty?
 Rachel: Ok maybe youre right.
 Rachel: Wait wait wait wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
 Rachel: Ok. (She sits on the bed and Ross sits near her) Thank you for coming with me today.
 Rachel: Rachel Green is very happy youre in her room!
 Rachel: I just dont want to be alone tonight.
 Rachel: Wait we wont know that until we do it will we?
 Rachel: Taking advantage? Im giving you the advantage enjoy!
 Rachel: Wow. Ok.
 Rachel: Mhm-mh!
 Rachel: (She turns around very slowly looks at him for a second and then turns back to her coffee) Sure. (She gives him the cup she was pouring for herself without looking at him)
 Rachel: Hmm-hmm. (starts to pour herself a cup of coffee never looking at Ross)
 Rachel: (coldly) Yep.
 Rachel: FYI..
 Rachel: In the future when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it. (she smiles fakely at him)
 Rachel: (sarcastically) Really? Well it seems to me if youd done the right thing I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
 Rachel: Oh stop that!
 Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
 Rachel: Oh really well Ross you know what? I am a big girl. I dont need someone telling me what is best for me.
 Rachel: Oh really really? Well it wasnt very good for me either. (She turns to leave and Ross over takes her and stands infront on her his back to the row of doors leading to the hospital rooms)
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh good.
 Rachel: Okay... Hey listen just before you go I-I again I just wanna say thank you for coming with me.
 Rachel: And also you know I uh I was thinking about what you said you know about the whole sex thing and... its probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
 Rachel: Its a shame though I mean when we did it it was pretty good.
 Rachel: Hey uhm do you remember that one really great time...?
 Rachel: You know it was youre uhm... birthday...
 Rachel: Well I guess thats all in the past now.
 Rachel: (after a pause) Not even one more time?
 Rachel: No matter how much we want it.
 Rachel: Thats what we decided.
 Rachel: ...Its kinda hard though!
 Rachel: You know when two people have a connection you know thats... just seems like such a... waste.
 Rachel: ...Ross?
 Rachel: Just so you know... With us... its never off the table. (she enters her room and closes the door.)
 Rachel: (while entering) Hi you guys.
 Rachel: Ooh Italian! (she also grabs a plate)
 Rachel: Hey you guys... Youre never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
 Rachel: Congratulations!
 Rachel: Ooh! (they hug)
 Rachel: (to maitre d) Hi Im here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. Its spelled like Gukki which could be confusing.
 Rachel: Oh my God! Thats my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
 Rachel: But my... but my boss cannot see me. Im interviewing for another job.
 Rachel: Sssshhhh!
 Rachel: Hi... Im on a date...
 Rachel: Yeah it is. Yeah you know its tough. Single mom career... You gotta get out there.
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Yes hi!
 Rachel: Hi! (to mr Zellner) Excuse us.
 Rachel: Okay. Oh yeah... (whispering to mr Zellner) Oh hes cute!
 Rachel: Wha... My resumé? I wouldnt... I wouldnt call my online dating profile a resumé.
 Rachel: (starts singing la la la la) Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
 Rachel: What? I-I dont.
 Rachel: No I-I-I love it there.
 Rachel: Oh! Its not good.
 Rachel: Well I didnt get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
 Rachel: Well my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that hes gonna have to let me go because Im not a team player. And I said Wait a minute! Yes I am. and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
 Rachel: Oh it... good! Yeah but Im not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
 Rachel: Ah all right. Heres to Ross!
 Rachel: (crying) No its not that. I got fired today. And I didnt get the other job.
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: No its okay you didnt know.
 Rachel: Oh thank you... (looks at his face trying to remember his name)
 Rachel: (Is embarrassed for a moment but it quickly passes) Well now I dont have to. (The man leaves instantly)
 Rachel: (annoyed) Ross what is taking you so long?
 Rachel: (turns around) Mark? Oh my God! (puts the box on the chair and they hug each other)
 Rachel: Im fantastic. You remember Ross?
 Rachel: Oh well (looks at her box and chair) youre not catching me on my best day.
 Rachel: No but its good you know Im gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
 Rachel: Well screw charity work. Whatve you got?
 Rachel: Great! Ill call ya!
 Rachel: (very excited) Oh my God!
 Rachel: Ross! Thats Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
 Rachel: Yes.
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: What? You dont want me to get a job?
 Rachel: Ugh.
 Rachel: Ross you know what? (looks over to the door and sees security staring at them) Okay lets talk about it later there comes security. (Takes her box and leaves. Ross follows her and then returns for the chair. He stands for a moment then pushes it quickly in the general direction Rachel went into and out of the cameras view and then nonchalantly walks away)
 Rachel: (entering) Hi you guys!
 Rachel: Oh it was great. Mark is so sweet.
 Rachel: Oh Ross come on. Hes happily married. His wife just had twins.
 Rachel: He offered me one.
 Rachel: I know its amazing. Its amazing. Its so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
 Rachel: The job is in Paris. (they all stare at each other)
 Rachel: He offered me one.
 Rachel: The job is in Paris. (we see Ross stare in disbelief)
 Rachel: Oh God! Please somebody say something.
 Rachel: I know its huge and its scary and its... really far far away from you guys but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And Ive already talked to them about our situation with Emma and they said theyll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
 Rachel: I mean Ill fly back and forth theyll fly you out... Anything we want.
 Rachel: Thank you! Thank you!
 Rachel: I think it is. (Ross looks very sad. Phoebe and Joey enter.)
 Rachel: I got a really incredible job offer.
 Rachel: Its in Paris.
 Rachel: Look you guys... this is really really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
 Rachel: (walking towards Joey) Joey it would mean so...
 Rachel: Joey...
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: Oh well she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
 Rachel: Oh you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called and gave me my job back!
 Rachel: Yee. I mean it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean that place must have been falling apart without me.
 Rachel: No I’m still going.
 Rachel: When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back the offered me more money! Isn’t that great?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
 Rachel: Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
 Rachel: Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said well do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I dont even know what department that guys in.
 Rachel: Well I took it.
 Rachel: (hesitant) Ye-ah. Yeah! You know the moneys great. Its certainly the easier choice...
 Rachel: Yeah you know was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh absolutely... Oh...! Yeah but you know this is... its fine. Im fine going back to a job where Ive pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can... (she sits down and Ross who is stunned to hear all this follows her example)
 Rachel: Well yeah but I mean it was good scared though you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good. (they both stare around)
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: You really think so?
 Rachel: But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
 Rachel: All right. ALL RIGHT! Im gonna do it. Im gonna go to Paris.
 Rachel: Yeah! Im going to Paris. Thank you Ross!
 Rachel: Oh! Oh Im so happy.
 Rachel: Ok! Cant believe Im risking this again but youre on! All right Joe you remember the rules! Heads I win tails you lose.
 Rachel: Oh that sounds good!
 Rachel: Its all done!
 Rachel: I know... Honey seriously I did it all. The luggage that Im taking is in the bedroom this is Emmas Paris stuff these are the boxes that Im having shipped and thats the sandwich that I made for the plane...
 Rachel: Oh well. Everything that I need (she takes her bag) is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
 Rachel: It should be right next to my plane ticket.
 Rachel: What? Maybe I put it in here (she opens her bag). Oh oh its not in there! Oh no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
 Rachel: Shoot. Oh I cant believe I did this!
 Rachel: No no no. Its ok. Im gonna be fine.
 Rachel: Well Ive been better.
 Rachel: You guys are gonna come and visit me right?
 Rachel: Im gonna miss you so much.
 Rachel: You know what? Uhm I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night but come here (they go into the guest room).
 Rachel: Oh Pheebs I dont even know where to start.
 Rachel: Oh oh. (shes holding the present a transparent bag with a white stick in it). What is this?
 Rachel: Im gonna throw this away but thank you so much for the gesture!
 Rachel: I love you Phoebe.
 Rachel: All right. Well if I gonna do this Id better keep going.
 Rachel: Ok. Monica?
 Rachel: Can you come here with me for a minute?
 Rachel: Mon... Okay... Ive gotta... just say what it is Im gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years would have happened if it wasnt for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...
 Rachel: (starts crying and speaking at the same time making it almost impossible to understand what shes saying) I wouldnt know what Im gonna do without you...
 Rachel: (says something that cannot be understood)
 Rachel: I... I... I... (again saying something that cannot be understood)
 Rachel: (laughs) Oh Im sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I dont get.
 Rachel: Well these arent mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
 Rachel: Well I think youre forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
 Rachel: (to Chandler) Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
 Rachel: Oh honey...
 Rachel: (all mushy) Oh you know what? Lets not say anything else. I love you. (they hug)
 Rachel: Okay. Oh...
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Oh... (holding Rosss shoulder) Well...
 Rachel: I think Im gonna take off. (pats Ross on his back but he looks very surprised)
 Rachel: Oh you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Ross...
 Rachel: You really think I didnt say goodbye to you because I dont care?
 Rachel: I cannot believe that after ten years you do not know ONE thing about me.
 Rachel: Because it is too damn hard Ross. I cant even begin to explain to you how much Im gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day it makes me not want to go... Okay so if you think that I didnt say goodbye to you because you dont mean as much to me as everybody else youre wrong. Its because you mean more to me. So there all right theres your goodbye... Oh!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: WHAT?
 Rachel: So if you think I didnt say goodbye to you because you dont mean as much to me as everybody else youre wrong. Its because you mean more to me.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
 Rachel: It really was. Youve learned some new moves!
 Rachel: Ah.
 Rachel: I know!
 Rachel: Morning!
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Good. You?
 Rachel: Chick and the duck? Didnt they die...
 Rachel: You too. Last night was just wonderful.
 Rachel: I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
 Rachel: Uh-huh. I know. It was just it was just the perfect way to say goodbye. (She hugs him and Ross looks crushed.)
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my moms.
 Rachel: No we decided that I would go ahead and set up first and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
 Rachel: Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck Emma!
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: (touched) Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way but I do. And and when Im in a café having coffee or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun Ill think of you. Aw.
 Rachel: Oh... Bye guys.
 Rachel: Hi! You guys the car-service just got here. I cant believe theyre not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: Hi! Oh my gosh!
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: What... What...
 Rachel: Aw..
 Rachel: Oh my gosh. Wow so beautiful.
 Rachel: Oh you guys I cant believe this. But Ill leave now or Im gonna miss my plane.
 Rachel: Me too. Oh Im just sorry Im not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright I cant say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.
 Rachel: I will. Ross come here.
 Rachel: I just want you to know.. Last night.. Ill never forget it.
 Rachel: Alright now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh theyre gonna really hate me over there.
 Rachel: Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasnt gonna remember any of my high-school French but I understood every word you just said!
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Oh shoot. I had it. Oh I cant believe this.
 Rachel: I have it I have it I have it. Oh okay I cant find it but I remember that I was in seat 32C because thats my bra-size.
 Rachel: Okay fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D we would not be having this problem.
 Rachel: Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
 Rachel: Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! Youre a different person.
 Rachel: Hello?
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Phoebe? Is everything okay?
 Rachel: What? Why?
 Rachel: Oh honey Im sure theres nothing wrong with the plane.
 Rachel: Alright look I have to go. I love you and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.
 Rachel: Oh that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.
 Rachel: I wouldnt worry about it. Shes always coming up with stuff like this and you know what? Shes almost never right.
 Rachel: Well...
 Rachel: Wait what are you doing?
 Rachel: Could I get some peanuts?
 Rachel: This is ridiculous! I...
 Rachel: Yeah okay.
 Rachel: Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
 Rachel: What? What? Ross youre scaring me. Whats going on?
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh my God.
 Rachel: I - I have to get on the plane.
 Rachel: Yes I do.
 Rachel: Theyre waiting for me Ross. I cant do this right now Im sorry. Im sorry.
 Rachel: Im so sorry.
 Rachel: (on the answering machine) Ross hi. Its me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. Its just that I wasnt expecting to see you and all of a sudden youre there and saying these things... And... And now Im just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said and I didnt. I mean I didnt even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh Ive gotta see you. Ive gotta get off this plane.
 Rachel: (on the answering machine) Excuse me?
 Rachel: (on the answering machine) Im sorry. Im really sorry but I need to get off the plane okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.
 Rachel: (on the answering machine) Oh please miss you dont understand!

 Rachel: I got off the plane.
 Rachel: I do love you.
 Rachel: Okay. Cause this is where I wanna be okay? No more messing around. I dont wanna mess this up again.
 Rachel: Okay. You and me alright? This is it.
 Rachel: I know. It seems smaller somehow.
 Rachel: (crying) Do you guys have to go to the new house right away or do you have some time?
 Rachel: Okay should we get some coffee?
 Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
 Rachel: Yeah well word of advice Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time youre gonna find yourself sitting at home listening to that album alone.
 Rachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
 Rachel: Oh God oh God oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under the couch cushions.)
 Rachel: Oh like I wasnt dreading tomorrow enough having to give it back to him... Hi Barry! Remember me? Im the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family! Oh God and now Im gonna have to return the ring without the ring which makes it so much harder...
 Rachel: I know I had it this morning and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...

 Rachel: Oh I am sorry...
 Rachel: Oh but look how straight those noodles are!
 Rachel: Well now how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
 Rachel: So what are you gonna do?
 Rachel: Youre twins?
 Rachel: All right you guys I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.)
 Rachel: The lights please..

 Rachel: Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
 Rachel: Everybody? Shh shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.

 Rachel: Wow you guys this is big.
 Rachel: That had to hurt!
 Rachel: Alright somebody.
 Rachel: Um... Ross?
 Rachel: Oh come on I already went.
 Rachel: Oh alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh the foot of the bed.
 Rachel: I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion you know where you have to have somebody right there in the middle of a theme park.
 Rachel: There well see? Barry wouldnt even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
 Rachel: No he said we were holding up the people behind us.
 Rachel: I mean do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
 Rachel: Yeah right.
 Rachel: (sigh) OK.
 Rachel: You dont.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: You do?
 Rachel: Oh Ross youre so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)
 Rachel: What are you shushing?
 Rachel: Ahhhh!
 Rachel: Huh. (she agrees but looks very confused)
 Rachel: Hmmm... this is so nice.
 Rachel: OK.
 Rachel: Ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind Ross)
 Rachel: Oh look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross)
 Rachel: During a blackout? Hed get trampled!

 Rachel: Oh... Italy I think.
 Rachel: Well the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolos cat!
 Rachel: Oh I found him. He was Paolos cat.
 Rachel: Ah Paolo this is Phoebe.
 Rachel: I have absolutely no idea.
 Rachel: (to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God you guys what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
 Rachel: God the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
 Rachel: Yknow I know its totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common and we dont even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
 Rachel: Um... yeah. Well I mean when I first met you yknow I thought maybe possibly you might be...
 Rachel: Yeah but then you spent Phoebes entire birthday party talking to my breasts so then I figured maybe not.
 Rachel: Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno caro mio.
 Rachel: Monica your dad just beeped in but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) Im talking to Rome.
 Rachel: (exasperated) Yes Chandler thats exactly what it is. Its your hair.

 Rachel: Okay. Ah well we’ll just see about that okay. I will read The Shining (she tries to take the book away from him but he doesn’t want to let it go) and you will read Little Women.
 Rachel: All right.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Yeah.

 Rachel: All right okay Laurie proposes to Jo and she says no even though she’s still in love with him and then he ends up marring Amy.
 Rachel: Eh. Beth dies.
 Rachel: Um-hmm.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: No. She doesn’t die.
 Rachel: Because I wanted to hurt you.

 Rachel: Yeah at the lecture I told you that last week you said you didn’t mind.
 Rachel: Oh please tell me it’s not because I’m going with Mark.
 Rachel: Oh my God!!! Ross!!
 Rachel: Because he’s my friend.
 Rachel: Okay well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler can I play with Mark?
 Rachel: I don’t know you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny. Look honey Mark is in fashion okay I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
 Rachel: Really!?
 Rachel: Okay. Honey I would love for you to go with me. (Ross has a worried look on his face) What?
 Rachel: Oh. (puts her hand over his mouth)
 Rachel: Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father’s boat didn’t make that much noise when it hit rocks!
 Rachel: Well okay how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we didn’t know it had!’
 Rachel: Okay see now what I just heard blah-blah-blah blah-blah-blah-blah-blah blah-blah-blah blah blah.
 Rachel: Oh that is so...
 Rachel: Yknow if what I do is so lame then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?
 Rachel: It’s not dumb. But maybe it’s okay that you’re not a part of it. Yknow what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean it’s like I-I-I like that you’re not involved in that part of my life.
 Rachel: Honey see it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I do. I love you I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me yknow I’m out there on my own and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it because it’s mine. I but I mean is that okay?
 Rachel: What?!!
 Rachel: (answering her phone at work) Hello.
 Rachel: Oh hi.
 Rachel: Well there was a disaster in shipping and I’ve got to get this order in. Honey I’m so sorry but it looks like I’m gonna be here all night.
 Rachel: No-no-no no honey please I’ve got I’ve just have so much to deal with.
 Rachel: (on the phone) No no no I’m looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And....

 Rachel: (angrily) None for me.
 Rachel: I’m sorry as I was saying the store number is wrong and I’m sorry but that’s... (notices a fire that Ross’s candle has started) Oh my God!!
 Rachel: (on phone) Excuse me I’m sorry I’m gonna have to call you back I’ve got a Schemp in my office. (hangs up) (to Ross) What are you doing?
 Rachel: Ross you’re not listening to me I don’t have time to stop.

 Rachel: Good bye!
 Rachel: Hi. Look um about what happened earlier...
 Rachel: (throws her stuff down) I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
 Rachel: You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody’s work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
 Rachel: But I told you I didn’t have the time!
 Rachel: Wh Ross what do you want from me? You want me you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
 Rachel: Just a job!

 Rachel: Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again Ross no you’re you’re you’re making this too hard.
 Rachel: I don’t know I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look maybe we should take a break.

 Rachel: No! Really no please please that’s that’s okay.
 Rachel: Oh yeah I’m not I’m not hungry.
 Rachel: Oh. Okay bye.
 Rachel: Oh and then we got into this big stupid fight. I just it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger or something oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break I don’t want to take a break.
 Rachel: No. (grabs an eggroll) And then I called him and he wasn’t there.
 Rachel: Oh thank you that’s very helpful I’m glad you came over.

 Rachel: Yeah but it’s okay because when Ross left Mark came over.
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: No no-no it’s okay calm down. Mark and I talked and I realised how much I love your stupid brother and yeah we got our problems but I really want to make it work.
 Rachel: (on answering machine) Hi it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please Ross you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
 Rachel: Eh I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And I yknow I don’t want to get back together over a machine.
 Rachel: So I love you.
 Rachel: And yknow what I’m gonna I’m gonna go to bed now but ah on my way to work tomorrow morning I’m gonna stop by around 830.

 Rachel: Good different?
 Rachel: Whoa!! Whoa whoa wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? (Ross can’t answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there when I was in there?!
 Rachel: And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
 Rachel: We were on a break!
 Rachel: You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?
 Rachel: Well you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
 Rachel: God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
 Rachel: Oh that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again.
 Rachel: All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
 Rachel: You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me and been naked with me and made love to me?
 Rachel: You knew that our hot sweaty writhing bodies were....
 Rachel: I’m thinking I’m gonna order a pizza.
 Rachel: Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes I’d like to order a large pizza.
 Rachel: With ah extra anchovies.
 Rachel: Yeah and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
 Rachel: Well I should think so. You slept with someone.
 Rachel: That’s....
 Rachel: That is neither here nor there.
 Rachel: No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?
 Rachel: (softly) I think you should go.
 Rachel: (softly) I really think you need to go now.
 Rachel: Yeah what the hell did I know!
 Rachel: (crying) No. I can’t you’re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never ever hurt me ever. God and now I just can’t stop picturing with her I can’t (Ross stands up and backs away) it doesn’t matter what you say or what you do Ross. It’s just changed everything. Forever.
 Rachel: Then how come it is?
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Okay let me just get a cup of coffee.
 Rachel: Closer than here?

 Rachel: Chandler! You’re smoking? What are you doing?!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: No. Thank you.
 Rachel: Well they never have any paper in there yknow. So my rule is ‘no tissue no tuschy.’ (Phoebe laughs and gets out.) Well if everybody’s going. (She gets out and starts to close the door.)
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: What no no no mine are deceptively small I mean I-I-I actually sometimes st-stuff my bra.

 Rachel: So you know how to fix it?
 Rachel: Great!

 Rachel: No you guys I am not getting in a car with him you’ll have to think of something else.
 Rachel: (all excited) Op op car! Car!! (sees it’s Ross) Ugh!!!
 Rachel: What is he doing here?!
 Rachel: All right!! Fine! Fine.
 Rachel: Ask me what?
 Rachel: You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
 Rachel: Why would you even want to come Ross? You’re a horrible skier.
 Rachel: All right let’s go!
 Rachel: Oh I’m sorry were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
 Rachel: Yknow Ross why don’t you put that on your answering machine!
 Rachel: (to Monica) What?!
 Rachel: Really Joey?
 Rachel: No I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: Well I’m really sick of your smoking so I brought something that is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)
 Rachel: Come on it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since.
 Rachel: (to Ross) What’s your problem?
 Rachel: Ross I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
 Rachel: Oh right ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
 Rachel: Oh yknow what I didn’t want cinnamon on this.
 Rachel: Oh my God!! Great!
 Rachel: Well that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
 Rachel: (laughs) Well I mean are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning y’know what I mean. That wig all in disarray and boobs flung over the night stand yknow.
 Rachel: I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
 Rachel: Monica last Saturday night what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
 Rachel: All right.
 Rachel: Hey how are those tapes working out for ya?
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: Hey Mon let’s give Pete a chance Come on he was funny he seems really nice and that check thing was adorable.
 Rachel: We use it!!
 Rachel: Oh my God Monica’s gonna go out with a millionaire.
 Rachel: Oh my God I can’t believe this is a real $20000 check oh this is just so exciting.
 Rachel: Oh yeah sure that too.
 Rachel: Oh my God! The millionaire’s here!
 Rachel: Hi!!
 Rachel: Just one drink?!
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: Hi! All right let’s go shoppin’!!
 Rachel: Oh okay.
 Rachel: Wow! Umm....
 Rachel: I know.
 Rachel: Well I told him I would think about it but I’m gonna tell him no.
 Rachel: I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming cute guy who’s asking me to go out with him which I’m allowed to do and I felt guilty. Yknow like I’d be cheating on Ross or something.
 Rachel: I don’t have any issues with my Father.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Yeah. Ahh here’s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)
 Rachel: Oh yknow it’s just like hats and a shirt and CD’s just sort of stuff that you’ve left here.
 Rachel: No. Ross it it just seems that yknow it’s time we-we yknow move on. I mean I mean don’t’ you think?
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Good.
 Rachel: Ross you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
 Rachel: Okay all right give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug.
 Rachel: You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
 Rachel: Oh you are a petty man. You are a petty petty....
 Rachel: Petty... (goes into her room)
 Rachel: Petty...
 Rachel: Small...
 Rachel: You are so just doing this out of spite.
 Rachel: Huh?
 Rachel: You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t even fit you anymore!
 Rachel: (imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!
 Rachel: Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing she can be like ‘Where’s number 27?!’
 Rachel: Yknow what?
 Rachel: I can’t do this.
 Rachel: Well oh Mark I’m doing this for the wrong reasons yknow? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry it’s not very fair to you.
 Rachel: Oh God. I’m sorry about this.
 Rachel: You sure?
 Rachel: (entering) Hey!
 Rachel: Oh great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair.
 Rachel: Oh well I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it out it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)
 Rachel: (She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take a deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)
 Rachel: Hey Sophie!
 Rachel: Thanks for lunch Chandler. Yknow you didn’t have to walk me all the way back up here.
 Rachel: Honey um honey you do realise that we don’t keep the women’s lingerie here in the office?
 Rachel: Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)
 Rachel: (introduces them) Joanna this is my friend Chandler Bing (to Chandler) Joanna.
 Rachel: Bye Chandler.
 Rachel: Oh nothing he’s just goofy like that I actually hardly notice it anymore.
 Rachel: No!! No! He’s not married or involved with anyone!
 Rachel: Well I’ll ask him for you if you want me too?
 Rachel: (entering) Hey!
 Rachel: I need to talk to you!
 Rachel: Oh sorry. I meant Chandler.
 Rachel: Okay my boss Joanna when you left she started asking questions about you...
 Rachel: (looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay what do think? Are you interested at all?
 Rachel: Oh thank you Chandler this is so great she’s gonna love me.

 Rachel: (to Chandler) O-o-o-okay how did it go? Tell me everything.
 Rachel: Hmm.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Oh I....
 Rachel: Oh I know...
 Rachel: Ohh gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?
 Rachel: You can’t just say ‘Nice to meet you good night?’
 Rachel: Well they always called.
 Rachel: No. Sorry.
 Rachel: Okay okay. Umm well ah maybe he maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
 Rachel: Well...
 Rachel: No. I...
 Rachel: (grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!
 Rachel: Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out she’s gone crazy!
 Rachel: Come on this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her!
 Rachel: Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.
 Rachel: I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And I don’t care how hard it is for you do not tell her that you will call her again!
 Rachel: That’s fine!
 Rachel: I know.
 Rachel: Sophie’s desk.
 Rachel: (whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
 Rachel: Chandler!!
 Rachel: Okay you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now. (She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)
 Rachel: So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
 Rachel: What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
 Rachel: And you’re still not attracted to him at all?
 Rachel: Yeah but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health teacher.

 Rachel: Now that you’re on you’re own you’re free to look as stupid as you like.
 Rachel: Yeah come here!
 Rachel: Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
 Rachel: (she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle but has trouble opening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as Ross enters.)
 Rachel: (She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!
 Rachel: I’m fine I’m fine.
 Rachel: Yes I am!
 Rachel: Look I’m fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her toes) Look at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin with her hand and almost falls over.) Whoa-whoa!
 Rachel: No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It’s a very big deal there’s a lot of people there I have to meet.
 Rachel: Well I will go to the hospital tomorrow it’ll still be broken then.
 Rachel: But yknow I could use a hand getting ready.
 Rachel: Look either help me or go.
 Rachel: (with a hurt expression on her face) Okay but before you go could you help me first?
 Rachel: (She drops the brush) Yknow what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please help me with this too?
 Rachel: (taking the brush back) Okay. Let’s use this brush. (Hands him another one.)
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Careful. Light. Okay do you know how just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
 Rachel: Oh-ho!

 Rachel: Since when since when do you think I don’t wear enough of this?
 Rachel: Blow it.

 Rachel: (interrupting) Whoa-ho.
 Rachel: I don’t know.
 Rachel: Oh making it worse!
 Rachel: Oh was it awful?
 Rachel: I wrote you a letter.
 Rachel: (handing him the letter) It’s just some things I’ve been thinking about. Some things about us and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
 Rachel: Well I’ll be waiting for you just come up when you’re done.
 Rachel: (coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up and quickly puts the letter back together pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Why didn’t you come up?
 Rachel: You just finished?
 Rachel: So umm does it?
 Rachel: Does it?
 Rachel: What are you talking about Ross you just said that you read it twice! Look yknow what either it does or it doesn’t and if you have to even think about it...
 Rachel: Are you sure?

 Rachel: How was the beach?
 Rachel: Ooh I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?
 Rachel: All right that’s it you guys! What happened out there?
 Rachel: Oh-hooo I missed you.
 Rachel: Ooh I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Yknow?
 Rachel: You have! Ross you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all “Once a cheater always a cheater.”
 Rachel: Ooh I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...

 Rachel: And hey! Just so you know it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
 Rachel: Good! ‘Cause I’ve got a product report to read it’s like eight pages I hope I don’t fall asleep.
 Rachel: (sees Chip’s phone number) Wow! Look at that Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
 Rachel: (interrupting) I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.

 Rachel: Umm when were you gonna tell me that you’re going out with Chip Matthews?
 Rachel: Nooo! It’s not okay! I can’t believe you would want to after what he did to me!
 Rachel: Monica! I couldn’t find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
 Rachel: I mean why of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
 Rachel: Okay that doesn’t help me because we went to the same high school.
 Rachel: (shocked) They had to have that specially made?!
 Rachel: (stunned) Oh my God they told us that was for the mascot!
 Rachel: Oh you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her)
 Rachel: Yeah. Just if it’s possible could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
 Rachel: I believe it.
 Rachel: Yes I do.
 Rachel: Oh sure I am because you always have to be right.
 Rachel: Jurassic Park could happen.
 Rachel: (entering) You guys you’re never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! (She’s holding a flyer.) Look kinda familiar?
 Rachel: You guys there’s a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean you know what that means?!

 Rachel: What did you get her? (Joey opens up a rectangular black box and holds up a pen.)
 Rachel: Okay honey what he means by that is ...while this is a very nice gift maybe its just not something a boyfriend gives?
 Rachel: Any luck?
 Rachel: All right look. Why dont you just return the book let Joey give her the clock pen and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.

 Rachel: Yeah Phoebe you’re… awful!
 Rachel: I know I remember that!
 Rachel: Well Chandler you’re gonna have to tell him.
 Rachel: Because you do.
 Rachel: Phoebe his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: So are things with you and Joey any better?
 Rachel: Oh wow eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
 Rachel: You shouldn’t.
 Rachel: Well I’m gonna take a nap turkey makes me sleepy.
 Rachel: I know but all that work you’re doing to get it ready I just… (goes into her bedroom.)
 Rachel: (standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!
 Rachel: Honey maybe we should take you to a doctor.
 Rachel: Ooh so cute that I’m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
 Rachel: I know it’s sick.
 Rachel: Because it’s Richard’s son! It’s like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
 Rachel: Is he okay in there?
 Rachel: So now what exactly is the point of the box?
 Rachel: (worried) Why?
 Rachel: Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)
 Rachel: (coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
 Rachel: Huh well maybe it uh it changed.
 Rachel: Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
 Rachel: Credit.
 Rachel: Ooh I like those sunglasses.
 Rachel: (Swears in Italian it’s the same term used by Joey earlier and Joey nods his approval.)
 Rachel: Fancy soap? I thought we were savin’ that for the Pope!
 Rachel: (pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.
 Rachel: Ross can you pass me the yams?
 Rachel: Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
 Rachel: Okay fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)
 Rachel: Don’t say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross what’s in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the museum from the first time we… were together. Okay maybe I exchange gifts sometimes but I keep the things that matter!
 Rachel: Joey had reasons.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Oh he sees her!
 Rachel: Hey y’know at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day then my birthday then bang!—before you know it they’re lighting that damn tree again. Ohh I want somebody! (hearing this Gunther moves in) Y’know I want a man!! (Gunther leaves depressed) I mean it doesn’t even have to be a big relationship y’know just like a fling would be great.
 Rachel: Well believe me it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung.
 Rachel: Yeah! Wait a minute it’s been a long time that I’ve been single. How come you never offered this before?
 Rachel: Okay! No accountants. Oh and no one from like legal. I don’t like guys with boring jobs.
 Rachel: Hey honey! What’s the matter? (Monica shows her her hat.) Fine I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
 Rachel: Well wait a minute you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yell at them? Or fire them?
 Rachel: Pheebs that’s great!

 Rachel: Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
 Rachel: Well yknow possibly. (pause) You didn’t tell him that though? Right?
 Rachel: You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!
 Rachel: Oh between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh he’s so gonna get the wrong idea.
 Rachel: Chandler! Patrick just uh ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
 Rachel: You idiot!!
 Rachel: You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
 Rachel: Y’know you should never be allowed to talk to people!
 Rachel: Oh! See just I’m right back where I started! Aww this sucks! Being alone sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
 Rachel: Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)
 Rachel: What?! Chandler what is the matter with you?!
 Rachel: Hey y’know at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day then my birthday then bang!—before you know it they’re lighting that damn tree again. Ohh I want somebody!

 Rachel: But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
 Rachel: Well how can you be a tour guide don’t you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
 Rachel: Honey this really is an incredible thing to do for them but there are things to think about.
 Rachel: Wow! I don’t know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a…keeper.
 Rachel: Yeah honey maybe you can talk to somebody who’s had a baby. Like your mom?
 Rachel: You guys are really right…there aren’t you?
 Rachel: Oh Chandler that is so nice.
 Rachel: Why? Just because you’re not mature enough to understand something like that?!
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Yeah you should really.
 Rachel: Yeah when we’re in the audience he doesn’t talk to us but he does wave.
 Rachel: Yeah not girls anyway guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that.
 Rachel: Let me see that. (Monica shows her) Oh yeah.
 Rachel: Well y’know sometimes that helps. (She realises what that could’ve meant.)
 Rachel: Well if you go to Disneyland you don’t spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
 Rachel: Oo toes!! Well for some people. (Chandler eyes her and her toes.)
 Rachel: Oo I can’t watch this it’s like Sophie’s Choice.
 Rachel: Ooh it was only okay.
 Rachel: It depends on who asked.
 Rachel: Oh Mon sure.
 Rachel: Yes. (Pause) You’re not asking are you?
 Rachel: Yes! Totally!
 Rachel: What the hell is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Is that you? (Monica nods her head no and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.) Ohhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joey’s with Monica in trail.)
 Rachel: (angrily) BACK OFF!!! (She starts banging on their door.) Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up get up get up get up get up!!
 Rachel: What is that noise?
 Rachel: Well I’ve been up since six. Thanks to somebody’s dumb-ass rooster.
 Rachel: Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: I’m so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
 Rachel: How many guesses do you get?
 Rachel: No! There’s no orange juice in there! We win!!
 Rachel: Okay well we won that one.
 Rachel: Yeah and none of these stupid grocery questions real personal questions.
 Rachel: Fine! We’ll ask Phoebe.
 Rachel: I know! I know it’s such a huge life-altering thing.
 Rachel: Tails!
 Rachel: We’ll take Literature!!
 Rachel: Chandler gets it! It’s Chandler Bing!
 Rachel: (shouting) It’s All Relative!!
 Rachel: (shouting) I’m sorry!
 Rachel: Monica I don’t want to lose 200 dollars.
 Rachel: Monica?!
 Rachel: Okay so let’s play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
 Rachel: Oooohh that’s interesting.
 Rachel: Throw in the duck too!
 Rachel: Well he gets the other one all riled up.
 Rachel: Monica betting the apartment I don’t know about this.
 Rachel: Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
 Rachel: All right let’s do it.
 Rachel: Okay. (They go into the living room.)
 Rachel: All right!
 Rachel: 14?
 Rachel: Space cowboy!
 Rachel: Oh gosh it has something to do with numbers.
 Rachel: He carries a briefcase.
 Rachel: Oh-oh-oh he’s a transponce—transpondster!
 Rachel: Oh my God.
 Rachel: (entering from Chandler’s bedroom I guess and sees the foosball table.) Oh my God! I can’t believe you guys are actually think you’re moving in here!
 Rachel: Well I-I-I’m not moving.
 Rachel: No it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
 Rachel: Noooo.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: I don’t care I’m not going anywhere.
 Rachel: No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl’s apartment! That is a boy’s apartment it’s dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It’s-it’s so pretty! And look and it’s-it’s purple! And I’m telling you you with the steady hand I am not moving and now I have got the steady hand. (She holds out her hand which is shaking uncontrollably.)
 Rachel: That’s right! You do what the hand says!
 Rachel: How did it go?
 Rachel: Y’know what you are mean boys who are just being mean!
 Rachel: That is not true. She did! She forced me!
 Rachel: Well it stupid unfair question!
 Rachel: Will you stop calling it your apartment!
 Rachel: No it’s not!
 Rachel: Oh I think I saw some in here.
 Rachel: I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut it’ll die.
 Rachel: Bloomingdale’s eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps)
 Rachel: No but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: (on the phone) Monica I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! (Pause) I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye call me when you get this message. (Hangs up as her boss Mr. Waltham walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham I ah really need to talk to you.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Hi I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
 Rachel: Oh I’m so sorry.
 Rachel: Well at least that’s a great suit.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: No-no that wasn’t me! (To Joshua) Well we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.
 Rachel: Oh-oh sorry it’s this way it’s this way. (Motions to the correct way.)
 Rachel: I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today and I got to dress him up all day!
 Rachel: Oh I wish he was a doll then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name I never realised it Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
 Rachel: Hi-e!!
 Rachel: Well it was just something Josh said about v-necks but you had to be there.

 Rachel: Yeah that’s true.
 Rachel: Chandler what did she say?
 Rachel: Beefsteak Charlie’s?
 Rachel: Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joey’s.) Oh hey do you need help with that?
 Rachel: Ooh I just feel bad I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and Joey’s.)
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: So I was with Joshua for an hour today and he has not asked me out. It’s just so frustrating!
 Rachel: Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?
 Rachel: Hmm-mmm.
 Rachel: Yeah but I’ve never asked a guy out before.
 Rachel: No. Have you?
 Rachel: I don’t even know how I would go about it.
 Rachel: You know what I’m gonna do that I’m gonna call him up and I’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin’? (Calls him) Hi! Joshua?

 Rachel: I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not two tickets I have an extra ticket.
 Rachel: He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got the date I’m just not on it!
 Rachel: Wow! Monica!
 Rachel: Honey this is not your fault just because you guys had a fight it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello Rachel. Hi Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes I just wanted to see you again. Oh I’m glad. Rachel I’d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin’?
 Rachel: How does going to a strip club help him better?
 Rachel: Um-hmm. (Joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves Rachel staring at his ass.) There we go. There it is.
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Oh okay. Uhh well let’s see. (Grabs his hand.) You’re about—well uh this one is large. And this one—(Grabs the other hand.)
 Rachel: Yeah! Okay two larges coming right up!
 Rachel: Yes.
 Rachel: Sure. You got it. Great!
 Rachel: Me Fledermaus great. I really—(motions to Joshua.)
 Rachel: So? (She puts her hands in his totally forgetting about the gloves and hoping for something more intimate.)
 Rachel: Ohh! Right! Right sorry I’ll be right back!
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: No! Nothing!
 Rachel: Yeah! That would be great!
 Rachel: (shocked) Well I-I guess—I…
 Rachel: Yeah great you betcha!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh. Oh right.
 Rachel: Oh yay!
 Rachel: (entering) Hey!
 Rachel: Hey Monica!
 Rachel: Ohh it’s Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So… What are you gonna do?
 Rachel: No! Help me!
 Rachel: Phoebe?
 Rachel: Ugh!
 Rachel: Ohh gosh. You guys come on this is—I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y’know the Wouldn’t it be great if she was my wife Rachel. Ohh all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
 Rachel: Ohh! (Realises that Ross is in the room.) Hi!
 Rachel: So….
 Rachel: Ohhhh come on!!!
 Rachel: No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross please!
 Rachel: I’ll be right there! (to Ross) Okay Ross please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we’ve gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
 Rachel: Oh thank you! Thank you thank you thank you! (Monica opens the door.) Emily?
 Rachel: I’m Rachel Green.
 Rachel: There’s been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I’m not free tonight. So…
 Rachel: Oh well no I…
 Rachel: I’ll get her.
 Rachel: Hey—whoa slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No keep moving. (Joey runs off.) Wow!
 Rachel: Well I didn’t see Joshua last night but I did punch a girl in the face.
 Rachel: The whole night was horrible it was pouring down rain and when I got there there was no Rachel Green on the list but there was a Rachel Greep.
 Rachel: No there is no Rachel Greep but then this other girl overheard us and she was all I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep! and he let her right in.
 Rachel: No she was already in but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
 Rachel: Honey that’s you’re name.
 Rachel: What? Who the hell is Emily—(realises) noooo!!
 Rachel: They’re in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her arms franticly and hits Chandler.)
 Rachel: How—how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hits Chandler again.)
 Rachel: I don’t get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler yet again.)
 Rachel: I don’t care! All right y’know what I’m just upset that I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
 Rachel: Oh y’know would you just for once not remember every…little…thing!! (Storms out.)
 Rachel: (joining them) Well I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t call. I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh you know what makes it so much worse Ross is all happy in Vermont!
 Rachel: (entering) I can’t believe it! He still hasn’t called.
 Rachel: It’s Joshua.
 Rachel: No I don’t.
 Rachel: Yeah come on! What’s going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)
 Rachel: See I don’t know for me it would have to Chantal.
 Rachel: Oh my goodness she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…
 Rachel: Well are we all together? Like in a group?
 Rachel: Oh hey!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh hmm.
 Rachel: Joshua.
 Rachel: Yeah I…
 Rachel: Oh thank goodness!
 Rachel: Oh no problem. I’m so glad I could help. Happy for you. (She playfully punches him.)
 Rachel: No happy for you! (Hits him harder.)
 Rachel: No-no-no that’ not Joshua.
 Rachel: Chandler there’s a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)
 Rachel: Chandler don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a guy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) That does! (Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
 Rachel: Hmm.
 Rachel: Well here’s another question for ya. Uhh do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
 Rachel: Okay good. Now that since you know when you come over would you mind actually using it?
 Rachel: Guess who we ran into today?!
 Rachel: You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
 Rachel: (entering with Joey) Hey!
 Rachel: Y’know you-you also could’ve used uh lamps and then followed the light.
 Rachel: It’s coming from Joey!
 Rachel: Please Ross you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
 Rachel: (starts laughing Ross stares at her) I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You’re right you are a tough guy. You’re the toughest palaeontologist I know.
 Rachel: Oh well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him.
 Rachel: You…are…not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today and guess what happened?
 Rachel: No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
 Rachel: (refers to the table) What are these?
 Rachel: Okay okay okay should I be scared?
 Rachel: Wow! If only more people knew.
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: (noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that weren’t there originally.) What-what are-what are these?
 Rachel: Oh my God! Look at this!
 Rachel: I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!
 Rachel: And did you?!
 Rachel: Oh my God.
 Rachel: Hello Mrs. Chatracus.
 Rachel: Thank God.
 Rachel: Well Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
 Rachel: Oh here’s that trench-coat that you wanted.
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: (stopping him) Oh no-no no-no they don’t want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
 Rachel: Well that’s because of a lot of…(She imitates someone picking their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)
 Rachel: I know!
 Rachel: Oh?
 Rachel: Well congratulations so do you love her?
 Rachel: Huh. Well uh that’s uh that’s interesting. (She goes over and retrieves her note.)
 Rachel: Oh it’s just an anti-theft device.
 Rachel: You need that you need that too ‘cause obviously a thief could just tear this up. (Rips up the note.)
 Rachel: Oops sorry. Listen we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually we have to have one in five minutes so everybody cancel your plans.
 Rachel: We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look he said he’s not ready to date so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)
 Rachel: Surprise!!!
 Rachel: Well it was all Ross’s idea.
 Rachel: Uhh because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh quick he’s looking over here say something funny.
 Rachel: Okay y’know what y’know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She does a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!
 Rachel: Care for a cherry?
 Rachel: No? Y’know I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
 Rachel: Oh could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
 Rachel: Up!
 Rachel: Yeah I did. I needed my lucky dress.
 Rachel: Ohh God! Look at him he’s so cute. I wanna go over there grab him and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: It’s not Christmas!
 Rachel: He’s not 11!
 Rachel: What? You’re leaving?!
 Rachel: No! You guys can’t leave yet! You have to stay we-we got the whole big thing planned!
 Rachel: (spinning the bottle) So Spin the Bottle works like this I spin the bottle it lands on Gunther so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther’s face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?
 Rachel: Yay! Emily!
 Rachel: Okay my turn!!
 Rachel: It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once it’ll kick again!
 Rachel: All right well everybody just remember where they were sitting.
 Rachel: Just a bug.
 Rachel: No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn’t working out to well for me but for four years this baby never missed.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Ohh yeah well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an ‘E!’
 Rachel: Gimme an ‘M!’
 Rachel: Gimme an ‘I!’
 Rachel: Gimme an ‘L!’
 Rachel: Gimme a ‘Y!’
 Rachel: What do you get? (She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) Emil—Whoa!! (She falls in Chandler’s room.) Okay! So that’s me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Gunther’s the only one that claps.)
 Rachel: I’m fine! I’m fine! I’m just losing a tooth it’s no big deal. I have a dentist! Y’know. I’m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. (She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do now?
 Rachel: All right come on let’s go get your coat.
 Rachel: Oh yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Y’know this bra… Really bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Y’know this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here a lot of memories. If these walls could talk y’know what they’d say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently pulling on her bra in order to remove it but it isn’t co-operating.)
 Rachel: Oh no-no-no! No I got this all under control.
 Rachel: Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is this is not how this is supposed to happen.
 Rachel: Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that if I could get you here I could seduce you.
 Rachel: Well I’m sorry I thought you needed them!
 Rachel: Why?!
 Rachel: You like me?
 Rachel: Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God I can’t believe this all this time I liked you and you liked me!
 Rachel: Oh no-no-no don’t say but! No-no but’s never good! Let’s just leave it at you like me and I like you.
 Rachel: Oh now see that’s a fancy but.
 Rachel: But….
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Ohh here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so you and Emily are free to go.
 Rachel: Oh Ross I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
 Rachel: Well if it makes you feel any better I made a fool out of myself.
 Rachel: Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
 Rachel: I’m so sorry.
 Rachel: Well maybe you didn’t want it to end?
 Rachel: You seem to really like her.
 Rachel: Ross that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends asking to hear stories about you looking through Monica’s photo albums I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.
 Rachel: Yeah you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: I don’t know it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: You’re a pathetic loser right?
 Rachel: Sit!
 Rachel: Oh my gosh Joshua!
 Rachel: They’re not true?
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Oh! Oh I love that but.
 Rachel: You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
 Rachel: Okay. (Joshua goes inside and to Chandler.) Every time.
 Rachel: All right y’know what come on do we really have to watch this while we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)
 Rachel: Honey what are you doing? That’s too heavy.
 Rachel: Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh God. (And gives it to Monica right away.)
 Rachel: Is that the heartbeat?
 Rachel: Oh wow! This is so cool.
 Rachel: Well so are-are you sure that there are three?!
 Rachel: What’s that song? It has been in my head all day long.
 Rachel: Y’know who doesn’t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
 Rachel: No he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
 Rachel: Yes!
 Rachel: I’m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. (As she exits Phoebe enters.) Hey Pheebs!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Well so why don’t you just turn it off?
 Rachel: Well what-what ‘cha got there?
 Rachel: Honey you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Well we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised…
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: (interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!
 Rachel: Well well I can up with it!
 Rachel: Well I…
 Rachel: Okay it’s not Relaxi Cab. It’s Relaxicab like taxicab.
 Rachel: Hey Mon if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight which one of these would you want to be wearing. (She’s holding two frilly lace nighties.)
 Rachel: Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal.
 Rachel: What am I making him by the way?
 Rachel: I thought I was making him filet mignon?
 Rachel: Wow I really get crabby when I cook.
 Rachel: Ohh please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So dig in!
 Rachel: (taking a bite) Hmmm!
 Rachel: Oh I know my God this is so—this rice is so—I am so good.
 Rachel: (sees the chick and the duck) Oh yeah I’m sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
 Rachel: Yeah sure okay. Okay.
 Rachel: All gone! So farm birds huh?
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Okay. So can I serve you a little of—What? What? What? (She sees that Joshua isn’t relaxed.)
 Rachel: But they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
 Rachel: Okay y’know would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.
 Rachel: Your parents’?
 Rachel: Ohh.
 Rachel: Yeah that works.
 Rachel: Wow! This place is fabulous!
 Rachel: Whoa-whoa there’s two living rooms? God growing up here this place must’ve been a real babe magnet.
 Rachel: Ohh you should know this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
 Rachel: That sounds like a plan. Umm is there a place I can go freshen up?
 Rachel: Ah.
 Rachel: Hi you!
 Rachel: I know I can do more than cook.
 Rachel: Ohh! It’s so nice to meet you. (She goes over and shakes their hands.) Hello.
 Rachel: Hello.
 Rachel: What? This-this no oh no no-no-no this is not—that’s-that’s not what it is. See see okay I work in fashion see and-and this is a real dress actually. It’s-it’s they’re-they’re wearing it in Milan so part of my job is too wear the clothes and then I see how people respond and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale’s so… And obviously in uh in-in this case (She grabs a pen and paper) I am going to report back USA not ready.
 Rachel: Yes!
 Rachel: Well we were going to do that after—I mean umm next.
 Rachel: Oh yeah well… Yeah no use wasting this baby just lyin’ around the house.
 Rachel: Yes.
 Rachel: Oh yeah. And uh the best part though when the uh waiter spilled water down my back I jumped up and my boob popped out.
 Rachel: No it’s all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod there heads in agreement.)
 Rachel: So?
 Rachel: Huh.
 Rachel: She’s totally right! When we were together you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
 Rachel: Absolutely! Absolutely!
 Rachel: What—yeah—what y’know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
 Rachel: HEY!! Do you have to do that? It’s Saturday!
 Rachel: I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
 Rachel: Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
 Rachel: Monica you don’t even have a bed you sleep in a ball on the floor!
 Rachel: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
 Rachel: (entering) Hey!
 Rachel: So—Hey Pheebs! So how are the elves?
 Rachel: Yeah my mom got my dad’s season tickets in the divorce so she just gave them to me.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Do you guys want these?
 Rachel: Ohh well you got ‘em.
 Rachel: Just give us our apartment back!
 Rachel: Oh come on! We know what these are worth.
 Rachel: You’re bachelor pad?!
 Rachel: Or I’ll give them to my new boyfriend Joshua.
 Rachel: All right okay look what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
 Rachel: Let me finish.
 Rachel: I’m talking about a bet winner takes all.
 Rachel: Oh okay well I think we should let Phoebe decide because she’s the only who’s impartial and she’s so pretty.
 Rachel: What? Shut up! We’re winning!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: All right cut let’s pick again pick again.
 Rachel: Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queen is high!
 Rachel: We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)
 Rachel: All right. We figured you might respond this way so we have a backup offer.
 Rachel: Let us keep the apartment and…
 Rachel: Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Yeah I-I heard. (Pause everyone looks at each other waiting for Rachel’s reaction.) I think it’s great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh I’m so happy for you!
 Rachel: Hey Mon I was just doing the dishes!
 Rachel: Oh! It’s you. (She stops doing the dishes.) Hi.
 Rachel: Yeah yeah I was just about to take a break anyways so…
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Yeah. Yeah. Definitely well it definitely took me by surprise but I’m okay.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Oh that’s sweet.
 Rachel: (breaking the hug) Uhh hang in there?
 Rachel: I mean maybe you didn’t hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
 Rachel: Oh no-no-no no-no-no it has become it has—yeah. Oh no those were four great dates.
 Rachel: Yeah. Oh yeah. And I mean the connection I mean y’know emotionally mentally physically…
 Rachel: I know isn’t it? It’s like I’m right there with Joshua.
 Rachel: You are right there with Emily. And it’s y’know it’s kinda like…. it’s a tie! Well I gotta get I gotta get back to the dishes.
 Rachel: Oh yeah? Fine.
 Rachel: Oh yeah no what’s that?
 Rachel: That would be great!
 Rachel: (to the closed door) Hang in there. You hang in there. (Gives him the raspberry.)
 Rachel: No just singing. (Does a little song.)
 Rachel: (entering) Hi!
 Rachel: Handling it? What do you mean handling it? There’s nothing to handle. Now maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua. Y’know they’re not gonna get married anyway!
 Rachel: Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous! I mean they’re gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off. I’m telling ya you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re dancing at there’s.
 Rachel: Why not?
 Rachel: Nothing.
 Rachel: In a month?
 Rachel: You mean you mean 30 days?
 Rachel: From now?
 Rachel: Well that’s great.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Ohh nothing I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. (Hugs him) See you.
 Rachel: Yeah! (She sits down) Sit!
 Rachel: I’m more than okay I am really really happy! Wanna know why?
 Rachel: ‘Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are I think we are so on the right track! Y’know? I mean I think we are working I think we are clicking. Y’know?
 Rachel: Yeah-yeah y’know if-if there was just like one little area where I—that I think we need—we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we’re just not crazy enough!
 Rachel: Well yeah right y’know what? Yeah you’re right I mean we no we have our fun. Yeah! But if (Grunts uncomprehensively)……I mean I mean like craaaazy! Y’know? Okay all right. This is gonna this is gonna sound y’know a little umm hasty but uh just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
 Rachel: Oh I know I know it’s-it’s so it’s so totally like Whoa! Can we do this? Y’know I mean but I mean it just feels right! Don’t you think? It does! I mean it just feels right don’t you think?
 Rachel: (entering from her bedroom) Well I just called Joshua…
 Rachel: Well I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.
 Rachel: Well uh his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
 Rachel: Yeah maybe but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married but as it turns out I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.
 Rachel: And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
 Rachel: Well yeah y’know how Ross and I were on again off again on again off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road we would be on again.
 Rachel: Yeah well you uh better make it for three.
 Rachel: Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there.
 Rachel: Uh well I think I think he broke up with me.
 Rachel: Well apparently he scares easy.
 Rachel: It’s okay. Sometimes things don’t work out the way you’d thought they would.
 Rachel: (breaking the hug) Oh hey don’t you have to go pick up Emily?
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Yeah! I got my girls.
 Rachel: Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebe’s lap.)
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Y’know I gotta tell ya this really does put in a better mood.
 Rachel: Oh okay! (She goes to answer the door.)
 Rachel: I’m not gonna marry Chandler!
 Rachel: Okay you guys just relax. (She goes over to open the door and as she does she says.) I doooo. (Sees that it’s Joshua not Chandler that knocked on the door.)
 Rachel: Oh wait Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah well that oughta do it.
 Rachel: Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you werent there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are you are!
 Rachel: Hi sure!
 Rachel: I knew.
 Rachel: I did.
 Rachel: Yeah maybe...
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Oh Ross youre so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Ohhh!!!! [looking at something behind Ross]
 Rachel: Oh look at the little cat! [a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross] Look at it!
 Rachel: All right listen missy. If you want this cart youre gonna have to take me with it!
 Rachel: (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?
 Rachel: I could not have done this without you.
 Rachel: (hurt) What?
 Rachel: Hey I was doin great before I found out about you. You think its easy for me to see you with Julie?
 Rachel: Alright fine you go ahead and you do that alright Ross.
 Rachel: Cause I dont need your stupid ship.
 Rachel: Good. (Ross leaves)
 Rachel: Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...
 Rachel: Well neither do I!
 Rachel: (shocked) Oh my God.
 Rachel: Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again Ross no you’re you’re you’re making this too hard.
 Rachel: I don’t know I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look maybe we should take a break.
 Rachel: No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.
 Rachel: Hi. Ohhh you got my message.
 Rachel: So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
 Rachel: (opening the door) Yknow what I want you to leave! Get outta here!
 Rachel: Just get out! Now!!
 Rachel: Okay! All right! How was she?
 Rachel: Was she good?
 Rachel: Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it let’s talk about it!! How was she?
 Rachel: Good different?
 Rachel:  ...the way you owned up to everything it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Yknow?  I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all “Once a cheater always a cheater.”  Ooh I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
 Rachel: You seem to really like her.
 Rachel: Ross that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends asking to hear stories about you looking through Monica’s photo albums I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.
 Rachel: Yeah you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: (entering) Hey guys! What’s up?
 Rachel: What’s this? Is this Ross’s wedding invitation?
 Rachel: Oh no! No you guys! Come on you don’t have to do that! I’m happy for him! I am! I really—I’m-I’m happ—I’ll work on it.

 Rachel: Oh honey I don’t know. I…
 Rachel: No I’ll think about it. Yeah.
 Rachel: Whos this from?
 Rachel: Oh... (opens it and sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.
 Rachel: It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store and I saw this pin in the window and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I cant believe he remembered!
 Rachel: What did you just say?
 Rachel: Oh.... my God.
 Rachel:  (seeing Ross come off the plane with another woman.) Oh my God.
 Rachel: Julie! Julie isnt that great? I mean isnt that just kick- you-in-the-crotch spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
 Rachel:  She didnt hang up either...
 Rachel: (on phone) Ross hi its Rachel. Im just calling to say that um everythings fine and Im really happy for you and your cat...(cut)...I am over you. I am over you and that my friend is what they call closure. (She hangs up and tosses phone in the ice bucket.)
 Rachel: Oh my God. Oh my God Ross no hang up the phone give me the phone Ross give me the phone give me the phone give me the. . . (She jumps the couch and lands on Rosss back finally getting the phone from him. Ross has a confused expression on his face.)
 Rachel: Ohhhhhhhh God. (climbs off his back)
 Rachel: Ohh ohh.
 Rachel: Well basically lately Ive uh Ive uh sort of had feelings for you.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Oh god.
 Rachel: Oh its OK. You were worth the wait and I dont just mean tonight.

 Rachel: I just I feel I-I just...
 Rachel: Yknow I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
 Rachel: And hey! Just so you know it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
 Rachel: Oh my God.
 Rachel: Oh.

Y’know it’s just it’s for the best y’know it is it’s… Y’know plus somebody’s got to stay here with Phoebe! Y’know she’s gonna be pretty big by then and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
 Rachel: I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah see there’s so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
 Rachel: So uh Pheebs honey how are those mood swings coming?
 Rachel: Whoa! Hey-hey you planning on inviting us?
 Rachel: Hormones!
 Rachel: Nooo!
 Rachel: All right fine! You’re not invited to the party we’re gonna have either.
 Rachel: Well umm…
 Rachel: Little village people.
 Rachel: Oh that is so sweet!
 Rachel: Huh. Except Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
 Rachel: Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
 Rachel: Oh and somebody can get those leather pants she’s always wanted!
 Rachel: Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebe’s way.)
 Rachel: No we…
 Rachel: …hormones yeah.
 Rachel: Oh well actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross’s wedding.
 Rachel: It just might be too hard given the history and all that…
 Rachel: Well h-how is this like that?
 Rachel: (starting to cry) I’m-I’m sorry I just thought that…
 Rachel: Good.
 Rachel: What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)
 Rachel: You what?
 Rachel: Okay. It’s okay. We’re gonna be okay. Y’know what? It’s okay. I’m gonna I’m gonna I’m gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
 Rachel: Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!
 Rachel: I don’t know!
 Rachel: I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour.
 Rachel: Well isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
 Rachel: No really. Really Pheebs you’re not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college or yelling at them when they’re bad y’know or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down. Y’know?
 Rachel: And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
 Rachel: And y’know what else oh my God are they gonna love you.
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Who are you saying check too?
 Rachel: Have fun!
 Rachel: Oh I know.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Yeah well I gotta work I’m sorry.
 Rachel: Because I can’t! Ross I told you no. I can’t.
 Rachel: Oh honey! Don’t get up! What do you need?
 Rachel: Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
 Rachel: Okay that is all you.
 Rachel: Oh I don’t know. I guess we have to eat.
 Rachel: I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
 Rachel: (interrupting) Still in love with?!
 Rachel: I’m not in love with Ross!
 Rachel: Phoebe I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because I’m still in love with him! I mean hey y’know I like Ross as much as the next guy y’know? Clearly I have feelings for him but feelings don’t mean love! I mean I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But I have I have continuing feelings of love but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him. Y’know? I-I have sexual feelings for him but I do love him—Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my—why didn’t you tell me?!!
 Rachel: We?!
 Rachel: You all know? Does Ross know?
 Rachel: Oh I can not believe you didn’t tell me!
 Rachel: (depressed) Hi.
 Rachel: Manhattan does not have enough stores.
 Rachel: You can?
 Rachel: Um-hmm.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Ooh is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
 Rachel: I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
 Rachel: I don’t know his uh his hair never really bothered me that much and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: All right.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Ow!
 Rachel: Well I like you less!
 Rachel: Pheebs?
 Rachel: Do you remember where the duck food is?
 Rachel: (enters with a bag packed) Because I’m going to London.
 Rachel: Yeah I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey you take care you don’t have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.)
 Rachel: Yeah I know I know I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
 Rachel: Ohh—Do you think he will?!
 Rachel: Y’know what? No. It’s not over until someone says I do. (Exits)
 Rachel: (Running to the ticket counter) Ooh ooh oohoohooh. (Slightly out of breath) Hi.
 Rachel: (Faking cheerfulness.) Hello. Umm when is your next flight to London?
 Rachel: Ohh good.
 Rachel: Ohh thank you thank you thank you.

 Rachel: Hello. I need to get on the 11 oclock flight.
 Rachel: Okay you know what/ You’re going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.
 Rachel: Sure you know what? Come on we’ll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the engine.
 Rachel: Look If I don’t get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!
 Rachel: All right you know what? I am not leaving here until you call that plane back!! (She pounds her hand on the counter twice. The ticket agent counters by placing the closed sign on the counter and tapping it twice.)
 Rachel: Ohhh.(she rhythmically taps her hands on the magazine on her lap.)
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Oh. I’m sorry. I’m very sorry. Sorry. (She hums and sighs happily.) It’s just I’m ahh I’m kinda excited. I’m ahh going to London to ahh tell this guy that I love him and... (He puts his headphones on to ignore her.)
 Rachel: ...And so then I realized. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua lying to Ross about why I couldn’t come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...
 Rachel: Ehh pardon me?
 Rachel: But he has to know how I feel!
 Rachel: (Sighing) Well I-I think your wrong.
 Rachel: Well I just came...(She touches him near his heart. She’s almost in tears.) I just needed to tell you...(Looking into his eyes. She takes a deep breath.) Congratulations. (He hugs her. She can barely hold back the tears.)
 Rachel: (To the woman sitting in front of her) He-he said Rachel right? Do you think I should go up there?
 Rachel: Mon honey I gotta ask you something.
 Rachel: Ross said my name up there I mean come on I just can’t pretend that didn’t happen can I?
 Rachel: Monica what should I do?

 Rachel: Oh hi!
 Rachel: Hi. Sorry things aren’t working out so well.
 Rachel: Oh yeah! Of course I mean she’s gonna get over this y’know? I mean so you said my name! Y’know you just said it ‘cause you saw me there if you’d have seen a circus freak you would’ve said I take thee circus freak. Y’know it didn’t mean anything it’s just a mistake. It didn’t mean anything. Right?
 Rachel: Right…
 Rachel: (laughs) Y’know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
 Rachel: Get the hell out of there y’know?
 Rachel: Well look at that same thing.
 Rachel: Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! (They both just stare at her.) Okay don’t believe me I know I’m right—do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Hello? Oh Pheebs! (To them) It’s Phoebe!
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Well Ross said my name.
 Rachel: Okay Pheebs y’know what let’s look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time his obsession begins to grow. So then…

 Rachel: Well of course I am! Its not gonna happen to Ross! Hes your brother. (To Chandler) Hes your old college roommate. Ugh it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
 Rachel: Honey come on! You live far away! Youre not related. You lift right out.

 Rachel: You guys! You guys!
 Rachel: It was like this crazy-eyed hairy beast man! He was like a like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
 Rachel: (proud of herself) Yeah I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Please! We did not fog Danny! Whos Danny?
 Rachel: Hi! You might not remember us but we are the girls that fogged you.
 Rachel: Hi! Just so you know we-we didnt mean to fog you we thought you were like a yeti or something.
 Rachel: Hi! Sorry to bother you but I dont think we can accept your acceptance of our apology it just doesnt really seem like you mean it.
 Rachel: Really! What is with that guy? I mean youd forgive me if I fogged you.
 Rachel: Oh my God honey Im so sorry!
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Oh my God! Oh my God look at these pelts!
 Rachel: What? Uhh Phoebe honey honey I know youre quirky and I get a big kick out of it we all do actually but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature fashion!

 Rachel: Well yknow if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
 Rachel: And stop saying that! I hate that!
 Rachel: Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You cant even open up your mind for a second to see if youre wrong! What does that say about you?
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Okay. Okay.
 Rachel: (entering) Hi!
 Rachel: Oh I went to have pizza. With Danny.
 Rachel: That yeti is one smooth talker.
 Rachel: Yeah yknow I-I think Im just gonna hang out in my room.
 Rachel: Come on you guys! Listen if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. Its okay I really… I dont mind.
 Rachel: Ross I…

 Rachel: Dont let him in! Im supposed to be at a regatta gala.
 Rachel: What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
 Rachel: Shoot shoot this is never gonna work! Hes right there!

 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Then you will definitely get him back!
 Rachel: Okay oh heres what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
 Rachel: Well like anything can be sexy. Like umm oh-oh like this dishtowel! (She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) Ooh ooh this feels sooo good against my cheek!

 Rachel: Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie!
 Rachel: A cyborg?! Isnt that like a robot?!
 Rachel: Uh thank you Phoebe. Umm well what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh how the book was so ahead of its time.
 Rachel: Yeah well feminism yes but also the robots.

 Rachel: Monica is this true?
 Rachel: Okay but if it only happened that one time how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
 Rachel: And the video camera?
 Rachel: Oh my god. Ok you guys there’s Danny. Watch. Just watch this. (He walks past the couch to the counter.) See?! Still pretending he’s not interested. Ohh he’s coming over. Just pretend like we don’t know him. We’ve forgotten who he is.
 Rachel: Thanks Mon.
 Rachel: Monica!!!
 Rachel: (Somewhat angrily) Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don’t answer me. (Giggling) I have a date with Danny.
 Rachel: I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
 Rachel: Well you should be this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
 Rachel: No but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
 Rachel: She was kinda stupid. Youre right. All right Im just gonna go on the date. Im gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
 Rachel: So did I. Im really glad Monica asked us out.

 Rachel: Hi!

 Rachel: (entering from her room) Hey!
 Rachel: Hey umm can I ask you guys something?
 Rachel: Uh I dont have any brothers so I dont know but uh did you guys wrestle?
 Rachel: Well I met Dannys sister yesterday and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
 Rachel: Yeah they were very yknow…wrestley. But I guess thats normal?

 Rachel: So?
 Rachel: Oh good point.
 Rachel: (To Joey) Happy New Year Joey!
 Rachel: But your divorce isnt even final yet.
 Rachel: Op look! Claire forgot her glasses! And shes gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend who I hear needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer if you know what Im talking about.
 Rachel: I dont gossip!
 Rachel: Well maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on yknow kinda like a public service it doesnt mean Im a gossip. I mean would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
 Rachel: What? They were like this!
 Rachel: I didn’t! Even when I found out…umm all right well lets just say I found something out something about someone and lets just say shes gonna keep it. (Goes into her room.)
 Rachel: I think theyre very nice.
 Rachel: Awful absolutely awful. (Plus other negative comments from Phoebe and Monica.)
 Rachel: (entering singing) Baddest man in the whole damn town.
 Rachel: Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)
 Rachel: (entering) Joey do you have a minute?
 Rachel: Oh Joey I have such a problem!
 Rachel: Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey I have got to tell you something!
 Rachel: Oh my God its so huge but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
 Rachel: Yes! Yes! Yes you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
 Rachel: What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
 Rachel: I know I know! I just cant keep this one in so I pick up the phone… (Joey in a childish attempt to not hear what Rachel is about to say puts his fingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. Rachel turns and walks out upon seeing that Joeys not gonna listen and as she exits Chandler walks in and sees Joey in his current state.)
 Rachel: That really is something; thats really cool.
 Rachel: Good luck honey!
 Rachel: Hey uh Joey?
 Rachel: Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
 Rachel: Im not gonna tell you but if you found out on your own that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
 Rachel: (quietly) Yeah. Well. (Pause.) Hey uh Joe would mind going over to Chandlers bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Do you know something?
 Rachel: I might know something too.
 Rachel: Oh no I cant tell you until you tell me what you know.
 Rachel: Well then I cant tell you what I know.
 Rachel: All right how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandlers bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know! (Note Kudos to Ms. Aniston on the delivery of that line. She said it very quickly and didnt screw up a word. Try it yourself it aint that easy.)
 Rachel: AND YOU KNOW!!!
 Rachel: Chandler and Monica?!! Oh this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
 Rachel: Ohhh yeah me too.
 Rachel: Come on Joey!!!
 Rachel: I cant believe you would say that!
 Rachel: No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! (She sits next to him on the couch.) Fine I want—I need more details who-who initiated the first kiss?
 Rachel: Is he romantic with her?
 Rachel: Are they in love?
 Rachel: You dont know anything.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Pheebs I don’t think anyones mad about that.
 Rachel: Oh umm yknow I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
 Rachel: (To Monica) Hey!
 Rachel: Whats up?!
 Rachel: Well yeah I do but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Yknow I-I feel that we dont talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
 Rachel: Oh yknow what we don’t have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!

 Rachel: Nothing! You go!
 Rachel: Wow thats uh juicy. Umm (checks watch) yknow what though Mon I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if—are you sure theres just not anything else?
 Rachel: No! (Gets up to leave.) (Under her breath.) If there was I wouldnt tell you.
 Rachel: Ross couldnt fit down the trash chute.
 Rachel: There he is!
 Rachel: Ohh out oh God I dont know why we didnt think to check there!
 Rachel: You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
 Rachel: Yeah! No thats what I was thinking.
 Rachel: Ross! Janice?!
 Rachel: (entering) Okay I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay you go!
 Rachel: Ugh Monica I know about you and Chandler.
 Rachel: I overheard you guys on the phone the other day and you said Ill just tell Rachel that Im doing laundry for a couple of hours. And he said Laundry? Is that my new nickname? And you said No! You know what your nickname is Mr. Big.
 Rachel: Well I wouldnt know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: All right. So youre telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
 Rachel: Sure! Why?
 Rachel: What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! Thats it! Yknow what? Im just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
 Rachel: Hey! Hi!

 Rachel: Joey if you wanna look good why dont you just come down to the store? Ill help you out.
 Rachel: Sure! (Pause) God please take those off!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Well maybe maybe shes with us right now?
 Rachel: Okay now Joey yknow that since youre returning all of this stuff right after the audition youre gonna have to wear underwear?
 Rachel: Okay its missing something. Ooh I know! Umm okay. (Goes and grabs a bag that looks like a purse and shows it to Joey.)
 Rachel: Its not a purse! Its a shoulder bag.
 Rachel: No Joey look. Trust me all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look men carrying the bag.
 Rachel: Exactly! Unisex!
 Rachel: No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
 Rachel: (entering) Joey what are you doing with the bag? Youre audition is not until tomorrow.
 Rachel: Joey yknow you get any mustard on that bag you cant return it.
 Rachel: All right then you owe me $350.
 Rachel: (glaring at him) Joey…
 Rachel: Hey dont listen to them. I think its sexy.
 Rachel: Hi sweetie!

 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Ahhh I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
 Rachel: Ooh Pheebs what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
 Rachel: What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
 Rachel: Honey wait Joey I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it… (Looks for help.)
 Rachel: …I just dont know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
 Rachel: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Im not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag I just—its just there are other bags that are a little less umm (Pause) controversial.
 Rachel: Id say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
 Rachel: Ohh Im gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
 Rachel: Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
 Rachel: Well I never thought Id say this but Im gonna go use Ugly Naked Guys bathroom. (Does so.)
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: OH MY GOD!!!
 Rachel: Phoebe!! Phoebe!! Its okay!! Its okay!!
 Rachel: I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
 Rachel: Yes I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesnt know so you have to stop screaming!!

 Rachel: Nothing! Oh God were just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
 Rachel: Uh-huh doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
 Rachel: Joey! Come here! Come here!
 Rachel: Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
 Rachel: No. Joey she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guys apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. (Joey gasps) Actually we saw them doing it up against the window.
 Rachel: Wh-what do you mean?
 Rachel: Ohhh I-I would enjoy that!
 Rachel: Ehhh no I wanna do Phoebes thing.
 Rachel: You dont have any secrets!
 Rachel: (To Phoebe) So umm how-how are we gonna mess with them?
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Hey Mon what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?

 Rachel: Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
 Rachel: All right honey wed better go if we wanna catch that movie.
 Rachel: Oh Ross honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
 Rachel: Yknow what you should do?
 Rachel: You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm sandwiches. Or uh or my underwear.
 Rachel: (To Ross) See?
 Rachel: Yeah he broke those too.
 Rachel: Hello! (Listens) Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second shes right here! (To Phoebe) Its Chandler.
 Rachel: Are you kidding?!
 Rachel: I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey do they know that we know?
 Rachel: Joey!
 Rachel: Ugh I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
 Rachel: All right. Be sexy.
 Rachel: Oh yeah! (She gasps.) Oh my God! That is our friend! (Monica covers her face.) Its Naked Ross! (Monica turns and buries her face in Chandlers shoulder.)
 Rachel: Show time!
 Rachel: Okay! (She runs to get some.)
 Rachel: (handing her the wine) Okay honey now Im gonna try to listen from right here!
 Rachel: Okay? Whoa wait! (She undoes one button on Phoebes dress.)
 Rachel: Yeah oh wait! (She goes for another one.)
 Rachel: Joey look just look at it this way the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
 Rachel: Okay!
 Rachel: (running from the guys apartment with Joey in tow) Hey whats-whats going on?!
 Rachel: Awww no its okay weve actually known for a while.
 Rachel: Well Ross we were worried about you. We didnt know how you were going to react.
 Rachel: Oh! Oh I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
 Rachel: Aww Joey come here. (She takes his hand.) Look honey I know this must be really really difficult for you and I--Oh Im sorry. Am I hurting you?
 Rachel: Hmm. Look Ross if you want your neighbors to like you why dont you just pay the hundred bucks? The partys gonna cost you way more than that.
 Rachel: Okay I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
 Rachel: And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
 Rachel: Umm Chandler you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monicas head.
 Rachel: Well because she loves you and because you love her.
 Rachel: Hey Chandler dont freak out! Im telling you something you already know! Come on she broke up with Richard because he didnt want to have babies. And shes a woman and shes almost 30 and yknow its Monica.
 Rachel: No youre right you are absolutely right. I mean that makes that makes everything different.
 Rachel: Not unless different means the same.
 Rachel: Hi! Wow! You look you look…big.
 Rachel: Uhhh yeah. But its not obvious why.
 Rachel: Hey! Hey cute jacket!
 Rachel: Oh! Ow! (Joey motions You see what I mean?!)
 Rachel: Whoa! (Laughs) Yknow what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much. (She punches Katie back.)
 Rachel: Ohh and the nicest girlfriend! (She retaliates.)
 Rachel: Ohh youre so sweet! (She kicks Katie in the shin.)
 Rachel: Ohhhh I cannot look at it! (She doesnt move.)
 Rachel: Oh no wait Pheebs I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But Im not sure Chandler?
 Rachel: (looking at the bill) Uhh we still need a tip.
 Rachel: A couple of bucks.
 Rachel: Phoebe I bet somebodys missing that badge.
 Rachel: Hey Joey!
 Rachel: (disgusted at Rosss antics) Ugh!
 Rachel: What?! You say that to kids?!!
 Rachel: Ross honey its a nice couch. Its not a magic couch.
 Rachel: Wait! No thats ridiculous. Come on he lives three blocks away!
 Rachel: Yeah! (She puts on her coat and turns around and sees Ross is expecting her to help.) (Laughing.) Are you kiddin?
 Rachel: (Disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. Much to her amazement she is successful.) Oh. Oh! I can do it!
 Rachel: Ross!
 Rachel: Ross!
 Rachel: Come on I dont really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
 Rachel: (To Ross) Fine! (To the salesman) We went out.
 Rachel: Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
 Rachel: Ross didnt you say that there was an elevator in here?
 Rachel: Okay yknow what? There is no more left left!
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Oh-oh!
 Rachel: Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
 Rachel: (entering) Hey umm do you guys have that tape measure?
 Rachel: (noticing him) Whats up Joey?
 Rachel: Hey! Joey would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
 Rachel: Thanks!
 Rachel: I know.
 Rachel: Whats up Joe?
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: (laughing) What are you saying?
 Rachel: Yknow honey umm as uh as flattered as I am that uh you saw me first uhh I just I-I dont think we should be cranking anything up.
 Rachel: (laughs and pushes the chair back in) Yeah well yknow umm… No honey listen I think its a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them but I think the way you do it is yknow you meet someone become their friend build a foundation then you ask them out on a date. Dont hit on your existing friends!
 Rachel: Yeah. Yeah. Oh but once you find it ohh its so worth the wait.
 Rachel: (entering) Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
 Rachel: Well I brought the next best thing.
 Rachel: Whoa-oh whats-whats that? (Points.)
 Rachel: Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
 Rachel: Okay!
 Rachel: Ross I dont I just dont think its going to fit.
 Rachel: I know me neither! I mean you had a sketch!
 Rachel: Hey! Hows it going? Did you make any new friends?
 Rachel: What?! Why?!
 Rachel: Oh my God Phoebe are you gonna go to jail?!
 Rachel: Good you guys are all here!
 Rachel: Well I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
 Rachel: I know!
 Rachel: Wh-what?!
 Rachel: Anyway Im going to be the coordinator of the womans collection Ill work right under the director its the perfect perfect job for me!
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: O-okay!
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: Ugh horrible! I did the stupidest most embarrassing thing!
 Rachel: No!
 Rachel: Ugh it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well yknow? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like Well yeah! If youve got enough life jackets! (She starts laughing; Chandler and Joey are not amused.) Trust me it was actually it was very funny. Anyway so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
 Rachel: (We see a flashback as Rachel describes what happened.) All right we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me… Yknow maybe he was going to open the door but I totally miss read him and I uhhh… (The flashback shows that she kissed him on the cheek.)
 Rachel: Well I didnt know what else to do!
 Rachel: Thanks Chandler.
 Rachel: I cant believe it! I got a second interview!
 Rachel: What-what wait a minute you dont think thats why he wants me back?
 Rachel: I accidentally kissed him in the interview and now he wants me back yknow of course cause Lets bring the girl back who kisses everybody!
 Rachel: Oh my God! What if he thinks Im the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
 Rachel: Maybe. I-I dont know—Oh God how could I be so stupid?!
 Rachel: Ohh well Im not totally back yet but thank you.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Excuse me?
 Rachel: (stopping him) Wh-whoa! All right okay-okay I see I see whats going on here! Now listen look-look Im sorry if I gave you the wrong impression but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I (He tries to interrupt and tell her about the ink) hey-hey-hey even though I kissed you that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want this job that bad. Good day sir. (She storms out of his office.)
 Rachel: (entering) Ugh you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
 Rachel: Okay-okay that-thats amazing. How did you know that?
 Rachel: Oh. (Realizes.) Ohhhhhhhhh….
 Rachel: Ah first I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
 Rachel: (looks around for the camera) Okay. Umm well first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh for yelling at you.
 Rachel: Now youre probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah (She puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. Rachel then doesnt know where to put her hands.) who did who did not umm yell at you and storm out and I think thats a big mistake and heres why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job I said no. That shows integrity. And I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizes that she said courage twice.) Okay umm now I know I already said courage but yknow you gotta have courage. And umm and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  So she didnt want to sue him.   Dont worry I had to look it up too.} So there you go you got you got (counts them off with her fingers) courage you got integrity you got (Pause) courage again and not litigious. Look Mr…
 Rachel: Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really really want this job and I think I think I would be really good at it.
 Rachel: (gasps) Oh! You are?
 Rachel: Really? Oh thank you! Oh… Oh would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
 Rachel: Okay well then how about a handshake? (She goes to shake his hand but misses and touches his groin.) Oh God Im sorry! Oh God Im sorry! I did not mean to touch that—I mean you there. There. Uhh okay so thank-thank you Im going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh thank you so—Hey! Ill see you Monday! (Exits.)
 Rachel: (laughs) I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
 Rachel: Yeah! Oh by the way thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
 Rachel: (entering from her room) Okay gotta go! Wish me luck!
 Rachel: Uh well yknow what? I dont think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…
 Rachel: Okay guys way to wish me luck!
 Rachel: Well umm that one is pretty but uh I just I just love this fabric (On the other one.) Sorry.
 Rachel: (laughing nervously) Oh what a fun office.
 Rachel: Oh no my dads a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories…(stops and tries to change directions)…about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princesss right to smoke.
 Rachel: …and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
 Rachel: I know! Its like Im being punished for not having this disgusting poisoning habit!
 Rachel: I mean what if this keeps happening? Yknow theyll-theyll be outside smoking making all the decisions and Ill just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air yknow? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us who do you think shes gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
 Rachel: Yeah I can do that.
 Rachel: I would love to!
 Rachel: Oh well its kinda lonely up there so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
 Rachel: Oh great!
 Rachel: Oh thats okay.
 Rachel: Excuse me can I can I bum one of those? (He holds up his pack.) Yknow what actually… (She takes the one hes smoking and heads over to where Nancy and Kim are standing and laughing.) Okay okay okay whats so funny over here?
 Rachel: Oh I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes yknow? Yknow what I mean like dubbies? And I actually I thought to myself Wow those guys are crazy! But no I actually smoke the regular ones all all the time.
 Rachel: Oh me too.
 Rachel: (Laughs) Oh me too.
 Rachel: Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said yknow? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
 Rachel: Thanks!
 Rachel: Well-well thats cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
 Rachel: I did not!
 Rachel: All right fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
 Rachel: No well no its not that bad yknow? I mean yeah my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell I actually feel like I can throw up.
 Rachel: I am so on board! (She throws away her recently lit cigarette.)
 Rachel: Yeah I did but yknow what? I am really really trying to cut back yknow? (Laughs) Good luck Rach.
 Rachel: Well then lets just quit! Well just quit! Lets all quit!
 Rachel: Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
 Rachel: Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! (She grabs their cigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.)
 Rachel: Okay then! (She starts rummaging through the trash to find Kims lighter.)
 Rachel: Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
 Rachel: Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
 Rachel: Well yknow if you if you started smoking again you couldve at least told me! Come on give me one of those! What are we talking about?
 Rachel: Oh wait no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.

 Rachel: Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean its so unexpected! I mean Chandlers birthday is even before mine!
 Rachel: Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
 Rachel: Oh okay not so weird.
 Rachel: I am so proud of Joey I cant believe hes going to be on Law & Order!
 Rachel: No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
 Rachel: Whats going on?
 Rachel: Ross! We broke up two years ago; youve been married since then. I think its okay that we see other people.
 Rachel: Hm-mmm.
 Rachel: Okay yknow what? We dont need her measurements.

 Rachel: Oh what you-you want both of them?
 Rachel: Okay okay okay look just dont freak out but I kinda lost it. I know its in the apartment but I definitely lost it.
 Rachel: Tell her to wear her own earrings.

 Rachel: Because I lose her stuff!
 Rachel: Oh boy I just cant watch. Its too scary!
 Rachel: Oh yeah well you know me babies responsibilities ahhh!!!
 Rachel: Uhh no no it bothered me when he slept with other women.
 Rachel: But yknow I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.

 Rachel: Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
 Rachel: Okay that is the one we already have!

 Rachel: Your sunglasses?!
 Rachel: Honey you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl I dont flirting is the right thing to… (Ross interrupts and shushes her.)
 Rachel: Im sorry.
 Rachel: Okay well Im gonna clear out some of these boxes. (She grabs a couple of the old pizza boxes and exits.)
 Rachel: Hey! Hey! (Stops Caitlin) Hi! Hey-hey-hey Im Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?

Ugh who would buy this?! (Looks for a place to hide it and finds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phone rings.)
 Rachel: Hey! Whats up?!
 Rachel: So all we have is ice?
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Oh. Oh! (Takes a slug of tequila.)
 Rachel: (does Monicas) I know!
 Rachel: What?! We cant do that!
 Rachel: Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!
 Rachel: I dont think hes the one who needs help.
 Rachel: Ugh!
 Rachel: Okay you are crazy! Im sorry but she sounded generally upset! I mean listen! (She hits a button on the machine.)
 Rachel: Noooooooo!
 Rachel: No wait. Wait.
 Rachel: No Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
 Rachel: Yeah well unless we tell him.
 Rachel: Oh maybe thats Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
 Rachel: Right?
 Rachel: Hey! Hi!
 Rachel: Hey! Yknow what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
 Rachel: Okay just a little scared. Whats going on Ross?
 Rachel: What?! What? What happened?!
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: (gasps) Really?!
 Rachel: Because a car backfired?
 Rachel: Well I-I-I dont know how this fits into your whole seizing thing but um Emily called you today.
 Rachel: No she left a message. (He starts for the machine.) (Stopping him.) But it-it kinda got erased. Theres just (Pause) something wrong with your machine.
 Rachel: Well uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh she wants you to call her.
 Rachel: Now that-that was a good thing that I told you right?
 Rachel: Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—Im sorry all right. Because yknow what? She didnt want me—not important. The point is I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. (She starts for the door.) (Stops) Your decision.
 Rachel: Okay no thats not the right decision. Thats not thats not right no Ross-Ross come on! I mean that woman made you miserable! Okay Ross do you really want to get back into that?
 Rachel: Ugh Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
 Rachel: Okay yknow what? Maybe this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
 Rachel: I mean look-look today you escaped (Pause) (Not believing it) death yknow? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
 Rachel: Well there you go!
 Rachel: (laughing) Close call day.
 Rachel: Ohh honey no problem. Okay. (Gets up.)
 Rachel: Oh?
 Rachel: No. (She heads for the door again.)
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: (going out the door) Yeah uh you-you probably need that for stamps right?
 Rachel: (entering) Hey you guys…
 Rachel: Is Monica here?
 Rachel: All right listen umm I just bought something Im not sure shes gonna like it and its gonna seem a little crazy but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
 Rachel: Noo! I wish! Okay you ready?
 Rachel: Okay! (She goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it Ross stares in shock.) Check it out!
 Rachel: Its a its a cat!
 Rachel: Yes it is!
 Rachel: Excuse me! But this is a purebred show-quality Sphinx cat!
 Rachel: Well it was a little extravagant but I a pretty good deal.
 Rachel: A thousand bucks.
 Rachel: All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute it would sit in my lap and purr all day long and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
 Rachel: Ugh! Look you guys Im really excited about this! Okay? I dont care what you think! Im gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. (They both glare at her.) Well what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Oh wow! Congratulations thats quite a waste of time.
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Well its my cat.
 Rachel: Oh yeah I got a cat.
 Rachel: You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmothers cat. I mean its not sweet its not cute I even dragged that little string on the ground and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear I know this sounds crazy but every time this cat hisses at me I know its saying Rachel!
 Rachel: Well I was gonna let you play with it.
 Rachel: (shes wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) I give up you guys I dont know what Im going to do with this thing!
 Rachel: I tried! They wont take her back.
 Rachel: Well they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean what am I going to do get a thousand regular cats?
 Rachel: No Mon thats not the point. Im out a thousand dollars Im all scratched up and Im stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (Storms out.)
 Rachel: Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! (A woman approaches.)
 Rachel: Its not a baby! Its a cat!
 Rachel: Oh no! No! Its actually—its very sweet. Its very sweet. Look! (Goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) Yeah do you want it?
 Rachel: Well so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
 Rachel: Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
 Rachel: Oh terrific! Thatll be $2000.
 Rachel: Okay a thousand.
 Rachel: Well I do but youre just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
 Rachel: (makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) Obviously you know how to haggle so Im not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I dont call the cops because youre robbing me blind! Blind! (Covers her eyes) Just take cat leave the money and run away! Run away! (Uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled) Damnit! (To the cat) Cat cant you at least smile or something?! (The cat hisses at her again it sounds like Rachel) Okay did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
 Rachel: Its not! Im defrosting a chicken. (Pause) Oh I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
 Rachel: Yeah 15 hundred dollars.
 Rachel: Oh yeah there you go. (Hands over the pillow.)
 Rachel: Oh good great! Ill-Ill keep that in mind. (Turns and walks away.)
 Rachel: Phoebe! Its 6 oclock in the morning! Why arent you at Garys?
 Rachel: Phoebe are you okay?
 Rachel: Phoebe honey wanna get some breakfast?
 Rachel: Yeah it is amazing it lasted that long.
 Rachel: No I meant with the dropper over here. (Points at Chandler.)
 Rachel: Well my eye is a little itchy.
 Rachel: Richard? Im not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
 Rachel: Well Im sorry Im not going to an eye doctor!
 Rachel: (flinches) Ross! Come on! Thats all right! Fine--Okay I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
 Rachel: (flinches again) Monica! Come on!
 Rachel: (freaks) Ross! Stop it! Come on!
 Rachel: Chandler!
 Rachel: Just stop it! Come on!
 Rachel: (entering from her bedroom) All right! Lets get this over with! Ugh! (She walks by the table and notices that no one is looking and accidentally on purpose knocks over the open cereal box.) Ohhh! No! Look what I did! (She starts walking through the mess. {Also notice the continuity error in this scene. Note the position of the box and dispersal pattern of the cereal before and after the camera cut.}) Oh I mean look at this mess! I mean were probably gonna have to clean this up! Yknow? Were gonna have to reschedule!
 Rachel: Oh my God! What does that thing do?
 Rachel: All right Im outta here!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: So were done then!
 Rachel: Okay.

 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Okay. Okay!
 Rachel: (really excited) Great!! It was very very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! (He took out that thing they use to look at peoples retinas and looked at Rachels when she was shaking his hand causing her to flinch and scream at him.)
 Rachel: Yeah no I dont-I dont put things in my eye.
 Rachel: Great!
 Rachel: Okay just give me the damn drops! (Grabs them and storms out.)
 Rachel: Yknow I-I gotta tell ya those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
 Rachel: Damn!
 Rachel: Bye you guys!
 Rachel: Oh honey Ill say good-bye to you at the car if you dont mind the puss.
 Rachel: Well wait a minute! The puss is good! It means its healing! (Runs after him.)
 Rachel: Oh did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
 Rachel: Eh! Stop it!
 Rachel: Okay. (She tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. The only problem is its not over her eye.)
 Rachel: Okay then yknow what? Help me! I need help! I cant do this!
 Rachel: All right!
 Rachel: All right.
 Rachel: Yes!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Okay they are. (No theyre not.)
 Rachel: (thinks) Four.
 Rachel: Really?!
 Rachel: Okay!
 Rachel: Great!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Well well you said it was practice!
 Rachel: Because I knew you were lying!
 Rachel: (as shes being dragged) What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it! (Monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)
 Rachel: Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
 Rachel: Monica! Stop it!
 Rachel: Wow yknow if Joey and Chandler walked in right now we could make a fortune! (Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risqu� pose at least for primetime TV.)
 Rachel: Yep!
 Rachel: What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
 Rachel: Oh! (Shes trying to recover while still on the floor.)
 Rachel: Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
 Rachel: No! No! Its just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
 Rachel: (under her breath) Sucker!
 Rachel: (entering with Ross) Hi!
 Rachel: Well I guess I could take a couple days off work.
 Rachel: Oh no wait a minute wait Ive got a presentation tomorrow. I cant miss that.
 Rachel: That sounds great.
 Rachel: Okay. Yeah that would be nice actually to have the apartment to myself for a night.
 Rachel: No! So I can be by myself. Yknow? Have a little alone time.
 Rachel: No! Phoebe just because Im alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean you live alone you dont walk around naked.
 Rachel: (takes off her robe) Oh! Look what happened! {Dont get your hopes up guys we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franzs butt.} (In her head.) Huh check me out! Im in my kitchen…naked! Im picking up an orange. (Does so) Im naked! (Goes into the living room) Lighting the candles naked and carefully. (She backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her body away.)
 Rachel: (singing) Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! (Theres a knock on the door she turns off the music puts on her robe and goes to answer the door.) Love to love ya baby! (Theres another knock.) Darnit! (Looks through the peephole and turns on the lights.) Ugh. (She opens the door to Ross whos leaning against the door jam.)
 Rachel: Uh yeah if you want too.
 Rachel: Yeah sure?
 Rachel: And um what-what is that Ross?
 Rachel: (laughs) What?! Are you crazy?
 Rachel: (gasps) Oh God you saw me?! Oh!
 Rachel: Noo!! No! You thought you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
 Rachel: Ohh wow! I’m sorry but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
 Rachel: Yes of course absolutely! Youre right. Im sorry.
 Rachel: Yes.
 Rachel: Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm do-do we still need to uh settle the question of us?
 Rachel: (taking off her sweater) Okay umm Ross? Im-Im really warm so Im going to be taking off my sweater. Now Im just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
 Rachel: Im sorry. Im done. Im done.
 Rachel: No not really. I mean youve seen me naked hundreds of times.
 Rachel: Okay. All right thats true! But yknow I just dont embarrass that easily.
 Rachel: No I dont! Ross I think Im just a more secure person than you are.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Yeah all right. All right! Just keep walkin! All right?
 Rachel: Ross! What are you… Im sorry sir. I just I think he just really likes you.
 Rachel: (to the flight attendant who appears in record time. It was only seconds after Rachel pushed the call button was she there. Once again more proof that TV isnt real IRL she wouldve been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then Rosss pants would be dry.) Hi!
 Rachel: Yes Im sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm my friend seems to have had a little accident.
 Rachel: Yes I did. Thank you very much it was excellent. (Disembarks)
 Rachel: Ahh.
 Rachel: Hello! (She makes a face and the kid laughs harder. Finally his parents drag him off.) Ohh kids love me.
 Rachel: Hi! (Hugs Phoebe)
 Rachel: Pancho Vila?
 Rachel: What are you talking about Pheebs? (Takes out her compact) I dont… (She gasps when she looks in the mirror and sees her face.) (To Ross) Oh my God you drew on me?!
 Rachel: Ross I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can—you have so crossed a line. (Heads for the bathroom)
 Rachel: (returning with her purse covering her face) All right it wont come off!
 Rachel: It wont come off!
 Rachel: No actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
 Rachel: Hi!!
 Rachel: Hi. (She hugs Joey.)
 Rachel: What?! What else did he say?
 Rachel: Ross no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
 Rachel: Ross I am a human doodle!!
 Rachel: Okay I need a I need a drink! (Makes a beeline for the mini-bar.)
 Rachel: (shes finished reliving the fridge of its entire alcohol content.) Macadamia nut?
 Rachel: Hm-mmm! (Opens the container)
 Rachel: Nope! (She puts one in her mouth and spits it out then does it again in another direction.)
 Rachel: Oh my God Im starting to look like my great aunt Muriel.
 Rachel: Hit me!
 Rachel: I bet 20.
 Rachel: Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (She slows down with each one.)
 Rachel: Yeah and also we need more umm drinks. Hold on a second. (Gets up but stumbles a little bit.) Whup okay. (She makes it to the phone and picks it up without dialing.) Hello! Vegas?

 Rachel: Ohh I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck! (Goes and hugs Joey.)

 Rachel: I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
 Rachel: Really?!
 Rachel: Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
 Rachel: Ohh I mean we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.
 Rachel: (To Ross) I don’t know. (To the gang.) What do you mean last night? Nothing nothing uh happened last night.
 Rachel: (gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)
 Rachel: No we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous!
 Rachel: Oh my God.
 Rachel: No!
 Rachel: Well I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)
 Rachel: Hey hubby!
 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: Okay! So we’ll just stay married.
 Rachel: And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
 Rachel: Okay see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think you’re kidding.
 Rachel: What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!
 Rachel: Ohh okay I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We absolutely can stay married because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right look just please take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me.
 Rachel: You are asking me to be your wife!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: (thinks about it for a second) No! Ross come on! No! Listen look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line Ross is we can not stay married.
 Rachel: Oh b-b-but it is!
 Rachel: Oh Ross come on! This is not this is not a marriage!! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross listen if you do not get this annulment I will!
 Rachel: Thank you. (He goes to leave.) Hey-hey umm uh is there is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
 Rachel: Huh that’s funny. You look like you’re gonna be the…

 Rachel: Hey so did everything go all right with the annulment?
 Rachel: Ross thank you. Hey do you guys wanna go see a movie?
 Rachel: Pheebs?

 Rachel: Hey so did everything go okay with the annulment?
 Rachel: Ross thank you. Hey do you guys wanna go see a movie?
 Rachel: Okay umm I’m gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)
 Rachel: Oh? Yeah! Sure!
 Rachel: Oh but Phoebe we’re gonna be late for the movie.
 Rachel: Yeah we’re we’re actually just gonna walk ‘cause it’s right up there at the Angelica.
 Rachel: (to the driver) Okay stop-stop! Phoebe?!
 Rachel: What was that?!
 Rachel: I haven’t seen it yet!
 Rachel: Noooooooo!!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Ugh the worse day! Y’know you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
 Rachel: I believe you. So it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys!
 Rachel: And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
 Rachel: And Chandler you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late.
 Rachel: Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God… (Gasps and starts to sing) Come and knock on my door…
 Rachel: (entering) Hey roomie!
 Rachel: (gasps) Are you pregnant?!
 Rachel: Um-hmm.
 Rachel: (laughs) Oh my God! Oh that’s funny I can’t believe I did that.
 Rachel: Okay. (Sits back and resumes her reading.)
 Rachel: Sure? (Monica hands her one.) Thanks.
 Rachel: Monica where did you get these?!
 Rachel: Ooh good God they’re so yummy! (She re-ingests the previously expelled cookie matter from the tissue.)
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Okay!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: (grabbing the star) What the hell is that?
 Rachel: Wow! Mon thanks! I love this plate!
 Rachel: Mon honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time.
 Rachel: Are you okay? You’re not blinking.
 Rachel: Oh all right. But y’know I gotta say I don’t I don’t think six years counts as an era.
 Rachel: What is the matter with you?!
 Rachel: All right fine but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just a little hard to believe.
 Rachel: Well y’know it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y’know? I mean you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m sorry.
 Rachel: But I…
 Rachel: It is? Really?
 Rachel: (starting to lose her composure) I mean we’re not we’re not gonna live together anymore?
 Rachel: What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much! (Starts to cry.)
 Rachel: I mean it’s the end of an era!
 Rachel: Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: (entering from her room) Pheebs I wanna ask you something.
 Rachel: Well since I’m movin’ out and-and you’re so beautiful…
 Rachel: …how about I move in with you?
 Rachel: You have a roommate?!
 Rachel: Oh that’s true.
 Rachel: Yeah yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place.
 Rachel: Pheebs I have to ask you…
 Rachel: You’re just staring into space.
 Rachel: This one? (Picks it up.)
 Rachel: Pheebs this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean look at this; (Points to one and starts to read it.) Wanted. Female roommate non-smoker non-ugly. It’s just there is nothing! The city’s full!
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Yeah! Why?
 Rachel: That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love Warren! Thank you!
 Rachel: Oh this is great! I am gonna call him right now! (Jumps up.) Oh thank you!
 Rachel: (returning from calling Warren) Ugh!!! Well the apartment is already subletted! I mean this is just hopeless. I’m never gonna find anything.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Oh my God! Are you serious?!
 Rachel: I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank you!
 Rachel: Ross-Ross you have no idea what this means to me! I mean I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!
 Rachel: Oh I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! (Kisses him on the cheek and exits.)
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Oh thanks but listen I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.
 Rachel: No-no they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
 Rachel: Yeah I feel kinda bad for them but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here!
 Rachel: No-no I’m staying put.
 Rachel: Why where are you going?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Oh wow.
 Rachel: Yeah. Y’know umm uh umm about that umm Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything but don’t you think it’s gonna be weird?
 Rachel: Well because of us! Because of our history.
 Rachel: No?
 Rachel: No! Not at all!
 Rachel: Okay but Ross eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
 Rachel: Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend you’re gonna have a girlfriend…
 Rachel: But y’know what if you think it’s gonna be okay we’ll just work out a system. Y’know it’ll be like college I’ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign Come back later I’m gettin’ lucky. (Laughs.)
 Rachel: Umm well let’s see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
 Rachel: No the other thing. I really think it’s great they work things out.
 Rachel: Hey can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
 Rachel: Thank you. (Gets up) Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy there’s no turning back.
 Rachel: All right well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later.
 Rachel: Well it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.
 Rachel: So which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
 Rachel: And?
 Rachel: Look at that!
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: No-no I bought those.
 Rachel: Yeah. (Rachel walks away.)
 Rachel: Well who wouldn’t?!
 Rachel: And Mrs.?!
 Rachel: What?!!
 Rachel: Ohh! Oh God! (Laughs her way into the living room.)
 Rachel: Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?
 Rachel: Ross hey you know what might make it less boring?
 Rachel: Some uh some visual aides.
 Rachel: Hey Pheebs you’re still alive! How are you doing?
 Rachel: Pheebs what-what are you doing?
 Rachel: Oh yeah scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you forever. Pheebs you lie down?
 Rachel: Monica!
 Rachel: Did-did you take these back?
 Rachel: Oh yeah they’re really great! Aren’t they?
 Rachel: Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Wow that’s great Ross I’m sorry we weren’t more supportive before.

 Rachel: Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
 Rachel: Really? Really?!
 Rachel: Okay! (Picks up the phone and starts dialing.) (In an Irish accent) Hello Ross this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University we’d like you to come on board with us full time! (Hangs up.)
 Rachel: Hey!

 Rachel: So I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross’s and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
 Rachel: Well maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
 Rachel: Well there’s an idea!!
 Rachel: That would be great! Wait how long is Denise gone for?
 Rachel: December 26th huh maybe she’s Santa Clause.
 Rachel: (deadpan) Oh look who it is my husband. The apple of my eye.
 Rachel: Well sure if you say you’re gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! (Grabs them from him.) All right now I’m gonna do this my way and I don’t want to hear a peep out of you!
 Rachel: Op! You’re peeping!

 Rachel: (to the judge) Okay do you see do you see what you’re keeping me married too?!
 Rachel: All right look lady here is the deal I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
 Rachel: And thank you for your time. (They both beat a hasty retreat.)
 Rachel: This is totally your fault!
 Rachel: Well you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!
 Rachel: Don’t call us that! (Storms away)
 Rachel: (deadpan) Oh honey thank God you’re home I was getting worried.
 Rachel: Oh little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything!
 Rachel: Oh name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
 Rachel: Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
 Rachel: Nothing. (Sits down.)
 Rachel: Uh-hmm. (Just as Rachel finishes signing her name Ross yanks each page out of the way.)
 Rachel: Okay Ross we’re—wait a minute. Umm I uh I kinda have a little confession.
 Rachel: Well y’know this whole marriage thing kinda my idea.
 Rachel: Well remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
 Rachel: And uh yeah I didn’t really I didn’t want to say anything but it kinda it just it kinda kept coming back to me and umm remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a as a compromise we decided first to get married and then (Ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes. So umm sorry I got us into this mess.
 Rachel: Yeah don’t push it though.
 Rachel: I know. I always thought if you and I got married it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn’t be a secret and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. (They both laugh.)
 Rachel: No it was on the house it was it was a newlywed special.
 Rachel: Hey thanks Ross for taking care of all of this.
 Rachel: I’m gonna need a copy of those.
 Rachel: (entering from her room) Pheebs I was wondering…
 Rachel: Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
 Rachel: Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
 Rachel: Yeah yeah I know.
 Rachel: Surprise!!
 Rachel: No no don’t get mad because look—this is what happened. So I-I started packing then I realized What am I doing? I am lousy at packing! Right? But you love packing! So as a gift to you on our last night ta-da!
 Rachel: Ohhhhhh look it’s the roller blades.
 Rachel: You remember when we got these?
 Rachel: I guess you weren’t there. (They hug.)
 Rachel: I’m sorry Pheebs I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.
 Rachel: I have one.
 Rachel: Uh well I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen. (Laughs. Monica lags behind the laugh a little bit.)
 Rachel: You get your messages!
 Rachel: So-so you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
 Rachel: Ooh your brother. Score!
 Rachel: You know what else I’m not gonna miss? I’m Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!
 Rachel: I’m Monica I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!
 Rachel: Oh my God I can’t find a boyfriend! So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!
 Rachel: I’m unpacking!
 Rachel: I’m not moving! (She re-hangs a picture crookedly.) Is that picture straight?
 Rachel: Hey y’know what? You’re the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
 Rachel: Well it’s mine too! What else you got?!
 Rachel: Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! (She knocks over Monica grabs a box and runs into the kitchen.)
 Rachel: Great! Monica’s moving!
 Rachel: Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (Monica starts chasing Rachel around the table.)
 Rachel: Yeah I’m just mad!
 Rachel: Funny because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
 Rachel: Well Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
 Rachel: Oh really? Like what Monica?
 Rachel: Oh yeah good start Mon.
 Rachel: Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet.
 Rachel: Yeah I do. I-I do do that.
 Rachel: Well y’know I don’t want you to be cold.
 Rachel: Oh it’s gonna be fine.
 Rachel: But honey I think she’s moving in with Chandler.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Oh! I have your key. Here you go. (Hands it to Monica.)
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Oh God! This is silly I’m gonna see you in a couple of hours! (They hug again.)
 Rachel: Bye house!
 Rachel: Bye Mon.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Hi...
 Rachel: Rachel...
 Rachel: Phoebe’s...
 Rachel: leave...
 Rachel: Wait I-I just said leave.
 Rachel: Phoebe come on thats silly.
 Rachel: No I have all of the good words. OK fine fine we can switch.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Everybody…
 Rachel: Rachel…
 Rachel: Phoebe’s…
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Phoebe come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why dont you come with me?!
 Rachel: Yeah itll be fun. Well run in the park. Itll be like our first y’know roommate bonding thing.
 Rachel: Yeah and theres really cute guys there.
 Rachel: OK!
 Rachel: Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
 Rachel: Okay. (Runs off.)
 Rachel: You guys Im telling you when she runs she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
 Rachel: Oh! I used to do that too!
 Rachel: Aw Mon...(Kisses her on the cheek)
 Rachel: Yeah yeah and you know what I know shes gonna wanna run again I just dont know how to get out of it I mean I live with her.
 Rachel: Youre right youre right. I should just tell her the truth.
 Rachel: Pheebs Monica tripped me I dont think I can ever run again ever!
 Rachel: Ankle.
 Rachel: No no Phoebe no I was...no. You know what I was I was actually just checking to see if I could run. And I can!
 Rachel: No wait Phoebe.
 Rachel: Hey Phoebe can I talk to you for a second?
 Rachel: Okay um I...(Phoebe walks into her room.) All right Phoebe look I just wanted to say that Im sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
 Rachel: Well I-I shouldve told you the truth.
 Rachel: Well yknow the reason I didnt wanna go running with you is because um well yknow the way that you run is a little...(Starts flapping her arms)
 Rachel: Well its embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
 Rachel: Because theyre people.
 Rachel: Yes but still. Theyre people…with eyes.
 Rachel: I-I am not uptight—Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen I am not uptight man.
 Rachel: (Runs into Phoebe.) Hey!
 Rachel: Oh honey Im so sorry you were right this feels great!
 Rachel: Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. (Turns and bumps into a mounted policeman and falls) Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry! (Runs off.)
 Rachel: Ohh are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Well sure but they might think it’s kinda weird considering I don’t work there anymore.
 Rachel: I-I got a job at Ralph Lauren.
 Rachel: Yeah. (chuckling) A year ago..
 Rachel: But Pheebs you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn’t like me very much.
 Rachel: Sure.
 Rachel: Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
 Rachel: What? What!?! You kissed him?
 Rachel: (Gasps) Phoebe are you serious?
 Rachel: Phoebe I mean you do know he’s married?
 Rachel: Phoebe…
 Rachel: Oh Kim Hi. (Kim doesn’t even look up from her report.)
 Rachel: So you know I…I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
 Rachel: Ahh….So…Wow…The spring line it’s really going to be great this year huh?
 Rachel: So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room. (Kim stops the elevator and turns to Rachel.)
 Rachel: Yeah. Your teeth? Yes I saw them from outside. (Sitting down on the couch.) You guys are never going to believe this. But Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
 Rachel: Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just…made out. And the craziest thing is now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.
 Rachel: That-that is your make out buddy. Don’t you recognize him? (Holding up the magazine in front of her face.) Oh wait. Ohh Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh My God Phoebe that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copy guy.
 Rachel: Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
 Rachel: To get you to make out with him!!!
 Rachel: Ohh hi Kim.
 Rachel: Yeah remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn’t happen.
 Rachel: Okay two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well it turns out that’s not true.
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: Oh no no no. Oh God you think I made out with him.
 Rachel: I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my keycard. (The elevator stops. Ralph steps on.)
 Rachel: Now she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
 Rachel: I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
 Rachel: You were with Kenny today weren’t you?
 Rachel: Ohh Phoebe what am I going to do?
 Rachel: I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean I could but I wouldn’t.
 Rachel: That wouldn’t help me.
 Rachel: Kim hi.
 Rachel: Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
 Rachel: (Faking crying.) Yeah he dumped me. He said Rachel I can’t do this. Even though you are a very very very beautiful women. I can’t do this. I’m married and I’m sorry. And then I don’t know why but he said and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine.
 Rachel: Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.
 Rachel: You and Ralph?
 Rachel: Hey! Hey Pheebs check it out. Yeah for my desert I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
 Rachel: (worried) Nothing?
 Rachel: So if-if I mess this up there’s nothing else for dessert?
 Rachel: Wow Monica I love that you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question how do you know when uh the butter’s done?
 Rachel: Her dancer friends?
 Rachel: Really?!
 Rachel: I dunno. Y’know to me he’ll always be “Jack Geller walks in while you’re changing.”
 Rachel: (looking at her truffle) Look at it isn’t it beautiful?
 Rachel: It’s a truffle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers then a layer of jam then custard which I made from scratch [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries more ladyfingers then beef sauteed with peas and onions [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then a little more custard and then bananas and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
 Rachel: The beef? Yeah that was weird to me too. But then y’know I thought “well there’s mincemeat pie” I mean that’s an English dessert these people just put very strange things in their food y’know. [To Joey] Oh! by the way can I borrow some Rum from your place?
 Rachel: (teasingly) And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste.
 Rachel: Joey God your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
 Rachel: No!
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: (sarcastically) No I did but tell me again because it’s so romantic.
 Rachel: Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybodys gonna be like “Oh remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”
 Rachel: So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it alright?
 Rachel: Okay...
 Rachel: What’s up Ross?
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Oh no. No Ross don’t do this.
 Rachel: I just- I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea.
 Rachel: I thought this might happen today. Ross I know the holidays can be rough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
 Rachel: No I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you’re [pity-tone] alone alone. And I just-it’s just not the time for us. I’m sorry.
 Rachel: Joey you’re gonna have to stop rushing me you know what? You don’t get any dessert.
 Rachel: No I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay everybody it’s trifle time!
 Rachel: It sure is.
 Rachel: Beef.
 Rachel: Alright Monica I want you to have the first taste.
 Rachel: Oh oh oh wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
 Rachel: Op! Wait you dropped a pea.
 Rachel: Well?
 Rachel: Really? How good?
 Rachel: Okay now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
 Rachel: ...So a bird just grabbed it and then tried to fly away with it and and then just dropped it on the street?
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe do I wanna hear this?
 Rachel: (humoring Phoebe) Oh my God he dream-cheated on you!
 Rachel: (reading the recipe magazine finally figuring out that...) I wasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle!
 Rachel: You guys! It was bananas cream and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!
 Rachel: That’s a good story Grandpa.
 Rachel: So pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
 Rachel: Well I used to date him but you’re still going out with her!
 Rachel: Yeah but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah honey I’m sorry but I don’t think that was a romantic thing.
 Rachel: Well that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
 Rachel: Okay you look in the kitchen I will look in the back closet.
 Rachel: We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
 Rachel: Don’t worry we’re just gonna search here for an hour them we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search OK?
 Rachel: Chandler aren’t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
 Rachel: Chandler that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present two medium presents and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
 Rachel: That’s right!
 Rachel: Oh it’s a Macy’s bag!
 Rachel: (Reading) Dear losers do you really think I’d hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler I knew they’d break you.
 Rachel: We are so gonna find them this year.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Yeah we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
 Rachel: Well Chandler what is this very weird metal A Z thing?
 Rachel: Ha!
 Rachel: Yes okay oh by the way I just gotta say I think its really nice of you that even after youve moved you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
 Rachel: Hey this is hollow.
 Rachel: This bench it’s hollow! I can’t believe I never knew that! (She pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up) Oh the presents!!!
 Rachel: Oh this one’s for me!
 Rachel: Ooh let’s open them!
 Rachel: Whatever Linus I’m opening mine.
 Rachel: Uh wait so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
 Rachel: ‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then!
 Rachel: Yeah. Don’t do this to yourself.
 Rachel: I know.
 Rachel: Oh-oh Pottery Barn! (Grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds the rest back out to Chandler.) You can throw the rest away.
 Rachel: Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Shows her the picture.)
 Rachel: Yeah! It’s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
 Rachel: Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
 Rachel: Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
 Rachel: Okay fine! I’ll-I’ll just tell her it’s an antique apothecary table she doesn’t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Guess!
 Rachel: Ha! See I knew I knew you’d get it on the first guess. Isn’t it cool! It’s an apothecary table.
 Rachel: Ohh yes.
 Rachel: Almost.
 Rachel: It was only 500 bucks.
 Rachel: Oh okay see I thought I thought you meant how much was it when it was new y’know like back then.
 Rachel: Yeah no I mean it was at a flea market so it was y’know it was like a dollar.
 Rachel: And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Uh it’s from yore. Like the days of yore. Y’know?
 Rachel: Yes! That I know this is from White Plains.
 Rachel: Hey! We’re here!
 Rachel: (seeing his new table) Ohh! Oh my God!
 Rachel: Oh no!
 Rachel: Ross! Phoebe’s gonna be here any second she cannot see this!
 Rachel: I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she’s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
 Rachel: Because she hates Pottery Barn.
 Rachel: I know! I know she says it’s all mass-produced nothing is authentic and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (Ross looks at his table.) So come on she’s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
 Rachel: Ooo! Oh I forgot they made sheets!
 Rachel: Ross get over it! It’s not like she hates you.
 Rachel: Ross she’s not weird she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Ooh Phoebe’s here! Okay let’s turn out all the lights and we’ll just watch the movie!
 Rachel: He got it a flea market!
 Rachel: That’s funny. (Phoebe puts her feet up on Ross’s table.)
 Rachel: Ohh!!
 Rachel: Noooooo!! (Phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact same apothecary table they have.)
 Rachel: Oh my God Phoebe Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
 Rachel: Oh yes.
 Rachel: …see I can’t decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair the Sahara desk or the Parker console table.
 Rachel: I know I know. I went a little crazy.
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Oh it does it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
 Rachel: Well there’s yore. And uh y’know yesteryear.
 Rachel: Oh honey he doesn’t need my help.
 Rachel: (not sure of what to do) Y’know what? I don’t I don’t think Phoebe really wants to come.
 Rachel: Oh she does want to.
 Rachel: Pheebs I don’t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Yeah y’know what? Don’t look at it. (Realizes the display is their living room) Seriously don’t look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)
 Rachel: Ugh those bastards! Let’s go.
 Rachel: No! No! No! No it’s not! No it’s not! Come on! Phoebe ours is totally different! I mean we don’t have the… (Looks desperately for something different.) We don’t have the…that lamp! And-and that screen is y’know on the other side.
 Rachel: Okay! Okay-okay look—no I did I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just… Come on don’t be mad.
 Rachel: Well then honey buy the lamp! Hey we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
 Rachel: What?! No! I’m not gonna move out!
 Rachel: (gets it) Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
 Rachel: That’s right!
 Rachel: I’m sorry I was just reading the joke below it. Man that one is funny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)
 Rachel: We are looking at a Playboy.
 Rachel: Oh yeah sure. I mean like in the case of this young woman she has lost her clothes so she rides naked on the horse she’s crying out ‘Where are they where are they?’
 Rachel: You see now I would date this girl. She’s cute she’s outdoorsy you know and she knows how to build a fire. I mean that’s got to come in handy
 Rachel: (thinks) I don’t know.
 Rachel: Monica what are you doing?
 Rachel: (To Monica) Well people are different.
 Rachel: What? Wait a minute. What are you saying that I’m a pushover? I’m not a pushover.
 Rachel: Oh my … you think I’m a pushover. Well wait watch this you know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that’s pretty strong that’s what I think. Come on Monica let’s go to lunch. (She leaves)
 Rachel: I cannot believe her.
 Rachel: Oh oh I love that Japanese place.
 Rachel: All right wherever you wanna go is cool.
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: Joey honey I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.
 Rachel: Come on Joey I did it and it was fine.
 Rachel: Well you know what? This is great. Finally I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a long way. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
 Rachel: Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
 Rachel: Yes we are very sorry to tell you this but you Phoebe are flaky.
 Rachel: So what you’re just you’re just okay with being flaky?
 Rachel: Yeah and I am okay with being a pushover.
 Rachel: I am not a pushover!
 Rachel: Wow you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever heard.
 Rachel: How-how did you lose your job here?
 Rachel: He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not that’s not right.
 Rachel: Joey you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what I’m not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No I really shouldn’t say anything—No I should say something to him. (Goes to the counter) Gunther I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him…
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: That’s right he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go Joey you got your job back.
 Rachel: Yeah pretty nice huh? Now who’s a pushover?
 Rachel: Oh I’m sorry. (Gets up and moves.)
 Rachel: Oh yeah. Definitely you Pheebs.
 Rachel: Hey. Oh I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with who would you pick?
 Rachel: Wait a minute you’re only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
 Rachel: Honey no one thinks you’re a pansy but we do think you need a tissue. (She notices something hanging from Monica’s nose as does Joey.)
 Rachel: Oh my God Jill!
 Rachel: This is Chandler. (Points at him.)
 Rachel: And you know Monica and Ross!
 Rachel: And that’s Phoebe (points) and that’s Joey.
 Rachel: Don’t!! (Joey backs away frightened.) (To Jill) Honey what are you doing here?!
 Rachel: Wow! What did he say?
 Rachel: Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad’s proud of me! My dad’s proud of me.
 Rachel: Oh yeah sorry. Wait honey so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
 Rachel: Jill honey I think this is the best thing that could’ve ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it I-I-I at first I was scared and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay well this is this is what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna get a job you’re gonna get an apartment and then I’ll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs she can stay with us?
 Rachel: (entering) Hey! What’s goin’ on?
 Rachel: (notices Jill’s bags) Jill! Did you shop?!
 Rachel: You went shopping?! What and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill’s nose when you know she’s trying to quit. Wow you guys are terrible!
 Rachel: What’d you get?
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Apartment pants?
 Rachel: No of course of course I’ve heard of them! Ross what did you get?
 Rachel: A pajmena?
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Jill?
 Rachel: Oh come on! You think that’s gonna work on me?! I invented that!
 Rachel: All right it’s okay. One little setback is okay just don’t let it happen again all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff I should take it all away. But I’m just gonna take the-the pajmena. (Ross hands it to her.) And the uh and the uh pants. Y’know what I’m just gonna take it all away ‘cause that way you’ll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty I’m gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. (Leaves with all of Jill’s stuff.)
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: What’s up?!
 Rachel: Well it’d better not be about the apartment pants because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: With Ross and Jill?
 Rachel: With Ross and my sister?
 Rachel: With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
 Rachel: Oh there is no way.
 Rachel: Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it when Ross goes out with anyone but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?! Oh my God and they’re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t—I don’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister this terrible. Oh my God this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
 Rachel: (on the couch) Oh hi! Y’know I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
 Rachel: That is great. Hey y’know who doesn’t have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
 Rachel: Oh so you know that you guys talked about that so you get along so you think you’re gonna go out?
 Rachel: I just Phoebe said y’know thought she saw something between you guys.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Oh not-not so much. Umm what-what do you what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
 Rachel: Are-are you saying he’s a geek?
 Rachel: No! No I no Ross is not a geek!
 Rachel: What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
 Rachel: Oh no-no-no no-no-no that’s not what I meant.
 Rachel: Yeah but he’s not your type.
 Rachel: Yeah but you don’t you don’t you don’t want to try to much too fast. Y’know? I mean you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don’t you?
 Rachel: She-she died Jill.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Well yeah…
 Rachel: Really?!
 Rachel: Oh so-so not really never.
 Rachel: Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
 Rachel: Well I-I don’t like it.
 Rachel: It’s kinda slutty.
 Rachel: Yeah well I’m-I’m a slut.
 Rachel: Rachel.
 Rachel: Yeah I know and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it’s not!
 Rachel: Why aren’t you home yet?!
 Rachel: Oh yes it’s me! Sorry!
 Rachel: Uh I’m just I’m just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
 Rachel: (gasps) Oh he brought her back to his apartment.
 Rachel: Ugh she is a slut!
 Rachel: Oh my God look-look he’s taking off her clothes!
 Rachel: Oh this is just terrible.
 Rachel: Oh. (Squeaks again.)
 Rachel: Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
 Rachel: Yeah. And y’know who should’ve shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
 Rachel: Oh don’t even ask!
 Rachel: Oh Ross hi! Hey how are ya? There you are!
 Rachel: (to Gunther) I’ll take a coffee. (To Ross) So how was your big date last night?
 Rachel: Yeah fun? Great! So uh so did you guys hit it off?
 Rachel: So uh so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
 Rachel: Oh slides. (Laughs.) So really nothing happened.
 Rachel: Right. Was it the Please don’t show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?
 Rachel: She asked-asked you out again?
 Rachel: Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can’t! I can’t! I can’t! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can’t. It’s just too weird all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can’t do it! I can’t do it.
 Rachel: Thank you. I…yeah.
 Rachel: No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross I can’t! I can’t do it! (Starts to freak out.) It’s just gonna freak me out!!!
 Rachel: Ross thanks.
 Rachel: Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No I mean come on that’s-that’s crazy—I mean that’s crazy. So what’s-what’s going on with you? What is going on with you?
 Rachel: Yeah do it now call right now.
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
 Rachel: It’s not random it’s Bob.
 Rachel: No honey okay okay you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
 Rachel: Hm-mmm.
 Rachel: Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history…
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: (changing the subject) Y’know Bob in Human Resources…
 Rachel: Look this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross! There’s a million other guys out there you just…
 Rachel: I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
 Rachel: Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can’t have!
 Rachel: All right all right well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
 Rachel: In Human Resources!!!!!!
 Rachel: …I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
 Rachel: Do I have my own castle?
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: Wow! I mean I just—I can’t I can’t believe this. Y’know I mean you think you know someone even even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.
 Rachel: Absolutely not.
 Rachel: Probably just the first half.
 Rachel: Well it’s hard to tell… (Rachel gets up to get a closer look only she’s having some trouble.) Oh God if she would just stop moving.
 Rachel: Oh it’s a tattoo! That’s weird Phoebe doesn’t… Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula!
 Rachel: Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere.
 Rachel: Well is Ross home? Maybe I’ll just call him to see if he’s actually seen her.
 Rachel: (on phone) What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
 Rachel: Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
 Rachel: Ross I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
 Rachel: Oh! I knew it! What happened?
 Rachel: What?! You kissed!
 Rachel: Well it doesn’t sound like it! I mean it’s pretty easy not to kiss someone you just don’t kiss them! See look at us right now not kissing!
 Rachel: Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! Y’know what? Let me give you something to think about! (She pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.)
 Rachel: Oh well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Wow. I I don’t even know what to say. Thank you. (Gently kicks him.)
 Rachel: Yeah I got that.
 Rachel: Bye-bye-e!
 Rachel: Hey you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
 Rachel: Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
 Rachel: Yeah but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
 Rachel: Well apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad? (Giggles.) God could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
 Rachel: Merrill Lynch?
 Rachel: Well why didn’t you take the job?
 Rachel: (gasps) Rob Tillman!
 Rachel: Oh I’m sorry. Ross Tillman.
 Rachel: Ohh of course Monica’s brother!
 Rachel: Wow! How are you?!
 Rachel: Ohh! Me too!
 Rachel: Oh it’s the best! (They both exhale contemplating the joys of marriage.) So umm how’s Monica?
 Rachel: Ohh I would love too.
 Rachel: Ohh! Okay!
 Rachel: Oh wait don’t you have to pay for your (looks at his magazine) Busty Ladies?
 Rachel: (laughs) Oh yeah? Okay.
 Rachel: But! Don’t you have to give him his money back?
 Rachel: Ohh so do you! Did you lose weight? (She’s not quite sure of that one.)
 Rachel: Oh yeah.
 Rachel: Oh yeah. Right. So now are—do you do you still do music?
 Rachel: (interrupting him and seeing Joey) Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives just walked in here!
 Rachel: (stunned) You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
 Rachel: He’s coming over! He’s coming over!
 Rachel: (giggles and can’t look at him) Hi!
 Rachel: (still not quite able to look at him) Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you…
 Rachel: Ah!
 Rachel: Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: (laughs) Wow! Umm y’know I-I would really love to but I-I shouldn’t.
 Rachel: (awestruck then not) Isn’t that a line from the show?!
 Rachel: That’s a line from the show too!
 Rachel: Yeah sure iced tea would be great.
 Rachel: (mouthing it to him) Yes you did.
 Rachel: Oh Mon listen I have to ask! Okay Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment now does he do this with a lot of girls?
 Rachel: Ohh! And I’m one of them!! Wow! Oh I just cannot believe this! I mean Joey Tribbiani!
 Rachel: Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y’know I just wish we could be like on a break!
 Rachel: Oh it’s so easy for you I mean you’re not married you get to have sex with who ever you want!
 Rachel: Monica. You’ve you’ve done it right?
 Rachel: Oh my God! You’re a 30 year old virgin!
 Rachel: Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey you’ve waited long enough!!
 Rachel: Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions! Y’know people should be able to sleep with who ever they want whenever…
 Rachel: Oh what do you know? Virgin!
 Rachel: (very relived) Oh! Thank God!
 Rachel: Okay! (She picks up the phone Joey’s phone number and starts to dial.) Here we go! Okay! (On phone.) Hi Joey! It’s Rachel! Umm I am free tomorrow night. Yeah sure sure I can bring some sandwiches.
 Rachel: Ohh I mean it’s just so realistic!
 Rachel: Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! (Laughs and finishes her drink.)
 Rachel: Oh I probably shouldn’t—so I will! (Joey starts making her refill and Rachel notices that rain thing Joey has.) Oh! Wow! It’s like it’s raining!
 Rachel: Umm can I use your bathroom?
 Rachel: Okay. (Starts to go.) God y’know if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani’s apartment…
 Rachel: Yeah it sure is!
 Rachel: Joey you’re such an amazing actor! (He smiles.) How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
 Rachel: Wow! Tell me something Joey—(She falls off the couch)—Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
 Rachel: Okay. (She climbs back onto the couch.)
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Wow! I can’t I can’t feel my hands.
 Rachel: (wakes up suddenly and realizes where she is) Oh right.
 Rachel: (groans) Oh God. Oh I can’t believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
 Rachel: Noo! Oh God we did—we didn’t we didn’t uhh…
 Rachel: God I’m just a horrible person.
 Rachel: Because I’m married. That’s right I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star’s apartment to have an affair! Uck!
 Rachel: Yeah and I’m a horrible horrible person.
 Rachel: The ring from the cave yeah.
 Rachel: (seeing the ring and gasping) Oh my God they let you keep that stuff?!
 Rachel: No! No-no-no…
 Rachel: But I thought that ring stood for Caprice’s undying love for her brother.
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Ohh! My God! Barry!!
 Rachel: Oh that’s right! I’m sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
 Rachel: Hi Ross!
 Rachel: Is Joey Tribbiani here?
 Rachel: Well if you see him will you please tell him that I’m looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
 Rachel: Me? I’m great! I’m fine! I’m sooo good!! But you know who’s not great?! Men! You’re a man right Ross?!
 Rachel: Sit down!
 Rachel: Let me uh let me ask you something do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we’re going out of town bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor’s dog walker?!
 Rachel: No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
 Rachel: Aw what are you?! A detective?
 Rachel: Oh. (Doesn’t believe it.)
 Rachel: Who are these men?
 Rachel: Well you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is (whispers) gay.
 Rachel: Good day for married people huh?
 Rachel: I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great either.
 Rachel: Yeah kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there (points) and pretend you’re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
 Rachel: Isn’t that a kind of sushi?
 Rachel: Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
 Rachel: (To Phoebe) Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
 Rachel: Well Valentine’s Day was like two weeks ago so I wouldn’t get her a calendar!
 Rachel: Aw I love that.
 Rachel: (interrupting him) Okay-okay-okay! So making things. That sounds like so much fun.
 Rachel: Hey wait a minute! That is my sock!
 Rachel: What the hell was that?!
 Rachel: All right so we weren’t prepared!
 Rachel: Ahhhhh salmon skin roll. (She does the finger thing.)
 Rachel: Yep!
 Rachel: Oh of course!
 Rachel: Definitely! Phoebe you will not find a single game show host who’s ass I cannot kick.

 Rachel: I don’t like sitting up here! I’m just gonna over… (She starts to get up.)
 Rachel: Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
 Rachel: I… Well I don’t think they need any help.
 Rachel: Who wrote it?
 Rachel: Okay wait a minute wait a minute why are we so sure that this is a girl?
 Rachel: (entering from the bathroom) Hey Mon? I’m gonna check my messages.

 Rachel: (on phone) Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! (Hangs up) That was the fire department there was a fire at our place!
 Rachel: Well he didn’t say but it was a fire. I’m guessing not very good. Come on we gotta go!
 Rachel: My God! (They both run into the bedrooms.)
 Rachel: Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater. (Hold it up.)
 Rachel: Fine! I’m sorry for your loss! (Hands it back to her.)
 Rachel: (stands up) Wow! Oh-okay look pal I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
 Rachel: Okay Phoebe calm down there’s no need to place blame. Okay? (To the fireman) I warned her about those candles.
 Rachel: Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here.
 Rachel: Hey! Hey-hey now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
 Rachel: Okay! (She jumps on the bed.)
 Rachel: I have.

 Rachel: Hi Joey how ya doin’?
 Rachel: Huh yeah I guess we are roommates now.
 Rachel: I’m not paying for half of that! I’m only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
 Rachel: That refrigerators don’t live as long as people.
 Rachel: You’re jokin’ right?
 Rachel: Thank God you’re pretty. (Exits.)
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Do you guys know any cute guys?
 Rachel: Anyway there’s this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table so I kinda have to go…
 Rachel: I don’t know something either trees or disease—Ralph mumbles a lot.
 Rachel: Yeah! It’s weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
 Rachel: Well someone that has his own tux or has the ability to rent a tux.
 Rachel: Oo! When’s her birthday?!
 Rachel: Well y’know it’s just been so long since I’ve been to Chuckie Cheese.
 Rachel: Hey! You guys umm I want you to meet Sebastian.
 Rachel: We just uh we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. (Chandler’s shocked.) What? I read that.
 Rachel: Oh yes! Thank you! (He does so and Rachel sits down on the couch.)
 Rachel: (shocked) What?
 Rachel: You found me a guy?
 Rachel: Well y’know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I’m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
 Rachel: Oh thank you.
 Rachel: What are you guys doing?
 Rachel: Oh but y’know no you didn’t give me your phone number.

 Rachel: I’m just sort of in the middle of something.
 Rachel: Okay y’know what? Maybe I should go!
 Rachel: Yeah I’m good.
 Rachel: No-no! Don’t dance for me! Please? Don’t! (She gets up to yell at her ‘friends.’) What is the matter with you guys?
 Rachel: I… Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
 Rachel: I’ll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It’s you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much but I do not need you to get me a date!
 Rachel: I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean no offense to you guys. Really! I mean (To Patrick) congratulations on all the cash (He nods) and-and y’know—(Feels Eldad’s hair)—Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! (Grabs her stuff starts to leave then turns back suddenly and to Eldad) Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
 Rachel: Thank you! (Storms out.)
 Rachel: Oh that’s all right! Y’know I ended up having a really good time. Y’know the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
 Rachel: I wanna say a disease.
 Rachel: Huh. All right.
 Rachel: Oh-oh Professor Geller.
 Rachel: So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
 Rachel: Huh—Wait so Joey if you get this you’re gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you’ll be like the Big Cheese! (To Phoebe) Or the Big Mac—Hey! You love those!
 Rachel: Joey what are you talking about? You’re a terrific actor.
 Rachel: Ugh how can you even ask that question?!
 Rachel:  Im sorry what?
 Rachel:  (on the phone) Monica I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! (Pause) I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it!

 Rachel: Already? That’s pretty bad what you did.
 Rachel: I’m sure he will forgive you. Look we have all been there! Y’know you fight you make up it’s just the way it works.
 Rachel: Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
 Rachel: What?!!

 Rachel: Yknow I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
 Rachel: And hey! Just so you know it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
 Rachel: That is the most ridiculous...
 Rachel: I did not sell you out.
 Rachel: Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead]
 Rachel: OK well you wouldnt let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]
 Rachel: Fine!
 Rachel: Okay Chandler!
 Rachel: And your horoscope says On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift.
 Rachel: Op but the twelfth brings a lover’s spat.
 Rachel: Oh wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
 Rachel: (ecstatic) Oh my God! It’s Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
 Rachel: Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: (To Phoebe) We do?
 Rachel: Okay.

 Rachel: Oh! Ross is sooo great!
 Rachel: (seeing him) Oh hi!
 Rachel: Oh! Well let’s look for them. (Finds some under one of the couch cushions. It has a pink fuzzy ball on the key chain.) Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
 Rachel: All right! (Throws them back under the cushion.)
 Rachel: Oh good.
 Rachel: (chasing after him) Oh wait! Sorry Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
 Rachel: Paul. Umm I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
 Rachel: You just don’t look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
 Rachel: Oh. We?
 Rachel: Oh no! Yes! Of course I know that! I just—I meant y’know are you still a ‘We’ or are you just ‘You?’
 Rachel: (sympathetic) Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
 Rachel: Ohh. (She touches his arm for support and likes what she feels) Ooh!
 Rachel: I was just getting him to like you.
 Rachel: Ross Joey is not here.
 Rachel: Ross it’s okay. You can come out.
 Rachel: Bye!
 Rachel: Well y’know he lost his keys so he was looking for them…
 Rachel: No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y’know for like two hours and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
 Rachel: Ross what’s the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
 Rachel: Wh—You dated my sister!
 Rachel: What? Why?!
 Rachel: Ross look look this is good for you. Okay? Let’s face it so far the guy’s not lovin’ ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner y’know? And I can talk you up! Ross the guy is a very very successful lawyer!
 Rachel: Oh it’s important!
 Rachel: So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up so Ross selflessly offered to take me.
 Rachel: Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.
 Rachel: Oh we were but that was just a (pause as the audience reacts) I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
 Rachel: Oh! Whoops! I’m sorry you were talking about Emily!
 Rachel: I mean if you think about it I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
 Rachel: Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily he just didn’t tell me. (Everyone looks at her Ross not happily.) Maybe I have to pee again. (Gets up to try to use the bathroom.)
 Rachel: (returning) Wait-wait-wait I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
 Rachel: Oh! I’ve got a lot of those too!
 Rachel: What’s the matter?
 Rachel: So what-what is the exhibit.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
 Rachel: Umm.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Ooh the gift shop!
 Rachel: Oh wait yes but I can’t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight he said he has a big surprise planned.
 Rachel: What?! No! Why?!
 Rachel: I didn’t know you could get married here.
 Rachel: Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
 Rachel: Monica you should totally put your name down on the list
 Rachel: Yeah hon it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it.
 Rachel: I’m gonna do it too!
 Rachel: Really? Who would who would you marry?
 Rachel: Oh Pheebs.
 Rachel: (from another room) Oh my God what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
 Rachel: It’s so secluded up here.
 Rachel: I feel like we’re the only two people in the world. (She sets down her wine class picks up a walnut and knocks another one on the floor.) Oops. Sorry. (She reaches down to pick it up and Ross hands it to her. Ross is hiding under the couch and causes Rachel to scream.)
 Rachel: No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I—would you—actually would you go check on that?
 Rachel: Well okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
 Rachel: Okay. (After Paul leaves Rachel drops to the floor to confront Ross.) What?! What are you doing here?!
 Rachel: I came with Paul!
 Rachel: Get up!
 Rachel: Ahh. Thank you!
 Rachel: Op ice. I need ice.
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! (Ross gets up and heads for the kitchen.) No! Not in there! He’s in there! (She points Ross to the door next to the kitchen.)
 Rachel: Go-go!
 Rachel: Ohh thank you.
 Rachel: Well she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
 Rachel: Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
 Rachel: Well why do y’know go in that room (points to the room Ross is in) and do your homework?
 Rachel: That’s your that’s your dad’s bedroom. (Yelling) That’s your dad’s bedroom!
 Rachel: Whoa that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
 Rachel: Really? Okay. Okay I-I’ll go upstairs. (to Paul) If-if you get me something from the car.
 Rachel: Surprise me.
 Rachel: (yelling) So you’re gonna be in the car I will be upstairs and that’s where everybody’s gonna be!
 Rachel: (yelling from the living room) Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don’t go in there! Don’t go in there! I need another soda!
 Rachel: Oh my God Ross! What in heaven’s name are you doing here?
 Rachel: Good. Although y’know he-he’s a private guy. Y’know I wish I could get him to open up a little bit share some feelings.
 Rachel: So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: (To Phoebe) Okay.
 Rachel: Okay. (Gets up and starts to leave with Paul.)
 Rachel: Yeah that’s great. But first wait talk to me talk to me. Tell me about your day.
 Rachel: Okay. Hey what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
 Rachel: Yeah that’s great Paul but y’know I wanna know what—(Puts her hands on his shoulders)—Wow those are really great! I just wanna know what what is behind this-this strong silent exterior. Y’know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
 Rachel: No Paul I don’t know anything about you! Y’know like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
 Rachel: Okay well then how about puberty! Come on that’s always a painful time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
 Rachel: Well you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway umm… The rest of you life y’know? Any regrets?
 Rachel: All right Paul I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: All right.
 Rachel: Hm-mmm.
 Rachel: That’s-that’s great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay come on. Now we can go eat. Let’s go. (Gets up to leave but Paul doesn’t move.)
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Yeah. Yeah I-I-I see the scare. Listen Paul I think this is really great that-that y’know you shared your feelings. It’s really it’s beautiful but umm what do you say we go share some food?
 Rachel: What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
 Rachel: My God I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I wouldn’t do that!
 Rachel: Oh my God! Oh my God!!
 Rachel: Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God I didn’t know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy clingy moist monster!
 Rachel: What’s the other one?
 Rachel: Oh that’s right. You’re the talker. (They both reflect on that briefly) Anyway uh great idea! Umm I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
 Rachel: No you don’t!
 Rachel: Hi. I’m back.
 Rachel: Ah that’s great. No actually that’s… (In a sexy voice) That’s great! That’s really great! Y’know I gotta tell ya writing I mean writing gets me uh gets me kinda hot.
 Rachel: A lover?
 Rachel: Oh yeah surfer?
 Rachel: Okay hold on real quick hold on a second let me just uh (sits on the counter and buttons her sweater to show some cleavage) get a little more comfortable here. Wait now wait a second this isn’t too revealing is it?
 Rachel: I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y’know the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
 Rachel: Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’t mean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming.
 Rachel: I’m so glad I’m so glad you shared. (Feeling his shoulder.) And I’m glad that you’re done. What do you say we umm… (Nods in the direction of the bedroom.)
 Rachel: (who has just entered) Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby I’ll dump you too!
 Rachel: Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! (Hugs him.) You guys are gonna be so happy!
 Rachel: (gasps) Nice! One and a half carat easy.
 Rachel: Yeah? Well you should know. You’ve bought like a billion of ‘em.
 Rachel: Ohh…
 Rachel: (entering) Hey!
 Rachel: Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring the better I look. So Monica? Chandler?
 Rachel: Oh my God I’m so sorry.
 Rachel: How about you guys? (Points to Phoebe and Joey.)
 Rachel: I think so.
 Rachel: Hey! Ross listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
 Rachel: See? Now he could date her.
 Rachel: (breaking up) We’re just really…very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
 Rachel: Oh! Thank you!
 Rachel: Uh well uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
 Rachel: (suddenly worried) Uh wh-why?
 Rachel: Oh hi!
 Rachel: Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson this is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Mr. Thompson. (She introduces them.) He’s the head of my department.
 Rachel: And I also brought my friend Joey…
 Rachel: Well y’know I-I don’t know where he is.
 Rachel: Well y’know what? Actually I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Thank you. (Mr. Thompson walks away and after he’s left.) Okay (writing her bid down) twenty dollars.
 Rachel: Ugh! So close!
 Rachel: What are you doing?
 Rachel: Well now it’s an empty bar.
 Rachel: What?! What?! What?!
 Rachel: Joey! It is an auction! You don’t guess you buy!
 Rachel: Joey! Sit down! (Pulls him down.)
 Rachel: What were you thinking?!
 Rachel: Wh?!
 Rachel: Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
 Rachel: Ugh!
 Rachel: Phoebe don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink?
 Rachel: How is you drinking helping the kids?
 Rachel: Joey! Joey good one! (Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)
 Rachel: (stopping him) Hey! You…can’t…leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave my boss is gonna kill me!
 Rachel: I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. All right this is what we’re gonna do we are gonna go to the next highest bidder and we are just gonna let them buy it and then you’re just gonna pay the difference.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Not great.
 Rachel: Oh great!
 Rachel: (To Phoebe) Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
 Rachel: Oh well hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18000.
 Rachel: (To Joey) Okay. Okay. (Shushes him.)
 Rachel: Ohh…
 Rachel: Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife’s name?
 Rachel: Pam! Oh God okay just imagine this The Pam.
 Rachel: Okay uh-uh imagine this The Mr. Bowmont.
 Rachel: Okay look let me paint you a little picture. (She sits down next to him.) All right you are settin’ sail up the Hudson! You’ve got the wind in your h—(sees that he’s bald)—arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you’ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin’! You can—ooh you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain and then when you’re old Cappy.
 Rachel: (To Joey) What?! What?!
 Rachel: But Joey you don’t have $20000!
 Rachel: (entering) Hey! (Sees Monica gasps and runs over to her.) Oh my God you’re here let me see your hand!!
 Rachel: Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler gettin’ married.
 Rachel: Ohh… I mean two best friends falling in love how often does that happen?
 Rachel: No! I’m so happy for them!
 Rachel: I’m so happy and not at all jealous.
 Rachel: I mean I’m probably 98% happy maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing.
 Rachel: Yeah me too.
 Rachel: (staring at him) Wh—no but y’know who did stop in here looking for ya Tennille.
 Rachel: We’re gonna find love!
 Rachel: Yeah I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
 Rachel: Well y’know some people make deals with a friend like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40 they marry each other.
 Rachel: Exactly!
 Rachel: You do?
 Rachel: Who?
 Rachel: Joey?!
 Rachel: Are you serious?!
 Rachel: Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40 you’re gonna marry Joey.
 Rachel: Oh seriously?
 Rachel: Charming.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Hey you!
 Rachel: Oh thank you. Hey y’know I’m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
 Rachel: Yeah love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it?
 Rachel: So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we’re 40 we get married. I mean we know each other we like each other and we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like What’s that?!
 Rachel: Exactly.
 Rachel: What? Who?
 Rachel: Phoebe?! Wait a—but-but she just she said that Joey was her backup.
 Rachel: Ross! I just had a conversation with her and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
 Rachel: Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!
 Rachel: Oh God Phoebe!
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Okay y’know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin (does so) and I’m gonna right Ross on the other napkin (does so) and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
 Rachel: Pick one.
 Rachel: You’re welcome.
 Rachel: (reading) Joey! (Pause) We should just switch.
 Rachel: Ohhh this is the least jealous I’ve ever been!
 Rachel: Oh hell he’s done this three times! He knows what its about!
 Rachel: Yeah Pheebs honey she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she’s even had time to…
 Rachel: (To Monica) Yeah you’re on your own.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: (quietly) Oh thanks.
 Rachel: I don’t know y’know? I feel a little umm… No y’know what? Nevermind I’m gonna be fine.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Well thank you you too.
 Rachel: Hey do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
 Rachel: Ohh…
 Rachel: Yeah I guess. I-I… I mean do-do you think we’re ever gonna have that?
 Rachel: Oh no-no-no-no-no no no! We you with someone and me with someone.
 Rachel: Shake it off.
 Rachel: No absolutely. Y’know like it was umm…
 Rachel: Yeah just give me a minute! (Thinking) Oh well yes I can think of one good thing.
 Rachel: Well you uh you were always really good at the uh at the uh the stuff.
 Rachel: Uh-hmm uh-hmm yeah yeah I really liked your hands.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: Oh I know. Hey y’know what we never did? (Ross looks at her.) Oh no not that. (Ross nods okay.) We uh we never had bonus night!
 Rachel: Y’know bonus night. Y’know when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
 Rachel: Yeah-yeah we never had that
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh honey but it is just about…
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
 Rachel: Honey I swear it we just kissed.
 Rachel: Okay come on Phoebe it’s nothing! Monica come on!
 Rachel: No!
 Rachel: No-no it’s really not huge.
 Rachel: Joey you are not! You’re 31.
 Rachel: Honey Monica this is ridiculous! Look…
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn’t want to talk especially with me? I mean why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
 Rachel: Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously what did she mean by that? (Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!
 Rachel: I care!
 Rachel: Y’know what I-I have to go talk to her would you let me just get changed?
 Rachel: Am I going to let you watch me undress?
 Rachel: Monica what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want to talk to anyone especially me?
 Rachel: No-no seriously-seriously what was the especially me part about?
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Monica what are you talking about?
 Rachel: Monica y’know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
 Rachel: Oh!!
 Rachel: Monica your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
 Rachel: Ugh Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder!
 Rachel: All right easy mimey the moment has passed it ain’t gonna happen!
 Rachel: I swear I never wanted any part of your night!
 Rachel: (ignoring them) Monica why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
 Rachel: Oh wow. That—y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross let’s go have sex!
 Rachel: We’re not gonna do this all right? She’s just gonna think that we’re doin’ it.
 Rachel: Who is it?
 Rachel: Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to follow her lead but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)
 Rachel: Yeah you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May we help you?
 Rachel: All right Monica do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
 Rachel: No you don’t know why!
 Rachel: Because! Because I was sad.
 Rachel: Look I am so…so happy for you guys but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
 Rachel: Anyway sweetie I am I’m so sorry I ruined your night.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Yeah so let’s get started on the wedding plans!
 Rachel: Yeah we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers the caterers the music…
 Rachel: Oh wait Chandler too many cooks…
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Aw.
 Rachel: What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
 Rachel: Joey there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Now Joey what did the duck do?!
 Rachel: Hey Joey what ‘cha doing?
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: Joey did you my face cream?
 Rachel: Joey (nervously) where did you learn that word?
 Rachel: (gasps) You found my book?!
 Rachel: Joey what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
 Rachel: Hey-hey y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my book. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality which by the way you will never understand. (She goes into her room.)
 Rachel: Well what happened at dinner?
 Rachel: Wait but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a rec. center!
 Rachel: No y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. I mean you don’t have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y’know? And-and you don’t need you don’t need this custom-made empire waisted duchess satin gown; you can wear off the rack. (She starts to cry as does Monica.)
 Rachel: Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
 Rachel: Well what?! How-how much is it?!
 Rachel: Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!
 Rachel: (starting to cry) Ohh you guys are so made for each other.
 Rachel: (quietly) Joey.
 Rachel: Uh-huh I get it smoke chimney chimney sweep very funny ha-ha.
 Rachel: Well no I don’t smell anything.
 Rachel: Nothing!
 Rachel: Y’know I can not believe you told him Joey!
 Rachel: Uh-huh yeah I did because I wore out my first copy when I was with you. (Exits.)
 Rachel: Who are you supposed to be?
 Rachel: Do you even know what a vicar is?
 Rachel: (sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey it’s enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it’s—I’m not—it’s just not funny anymore!
 Rachel: All right! Y’know what? That’s it! You wanna do it?! Let’s do it!
 Rachel: (starting to move closer to him) That’s right I wanna do it with you! I’ve been trying to fight it but you just said all the right things.
 Rachel: (moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh I’ve been waitin’ so long to get on that body!
 Rachel: Yeah that’s right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
 Rachel: Oh come on now don’t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But I would keep that helmet on because you’re in for a rough ride! (He backs into the door.)
 Rachel: Yeah what?
 Rachel: Yeah-yeah did-didn’t you use to have a pair? They were really round burgundy and they made you look kind of umm…
 Rachel: Yes!
 Rachel: Oh y’know what you should get ‘em? One of those little uh portable CD players.
 Rachel: Yeah and-and-and by someone she means Joey.
 Rachel: Y’know Joey I could teach you to sail if you want.
 Rachel: Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
 Rachel: What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
 Rachel: That is the Coast Guard.
 Rachel: Joey just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with the lesson yet.
 Rachel: Okay I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time are you ready?
 Rachel: Oh okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old hot chickas? Okay let’s do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though (grabs some of the rigging) what’s this called?
 Rachel: Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
 Rachel: No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
 Rachel: Time’s up now your dead.
 Rachel: Okay you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)
 Rachel: Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
 Rachel: (laughing) Yeah and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
 Rachel: I don’t know. Y’know they didn’t get us anything.
 Rachel: Well hello! So when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey?
 Rachel: Why not?
 Rachel: What? I was just trying to teach you.
 Rachel: Excuse me I wanted you to help but you couldn’t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
 Rachel: Look Joey I’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
 Rachel: Well does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
 Rachel: Yeah I didn’t want you to get hit by the boom!
 Rachel: All right y’know what? I-I’m sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
 Rachel: I won’t boss you around.
 Rachel: And I’ll be nice.
 Rachel: And—Joey!
 Rachel: Okay Joey honey you’re doing really good! All right now I’m just gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember which side is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
 Rachel: Right?
 Rachel: It’s left sweetie but that’s okay sweetie that’s a tough one.
 Rachel: Okay go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of the boat.) The left!
 Rachel: (yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)
 Rachel: No! No-no no-no-no very quiet said with love no yelling.
 Rachel: Okay Joey we’re luffing a little bit so could you tighten up the cunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)
 Rachel: Joey come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)
 Rachel: (angrily) No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
 Rachel: What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit!
 Rachel: Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do not quit!
 Rachel: Oh my God wait did I—I just said Greens don’t quit didn’t I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens don’t quit?!
 Rachel: No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you I’m just yelling near you. Oh God Joey ohh I’m my father. Oh my God this is horrible! I’ve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh Joey I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Awww…
 Rachel: Left.
 Rachel: Well Joey I hate to admit it your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
 Rachel: Ohh we’re not sailing.
 Rachel: All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.) Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees what’s in the cooler.) Sandwiches!
 Rachel: (hands him one) Here you go.
 Rachel: Oh wow! (She takes a bite but holds the sandwich vertically so that the stuff falls out.)
 Rachel: Ohh sorry.
 Rachel: Ohh whoops.
 Rachel: That’s nice.
 Rachel: Well that was umm…Okay.
 Rachel: Ohh no you don’t! You got lighting last time lighting is mine!
 Rachel: What are you gonna do Pheebs?
 Rachel: (entering excitedly) Oh! Hi you guys oh my God! You’ll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and…
 Rachel: Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
 Rachel: Okay so anyway I’m sittin’ in my office and guess who walks in.
 Rachel: Joey!
 Rachel: Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. (To Monica and Phoebe) It was Ralph Lauren! (Monica and Phoebe gasp) Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
 Rachel: It’s the same story.
 Rachel: (ignoring him) Anyway Ralph just came in to tell me that he’s so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: I got—I get a big pay raise!
 Rachel: I get to hire my own assistant!
 Rachel: (reading the resume) And you were at this job for four years?
 Rachel: Okay well this is all very impressive Hilda um I just have one last question for you. Uh how did I do? Was this okay?
 Rachel: I’ve never interviewed anyone before. I’ve actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid we did have a maid but this is-this isn’t the same thing.
 Rachel: No. Yeah and I know that. All right well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.

 Rachel: Oh come on what are you talking about? You’ve got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday’s come on!
 Rachel: Okay hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and takes his picture.) I’m sorry it’s for human resources everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
 Rachel: Chandler you have an assistant right?
 Rachel: No I-I just don’t know how you decide who to hire. I mean I’ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy…
 Rachel: I love him. He’s so pretty I wanna cry! I don’t know what to do. Tell me what to do.
 Rachel: Uh-huh. No I hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!
 Rachel: Okay you’re right. I’ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!

 Rachel: Really? (Giggles.)
 Rachel: Yeah this is Tag. Tag this is Phoebe. Phoebe can I see you for a second? (Goes into office.)
 Rachel: (grabbing Phoebe) Okay. We’ll be right back. (They go into her office and she closes the door.)
 Rachel: All right I know I know how it looks Pheebs but I’m telling you…
 Rachel: Yes I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I’ve ever done. But I’m telling you from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. (There’s a knock on the door.) Yes?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Gay? Yeah. (Kathy leaves dejectedly.)
 Rachel: (noticing him) Hi! (Puts the pictures away.)
 Rachel: Well yeah sure what’s up?
 Rachel: Oh really?!
 Rachel: Oh did you not want people to know that?
 Rachel: Why’s that?
 Rachel: Ohh you can say. Come on I don’t want you to feel like you can’t tell me things. (Motions for him to sit down.)
 Rachel: ‘Kay.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: (Pause) Yeah she’s gay.
 Rachel: Hey look-look Phoebe’s talking to uh Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
 Rachel: Hey I thought that guy was married.
 Rachel: Phoebe if this guy’s going through a divorce is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
 Rachel: Oh I gotta get back to work.
 Rachel: Yeah but my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
 Rachel: Oh no I know that. I know that. Although we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
 Rachel: I am not gonna get fired because I’m not gonna act on it.
 Rachel: Why? Is he? He is! Isn’t he? He’s dating that slut in marketing!
 Rachel: Oh no sit-ups today Tag?
 Rachel: Oh well drop and give me ten more!
 Rachel: Uh I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
 Rachel: Oh great could you make me four copies of those?
 Rachel: (startled) Ahh hi! Hi! Melissa what’s up? I’m just uh about to umm go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y’know like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What’s up? (She has put on the backpack.)
 Rachel: No. Why?
 Rachel: Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
 Rachel: Okay whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain’t a locker room okay? But y’know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
 Rachel: Oh yeah. All right back to work.
 Rachel: Yeah Melissa I don’t want to be known as the uh office bitch but I will call your supervisor.
 Rachel: Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
 Rachel: Yeah sure. Umm…here. (Hands him one.)
 Rachel: Yeah I don’t think so Joe.
 Rachel: Hey listen umm what-what are you doing tonight?
 Rachel: How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I’ll pay.
 Rachel: I’m not asking you to go on a date with him!
 Rachel: Joey just-just he-he’s new in town and I know he doesn’t have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I’ll really appreciate it.
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Hi Tag! Hey so did you have fun with uh with Joey last night?

 Rachel: Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
 Rachel: Y’know all the women.
 Rachel: All right would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay just the idea of you and he and all these women it’s just—And I know he’s my assistant and I can’t date him—but it just bothers me all right?!
 Rachel: All right will you will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this dating tons of women thing is!
 Rachel: I just don’t want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush—And I will get over it. It’s-it’s not like I love him it’s just physical! But—I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
 Rachel: Yeah. Sure. (Joey nods his head questioningly and Rachel nods no.)
 Rachel: (To Joey) So will you talk to him?

 Rachel: Oh my God! This is it! (She and Phoebe hold hands.) (To Phoebe) I really hope it’s you!
 Rachel: Me too!
 Rachel: Okay bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
 Rachel: Hypothetically!
 Rachel: Uh-hmm.
 Rachel: Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea.
 Rachel: Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now I would like to make a toast to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing (A woman at the table behind them overhears Chandler’s name and starts listening closer) my best friend and truly one of the nicest people that…
 Rachel: Fine!
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Really?!
 Rachel: Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I’m just—Wait a minute. If I’m your maid of honor that means you are Monica’s.
 Rachel: Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica’s!
 Rachel: Why does it matter so much to you?!
 Rachel: What-what if I marry Ross—Or Joey?
 Rachel: Yeah but Phoebe…
 Rachel: Okay. Okay. It’s—since you’ve never done it before you can be Monica’s made of honor.
 Rachel: I’m gonna marry someone good y’know.
 Rachel: Better than Chandler. (Phoebe exhales as if to say Like what isn’t?)
 Rachel: Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor!
 Rachel: (shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!!
 Rachel: All right that’s it! I am maid of honor!
 Rachel: How come you are?!
 Rachel: Oh come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?!
 Rachel: Okay. Okay fine y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. (Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii Ross! Sweetie.
 Rachel: Okay uh…
 Rachel: …it’s gonna be okay!
 Rachel: Look Monica getting cold feet is very common. Y’know it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.
 Rachel: Thanks!
 Rachel: Thank you judges.
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
 Rachel: Ohh wait a minute we haven’t pre…
 Rachel: Okay! Okay! Umm Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage as… (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay never mind! Forget it! Umm umm okay uh… I met I-I met I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25 although he seemed like a six year old.
 Rachel: Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm I’ve known them separately and I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holds it up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
 Rachel: Aw thanks!
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm I wonder where I’ve heard that before.)
 Rachel: No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway this was ridiculous—We’re gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the coin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)
 Rachel: Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her her vegetarian voodoo goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)
 Rachel: Hi Pheebs.
 Rachel: Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby.
 Rachel: Yeah. Yeah and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
 Rachel: Yeah! Oh umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together y’know just in case…
 Rachel: Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny look this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows Phoebe the picture.) And look she made me carry her train which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here’s a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse) Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
 Rachel: And umm vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause people cry at weddings. (Starting to cry.) I’m just gonna grab a couple of these.
 Rachel: Oh I forgot this was in here. Umm this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s blue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah…
 Rachel: You do? Why?
 Rachel: But Pheebs y’know you earned it.
 Rachel: No I was ten. I just developed early.
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Yeah okay you laugh now but she’s gonna be yours. (Phoebe gets suddenly scared.)
 Rachel: Hi! Oh how was your date last night?
 Rachel: Oh good. (She walks to the closed bathroom door opens it and finds a naked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God sorry! (She closes the door and confronts Joey.)
 Rachel: What-what?! You’re gonna leave this person with me?!
 Rachel: Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
 Rachel: Y’know what? That’s a lot to remember can’t I just tell her you’re a pig?
 Rachel: Well forget it I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: Yeah Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: (pause) Would you like some pancakes?
 Rachel: Yeah we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
 Rachel: I know!
 Rachel: Oh and I’ll call ya too!
 Rachel: Bye!
 Rachel: Oh Joey I’m sorry I just couldn’t tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y’know we got to talking and I…
 Rachel: Cupid.
 Rachel: Look Joey come on she’s so perfect for you! I mean she’s sweet she-she likes baseball and she-she had two beers at lunch.
 Rachel: Yeah maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
 Rachel: Fine. (They start to walk away.)
 Rachel: Phoebe!
 Rachel: I’m sorry?
 Rachel: Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
 Rachel: Yeah there was. It was—there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read—Yes there was.
 Rachel: Well now what’s the rush?
 Rachel: Well look who’s here!
 Rachel: Hi! Well we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe we forgot that party we have to go to.
 Rachel: (does a retching sound) Wait a minute! Why don’t you guys do something?!
 Rachel: How did it go with Erin?
 Rachel: (gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkin’ about having kids. Oh my Joey. (She goes over and hugs him.) Oh please don’t get married before I do.
 Rachel: So how’s it goin’ with Joey?
 Rachel: Okay? Wait okay tell-tell me that you like him please? I mean tell me that you like him.
 Rachel: But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
 Rachel: Ugh tramp!
 Rachel: Yeah see ya.
 Rachel: Wow. Well I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Jo-Joey look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh she’s not lookin’ for a serious relationship.
 Rachel: Well she told me. She said she’s kinda a loner.
 Rachel: Joey…
 Rachel: Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell ‘em you’re not looking for a relationship.
 Rachel: Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?
 Rachel: Do you want some pancakes?
 Rachel: All right I got 48.
 Rachel: (counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting?
 Rachel: Oh right. Sorry. But Tags not coming; his girlfriend came into town so hes spending Thanksgiving with her.
 Rachel: Well I was going to but then I figured you know... youre food is so delicious and perfect you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
 Rachel: Seriously its moving!
 Rachel: (gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
 Rachel: Well sure! Come in! (He enters) Well what-what happened to your girlfriend?
 Rachel: Oh Im sorry.
 Rachel: Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean not even puppies?
 Rachel: Oh wait before you guys go can I just ask you a question?
 Rachel: When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
 Rachel: Interesting.

 Rachel: Youre right Im sorry. Thank you. Okay thats what Im gonna do.
 Rachel: Hey!

 Rachel: Yeah? Im sorry about your girlfriend.
 Rachel: So were you guys together a long time?
 Rachel: Now that she broke up with you?
 Rachel: Yeah. Hmmmm.
 Rachel: No…Yeah all the time constantly. Its terrifying. But you know that I figure it…it has to work out.
 Rachel: Because uh—it has to.
 Rachel: Yeah I know I do. I really do.
 Rachel: Well what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug)
 Rachel: Uh yeah well see he… Joey knows that Im-Im very insecure about my back and and…youre hugging me so obviously you are not repulsed by it yeah!
 Rachel: No? (He shakes his head) All right heres the truth um Joey said what he said because um Im attracted to you.
 Rachel: Yeah I admit it. I have a crush on you and uh and and I know thats crazy because we work together and-and nothing could ever happen and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Okay thats gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
 Rachel: (she hurries after him) Wait we still have time to talk and they’re-theyre not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh look there they go okay. (She hurries in too)
 Rachel: Yeah ohh! Why damnit why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee I-I know that I freaked him out
 Rachel: (gasps) Hi!
 Rachel: (uncovers the dog) Hi!
 Rachel: Oh hi! How are you doing?
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Look um I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
 Rachel: Ah I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? It just doesnt matter how I feel. I mean we work together so nothing could really ever happen between us and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday and-and never talk about this again okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So were okay?
 Rachel: Oh god I know it that I freaked you out.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Okay well thats one less thing we have to do on Monday.
 Rachel: (entering happily) Gooood morning!!
 Rachel: Well why shouldn’t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
 Rachel: Come on it’s not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
 Rachel: (pauses as she thinks and exhales loudly) We… We are not… …going to let it… be a problem.
 Rachel: Well y’know we did other stuff too. (Joey and Chandler start to giggle.)
 Rachel: Oh Monica come on y’know I don’t sleep with guys on the first date!
 Rachel: Anymore!!
 Rachel: Hi. Tag I have a conference call today is that correct?
 Rachel: Okay thank you. That’ll be all. (The mail guy leaves and Tag starts to follow but Rachel stops him.) (Excitedly) Wait! Wait! (Rushes over and closes the office-door.) Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us. (They kiss.)
 Rachel: Okay you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in your evaluation.
 Rachel: Well you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y’know there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate. (She turns around and sweeps the stuff off of her desk and hops up onto it.)
 Rachel: No I’ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
 Rachel: (hugging him) So did you read your evaluation yet?
 Rachel: (worried) Okay please you’re kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
 Rachel: I’m thinkin’ no.
 Rachel: Umm I said I thought you were a good kisser and uh and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
 Rachel: Well it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote Yes he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision and under Problems with Performance I wrote Dear God I hope not and then uh then I drew a little smiley face and then a small pornographic sketch.
 Rachel: Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know maybe they didn’t take it the way I meant it.
 Rachel: Ugh I just gotta get the thing back!
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Oh my God! Joey!
 Rachel: Ugh!
 Rachel: Okay I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it but we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office. Now he doesn’t get in until 10 so he’s no problem but his assistant Betty she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
 Rachel: Yeah well Betty’s kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. (Holding up the box of chocolates.) Now while I distract her you get in the office.
 Rachel: Let’s roll!
 Rachel: (worried and shocked) Yeah sure Mr. Zelner for you anything—minute. Okay. Fine. (To Tag) Abort the plan abort the plan. (She start to usher Tag out.)
 Rachel: Okay. Uh well can we can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates? (Holds up the box.)
 Rachel: (laughs) Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean (getting serious) what would happen exactly.
 Rachel: Well…
 Rachel: Oh no-no-no…
 Rachel: You’re lookin’ at it upside down—y’know what? (Grabs the evaluation and throws it out.) It doesn’t matter.
 Rachel: Whoa! I can’t believe you did that. That was really sweet.
 Rachel: No you could’ve lost your job.
 Rachel: Thank you! You’re great! (They kiss.)
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: I… It just—it took me so long to get that desk organized.
 Rachel: (looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)
 Rachel: (freaking out) Oh my god!!
 Rachel: You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
 Rachel: (to Monica) Did you know he was in there?
 Rachel: (entering) Hey!
 Rachel: Drums?
 Rachel: (stopping at Phoebe’s entrance) Ha!
 Rachel: Joey y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
 Rachel: What are you talking about? I love them! (Looks into the cage) Yeah I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died because my cat ate it. And then then my cat died. But Joey isnt this cool?
 Rachel: Oh isnt that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
 Rachel: What? Wait-wait a minute what? Phoebe whats the matter?
 Rachel: And that makes you angry because…
 Rachel: Where did you get that?
 Rachel: Phoebe?
 Rachel: Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey if you wanted to do that you might as well just gotten him a fish you know how fish freaked me out!
 Rachel: It wouldnt have mattered anyway Phoebe you and I are are gonna live together were roommates; thats the deal.
 Rachel: Oh its so much more fun with you.
 Rachel: We did!
 Rachel: Oh I would love to!
 Rachel: Good good good good good. (She runs to the drums and gets the sticks)
 Rachel: (with the sticks in her hands) Um... (She goes to the tarantula-cage and puts the sticks into it) Done!
 Rachel: Oh wow! Look at this place!
 Rachel: (yelling from another room) Oh my God!
 Rachel: (returning) Okay remember uh remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
 Rachel: And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
 Rachel: Do you really not know where I’m going with this? (Phoebe nods No.) It left! It’s one huge room!
 Rachel: See?
 Rachel: You can’t because of the new skylight!
 Rachel: So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
 Rachel: Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we?
 Rachel: Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
 Rachel: Phoebe it’s okay. I like living with Joey.
 Rachel: Oh please I hate packing it’s closer to work and we do have fun. Although I’m really gonna miss living with you.
 Rachel: I know. (They hug.) Oh-oh wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
 Rachel: (entering with Phoebe) Hey!
 Rachel: (seeing the collection of characters.) Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny’s funeral in here.
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: I got it!
 Rachel: Its back in cage!
 Rachel: Joey would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
 Rachel: (freaking out) Oh my god!!
 Rachel: You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.

 Rachel: No. No you can’t.
 Rachel: Oh I don’t-I don’t know.
 Rachel: Yeah actually I think we’re gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
 Rachel: Uh Pheebs we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
 Rachel: Oh. (They leave leaving just Joey and Ross.)
 Rachel: You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable.
 Rachel: Okay. (They start to head for the bedroom) Oh wait! Umm did you send those contracts to Milan?
 Rachel: No seriously y’know the contracts I gave you did you overnight them?
 Rachel: Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don’t get.
 Rachel: Y’know like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? (He starts laughing.) Tag! I’m serious! This isn’t funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
 Rachel: Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said Must go out today and underlined today three times and and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn’t want to seem to bossy.
 Rachel: Y’know what Tag if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
 Rachel: Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
 Rachel: No! Come on its late we’re not gonna go down to the office.
 Rachel: Okay get your coat! (They get their coats and start to leave. Rachel suddenly stops and sticks the hand up the back of her shirt.) Oh! When did you unhook this? (Her bra.) Nice work!
 Rachel: Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess Tag! I mean this is what I’m talking about! You have to be organized! You’ve got newspapers! You’ve got magazines! You got—Ohh! (Finds a picture.) And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag but whatever.
 Rachel: Okay very cute braces. Anyway y’know what the point is Tag start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk. (She goes into her office.)
 Rachel: In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk and then I put a Post-It on it (Looks down onto her desk and finds the folder with the Post-It on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave Tag) that said Must go out today. So you just keep looking in there! All right?
 Rachel: Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um check the copy room maybe you left the contracts in there?
 Rachel: I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It’s not a perfect world! Just go please.
 Rachel: Thank you. (He leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottom drawer. She then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) Hello? (Hangs up the phone.) I still don’t get it.
 Rachel: Hi! I got you some coffee. To uh… (She looks for a place to set it on his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.) …fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
 Rachel: Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
 Rachel: Well yeah I wish that you would. (He opens the top drawer.) Well no it’s not in there! (Closes it.) How about that drawer? (She points to the bottom one and he opens it. She doesn’t see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)
 Rachel: (thinks) Y’know I don’t-I don’t know. Let me let me check. (As she heads for her office she stops glances over her should at Tag looks into her office and finds the folder on her desk.)
 Rachel: Can I see you in my office for a minute?
 Rachel: You put these on my desk!
 Rachel: Oh really? So you’re saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer crawled across the floor then jumped on to my desk?! (I think Dogbert should have a line here.)
 Rachel: (pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) I am so hot for you right now.
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Well y’know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
 Rachel: So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
 Rachel: And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
 Rachel: No?
 Rachel: I’m sorry Rosita? As in…
 Rachel: Joey it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal?
 Rachel: Stevie the TV?
 Rachel: No! (Joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.) Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita us chichas got to stick together! (She tries pulling on the back of the chair until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.) You bitch!
 Rachel: Joey Joey I am so sorry.
 Rachel: Okay come on—Joey I’ll buy you a new one! All right? We’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair.
 Rachel: But don’t you think Rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? I mean y’know she did always put…your comfort first.
 Rachel: (grabbing her coat) Okay? You ready?
 Rachel: You will like it!
 Rachel: You don’t even know!
 Rachel: Well look if you don’t like this…(The audience’s laughter at Chandler’s progress cuts out the rest of Rachel’s line.)
 Rachel: Come on Joey I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey y’know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
 Rachel: Joey the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y’know start the heeling process?
 Rachel: That’s weird.
 Rachel: It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure there’s some explanation.
 Rachel: Joey I really don’t…
 Rachel: Well no.
 Rachel: No y’know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
 Rachel: That’s right Joey the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. (She sits down in the chair.)
 Rachel: (grabbing a beer out of the chair’s fridge) I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
 Rachel: Hey how’s…how’s the uh miracle chair?
 Rachel: Yeah? Wow! Y’know that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
 Rachel: Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
 Rachel: Hey Chandler!
 Rachel: How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines has a rolling massage and speakers in the head rest?
 Rachel: Well what if I told you you can do it in my apartment?
 Rachel: I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000. (Which is an actual product by the way I’m not sure about the 3000 part.)
 Rachel: Well it’s a long story but umm I broke Joey’s chair…
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Ohhhhh. That’s how it got fixed!
 Rachel: Noo! (Laughs) Angels.
 Rachel: What? Wh-hey!
 Rachel: Yeah he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
 Rachel: No Joe no miracle.
 Rachel: Uh-huh! Nice try but you don’t get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! (Joey starts to get up.) No I take that back!
 Rachel: No-no-no! This chair’s not going anywhere.
 Rachel: The logic is that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
 Rachel: We’re the Cobras!
 Rachel: Ahhhh….
 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Oh yeah Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
 Rachel: Good ones?
 Rachel: Well can I keep the presents and still be 29?
 Rachel: Y’know I’m still 29 in Guam.
 Rachel: Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
 Rachel: Look y’know I know my life’s going pretty well but I look around and I just see so many people who’ve accomplished so many other goals by the time they’re thirty.
 Rachel: There you go!
 Rachel: Thirty. Ugh I mean thirty! Monica do you remember mean old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
 Rachel: Nothing. I don’t want to do anything.
 Rachel: Really! God Ross what were you thinking? (To Phoebe quietly) I know it’s really shallow but a part of me wants him again.
 Rachel: Y’know what? I am going to do something today. I’m not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I’m gonna get something pierced. Like my uh like my nose or my tongue or something.
 Rachel: So what?! Y’know what? The way I see it—(Phoebe pulls out a hair from the back of her head)—Ow! Son of a bitch!!
 Rachel: (glares at him) Get out get out of my apartment.
 Rachel: (entering) Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She’s coming!
 Rachel: What’s-what’s going on? Phil’s really pissed!
 Rachel: Okay but taking care of a drunk naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
 Rachel: Ahh!
 Rachel: (opening it) A scooter! (She’s not happy.)
 Rachel: No! No-no I love it. Thank you. (Kisses him.)
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Okay. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday Grandma! It’s better to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down as everyone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying) That’s funny yeah!
 Rachel: (crying) No I know! I get it! It’s funny!
 Rachel: No I know because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things. That’s why it’s so funny. (Runs into her room crying.)
 Rachel: Well I feel fine but I think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids.
 Rachel: Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids…
 Rachel: As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
 Rachel: So if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35 I don’t have to get pregnant until I’m 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant…
 Rachel: No so I don’t have to get married until I’m 33! That’s three years that’s three whole years—Oh wait a minute though. I’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding and I’d like to know the guy for a year year and a half before we get engaged… Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I’m thirty.
 Rachel: No! Ross no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
 Rachel: (To Chandler) I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
 Rachel: Hey. (After she leaves.) Oh poor Pheebs.
 Rachel: Ross I really don’t think…
 Rachel: Hey Joey can I…
 Rachel: Actually I just wanna talk to Tag.
 Rachel: Whatever! Okay I’m not your mother.
 Rachel: Not in the street!!
 Rachel: (to Tag) Hi.
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Yeah I’m doing okay. I’m um…let’s talk.
 Rachel: Umm…
 Rachel: Ohh Tag umm…you’re such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don’t-I don’t…
 Rachel: Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh but I just think I’m past the point where I think I can y’know just have fun.
 Rachel: Yeah it is! But you’re just a kid! I mean you’re 25!
 Rachel: Oh God! Y’know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually if I’m wishin’ for stuff I actually wish I was six years younger.
 Rachel: Yeah I’m sorry. (They hug.)
 Rachel: Oh if I only want two kids can I keep him for another year?
 Rachel: (starting to cry) Ohh…
 Rachel: Yeah it’s just y’know…
 Rachel: Oh! I would love to read a poem.
 Rachel: (crying) It’ll be a short one.
 Rachel: Ohhh…
 Rachel: Wait what do you mean you’re getting a new brain?
 Rachel: She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces I mean I don’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage.
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Cecilia Monroe man what a great actress.
 Rachel: (They both look behind them.) Well Id have to say gay.
 Rachel: Well mainly because hes kissing that other guy.
 Rachel: Oh yeah hes too cute to be straight.
 Rachel: All right straight and not subtle. (The man gets up and leaves.)
 Rachel: Oh well we can hand it to Gunther and hell put it in lost and found.
 Rachel: What if um if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldnt that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
 Rachel: What? Wait! Why…why do you get the story?
 Rachel: Phoebe you had a date three days ago.
 Rachel: Okay. Okay see? I get the phone.
 Rachel: Yeah! (Breaking up) And until now I didn’t think I’d love again.
 Rachel: Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
 Rachel: Well umm maybe we could uhh… (Grabs the phone) Ah-ha! Too slow!!
 Rachel: No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okay look I have an idea. Why don’t we why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
 Rachel: I don’t think so.
 Rachel: (checking the speed dial) All right first name on the speed dial is mom.
 Rachel: Okay no way you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
 Rachel: Yes okay. (Checking the speed dial again.) Well now see this isn’t telling us anything. (Reading the speed dial) Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat’s a steak house!
 Rachel: (looking at the speed dial) Oh I win! He’s got Barney’s on his speed dial.
 Rachel: (showing Phoebe her phone) His new girlfriend!
 Rachel: Hi Pheebs!
 Rachel: How are ya?
 Rachel: Umm Pheebs remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh the cute guy’s cell phone?
 Rachel: And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
 Rachel: And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
 Rachel: You stole the phone!
 Rachel: No? So you’re saying that if I called it it wouldn’t ring?
 Rachel: Umm okay. But while you dial let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. (Rachel dials her phone and Phoebe’s bag starts to ring.) Oh it does work! (Rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of Phoebe’s handbag.)
 Rachel: Phoebe!
 Rachel: Oh is it?! (She answers the cute guy’s phone.) Uhh hello? (On her phone) Yes hi is Rachel there? (On the other phone) Yes she is just one moment please. (To Phoebe holding out both phones.) It’s for me!
 Rachel: Oh my God! I bet that’s him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh (In a sexy voice) Hello? Or should I be (Happily) Hi! It’s Rach… (Phoebe knocks the phone out of Rachel’s hand catches it and answers it.) Would you stop doing that?!
 Rachel: Phoebe! You can’t do th…
 Rachel: You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
 Rachel: You just said it!
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe!
 Rachel: Ohh! (Exits.)
 Rachel: Hey! Hey!
 Rachel: Well why shouldn’t I?!
 Rachel: Well then I get to give him the cell phone.
 Rachel: (laughs) You’re not the man who left the cell phone.
 Rachel: Is-is he coming? (Looks hopefully out the door.)
 Rachel: We’ll be right back sir.
 Rachel: I don’t know!
 Rachel: I know! (Realizes what Phoebe said.) What?!
 Rachel: (turning and looking at Tom again) No-no they do but you just have to wait.
 Rachel: (fake disappointment) All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him but you owe me; you owe me big!
 Rachel: Ohh…
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
 Rachel: (screaming) MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!! (Runs to Monica’s.)
 Rachel: God. You seem really really nice.
 Rachel: I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: You are so beautiful.
 Rachel: (giggles) (To Ross) I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
 Rachel: No!
 Rachel: Hi! Hi Ben!
 Rachel: Oh yeah go ahead.
 Rachel: No. No.
 Rachel: Ben its Rachel! (He closes the door.) But whatever.
 Rachel: Awww just like his daddy.
 Rachel: What-what about Monica?
 Rachel: (nervous) So it would just be me alone?
 Rachel: Huh umm…
 Rachel: Well that—y’know it’s just uh I’ve never done that before. Me and him alone.
 Rachel: Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh what do I what do I do with him?
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Yeah I think so.
 Rachel: Bye. (Ross exits.) Ahhh… (Silence) So this is fun huh?
 Rachel: Okay. Uh want something-want something to drink?
 Rachel: Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
 Rachel: Okay. Well that’s pretty much all that we have—Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita? (Holds up a bottle of margarita mix.)
 Rachel: Water it is.
 Rachel: Ben y’know when uh when you were a baby you and I used to hang out all the time. ‘Cause I was I was your daddy’s girlfriend.
 Rachel: No I’m not.
 Rachel: Hey! We were not on a—Okay. That’s fine! Fine. Y’know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas okay?
 Rachel: (checks her watch) Fifty-two minutes. (Pause) So no-no brothers and sisters huh? That must be nice. You don’t have to share stuff.
 Rachel: Oh you’re one of those. But y’know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
 Rachel: Well y’know we would umm repeat everything the other said or uh we’d jump out of closets to scare each other or switch the sugar for the salt so they’d put salt on their cereal.
 Rachel: Yeah? You like that one?
 Rachel: I’m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey I’ve got a ton of these! Umm oh hear—Do you want a good one? Here’s a good one. Umm you uh you take a quarter take a quarter and and you blacken the edge. Right? (Does so.) And then you say to person I bet you can’t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it they’re left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
 Rachel: Yeah I-I-I-I’m funny Ben but I’m not stupid. Okay?
 Rachel: Coming.
 Rachel: Uh-oh.
 Rachel: Oh yeah? Did he pull the old… (She is waving her hand up and down her face. She’s thinking about the pencil mark.)
 Rachel: Oh that.
 Rachel: Oh come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat you don’t think that’s just a little funny?!
 Rachel: (looking at his mark) Yes.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Well y’know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself What’s up with Carol and sweet little Ben?
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: I’d love that. I would loooove… (Carol goes to make the coffee and she sits down.) So uh so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
 Rachel: I found him! (To Ben) Very funny come here! (She sits down on the coffee table and Ben walks up.) That is exactly why I’ve come here to talk to you okay?
 Rachel: Yes oh—(To Ben)—Do I want sugar in my coffee? (Ben nods no.) No just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. (To Ben) Okay do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?

 Rachel: Okay maybe they are not funny to you…
 Rachel: Or Carol! But they’re funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
 Rachel: That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout I will be revenged?!
 Rachel: Fine. Fine but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!
 Rachel: Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!
 Rachel: I gotta go! (Runs out.)
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun don’t we Ben? (He nods yes.)
 Rachel: Ohh okay. (Ross has a sign on his back that reads ‘Poop.’) Wh—Ah-ha! (Ross stops and turns.) Wait a minute. Uh Ben I can’t do it.
 Rachel: I can’t let him go out that way he’s got a meeting. (To Ross) You’ve got something here on your back.
 Rachel: Oh I…
 Rachel: No! Wait! Come on!
 Rachel: No you guys… (She walks out into the hallway.)
 Rachel: EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! (She runs over to him and finds that it was a dummy and that she had been had.)
 Rachel: Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
 Rachel: I do the same thing.
 Rachel: I’m just kidding too. (Laughs) I’m getting married in December. (Turns away not happy with herself.)
 Rachel: Oh y’know what? Y’know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman’s and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
 Rachel: So does this (The dress) come in another color or… (The store owner walks away.)
 Rachel: (To Phoebe) So this is Brooklyn.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Oh they’re pushing! They’re pushing!!
 Rachel: Well I…

 Rachel: No! You gotta hold my hand!!
 Rachel: (seeing who’s trapped) Hey…
 Rachel: You’re out of Diet Coke.
 Rachel: You’re out of toilet paper!
 Rachel: Yeah I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh two months later the couple got divorced. And now I’m not saying that there’s any connection here y’know but they did tell me that’s why they got divorced.
 Rachel: Well what is the other reason?
 Rachel: Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid.
 Rachel: (gasps) Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
 Rachel: Oh stop that! Don’t kid about that! (Gasps) Will all the stars be there?
 Rachel: Oh my God! Oh my God! I can’t go! I’m gonna be too nervous!
 Rachel: No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.

 Rachel: So you’ll definitely get onstage even if you don’t win.
 Rachel: Well of course I do! But y’know favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you’re up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
 Rachel: Well Joey you’ll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y’know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y’know? So it’s sorta like… (Does it you’ll have to see it.)
 Rachel: Y’know?
 Rachel: Oh no at the Grammies I always win.
 Rachel: (entering from her room) Whoa what?
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Not right now.
 Rachel: Oh see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in love.

 Rachel: Do you really want an award you didn’t win?
 Rachel: Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
 Rachel: Joey no this is wrong! You have to take it back okay? You don’t want to win an award this way. You’re very talented. And someday you’re gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.

 Rachel: (calmly) Okay. I’m sorry. You’re right you’re right.
 Rachel: Phoebe I already I already did.

 Rachel: (pause) What?
 Rachel: Okay. Okay. All right you take care of that. And meanwhile the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list.
 Rachel: Hey! What’s up Mon?
 Rachel: Have at it.
 Rachel: Are you makin’ him a sandwich?
 Rachel: (To Phoebe after Monica’s gone) We have to get her a present?!
 Rachel: Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Well I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
 Rachel: (to her) Hi! I’m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I’m the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
 Rachel: Ohhhh!
 Rachel: That’s great!
 Rachel: (to the woman) Excuse us for a minute. (They go into the kitchen.) You didn’t tell her to come?!
 Rachel: No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
 Rachel: Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
 Rachel: Oh Monica we are so sorry.
 Rachel: Well first for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
 Rachel: Yeah we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower and now you don’t have either.
 Rachel: Ugh…
 Rachel: What do you what do you mean?
 Rachel: Surprise…
 Rachel: …Monica.
 Rachel: Hey! Out of all of us who do you think is gonna get married next?
 Rachel: (to the gang) Oh my God Melissa Warburton. I don’t think I have the energy for this.
 Rachel: (screaming) Melissa!
 Rachel: Wh—(Turns and looks at the gang who’s staring)—Why don’t I tell you over here? (She walks Melissa away from the gang.)
 Rachel: Oh no-no no! It’s good! It’s all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
 Rachel: I will not! I’m the divisional head of men’s sportswear!
 Rachel: Oh please…
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: Oh tomorrow oh I don’t know. Um…
 Rachel: Shut up.
 Rachel: Oh wow thanks! (Reading the card) Oh you’re in real estate!
 Rachel: Wow! What do you do now?
 Rachel: Okay! (Joins the rest of the gang.)
 Rachel: Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
 Rachel: She’s actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
 Rachel: (To Monica) Yes.
 Rachel: It’s not a big deal!
 Rachel: No we weren’t! It was nothing! It was one night senior year we went to a party had a lot of sangria and y’know ended up…kissing for a bit.
 Rachel: Oh wow. Why don’t we just take me (Grabs her pin) and put me with a Manhattan in my hand talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs. Monica just glares at her.) These pins aren’t for playing are they?
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Stop picturing it!!
 Rachel: That is not a problem.
 Rachel: Oh get out of here! (Jumps back and walks away.)
 Rachel: (motioning to a rack) So now these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there’s anything that you like we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a few) But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
 Rachel: I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me!
 Rachel: Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they’re done with them they just send ‘em back.
 Rachel: Some of them.
 Rachel: Honey might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
 Rachel: Umm well let’s see uh this one is Tom Brokaw.
 Rachel: (reading a tag) This one is uh Paul O’Neil.
 Rachel: He plays for the Yankees. Seriously ESPN! Just once and a while have it on in the background. (Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux) Ooh this one was Pierce Brosnan!
 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: It’s a pretty cool tux.
 Rachel: (entering) Hey!
 Rachel: So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding do you need one?
 Rachel: Well what are you going to wear?
 Rachel: Huh. Does Monica know about this?
 Rachel: Can I please be there when you tell her? (Joey nods yes.)
 Rachel: Oh y’know what? I can’t. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
 Rachel: Well do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey’s lewd version?
 Rachel: Hey come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time…she and I y’know…kissed a little bit.
 Rachel: It-it did!
 Rachel: Yeah it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
 Rachel: Yeah why is it so hard for you to believe?!
 Rachel: I’m not saying that I’m a lesbian! I’m just saying that this happened!
 Rachel: (shocked) Vanilla?!
 Rachel: I’m not vanilla! I’ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
 Rachel: All right y’know what? If you don’t want to believe me about this why don’t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
 Rachel: Oh. Oh that’s great!
 Rachel: (changing the subject) Anyway speaking of drinking too much. I was uh tellin’ Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh we made out.
 Rachel: Remember?! We—come on both had the sarongs on and we had the-the coconut bikini tops…
 Rachel: …we went back the house and we got really silly and we…we made out.
 Rachel: How can you not remember us kissing?!
 Rachel: Wh… Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn’t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin’ together?
 Rachel: Yeah—but come on—Listen I’m sorry I don’t want to make you uncomfortable but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn’t believe me.
 Rachel: No!!
 Rachel: Thank you Phoebe.
 Rachel: It happened! I am telling you it happened!
 Rachel: What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! (She does so.) Okay? Look that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life and I’m not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay so if you don’t remember that maybe you will remember this! (She grabs Melissa and kisses her on the lips.)
 Rachel: (shocked) What?
 Rachel: (moving away) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
 Rachel: (moves away again) I-I-I-I’m just…I’m just a good kisser!
 Rachel: I’m sorry!
 Rachel: Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna…
 Rachel: What the hell was that?!
 Rachel: And?
 Rachel: Well y’know what they say the 23rd time’s the charm. (Chandler enters.) Aww look at you all handsome!
 Rachel: Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
 Rachel: I don’t want to say.
 Rachel: Diane Keeton.
 Rachel: Monica what?
 Rachel: What is the emergency?!
 Rachel: Well I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
 Rachel: Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm maybe you can start with Chandler even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more.
 Rachel: Well y’know sometimes that helps. (She realises what that could’ve meant.)
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Hey what have you guys been up to?
 Rachel: I can’t believe they’ve been together for three years.
 Rachel: I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us.
 Rachel: Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: OH MY GOD!!!
 Rachel: Phoebe!! Phoebe!! Its okay!! Its okay!!
 Rachel: I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
 Rachel: Yes I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesnt know so you have to stop screaming!!

 Rachel: Nothing! Oh God were just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
 Rachel: All right honey wed better go if we wanna catch that movie.
 Rachel: Are you kidding?!
 Rachel: I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey do they know that we know?
 Rachel: Joey!
 Rachel: Ugh I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
 Rachel: Joey look just look at it this way the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
 Rachel: Okay!
 Rachel: You really think it would be that different?
 Rachel: Well things change.
 Rachel: Hey whos this little naked guy?
 Rachel: Aww look at the little thing.
 Rachel: Wow Monica you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
 Rachel: Well we were just talkin’ about you guys gettin’ married and how great it is.
 Rachel: Oh can we read them?
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: (To Monica) Monica will-will you marry me?
 Rachel: Wait a minute! (To Monica) You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you you say you’re the only one who’s allowed to drive it.
 Rachel: (shocked) You let Joey drive it?!
 Rachel: Wow! I can’t believe you lied to me.
 Rachel: Take the top down did ya?
 Rachel: Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she’s talking about! I am an excellent driver!
 Rachel: Well in High School that added up to head cheerleader.
 Rachel: I think she’s checking out your beehive Ross.
 Rachel: Gimme the keys!
 Rachel: Well no brush!
 Rachel: (to the woman) Alimony. (Runs outside.)
 Rachel: Ahhh! (Gets in.) Ooh nice!
 Rachel: My God!
 Rachel: Just washing the windshield. (She turns on the wipers forcing Ross off of the hood.)
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Look Ross if you’re so freaked out just get in the car!
 Rachel: All right. (She starts off.)
 Rachel: What are you doing?! Get in the front!
 Rachel: Oh my…
 Rachel: God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
 Rachel: Oh Ross you’re so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax… (She takes her hands off of the wheel.)
 Rachel: I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
 Rachel: Uh-oh. (She starts to pull over.)
 Rachel: Really? You think so?
 Rachel: Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I’ll go under you go over!
 Rachel: Oh come on Ross!! (She tries to switch places with him and goes under his leg.)
 Rachel: (sexily) Hi officer was I going a little too fast?
 Rachel: Oh yes absolutely! Y’know it’s weird uh but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh…well I probably shouldn’t tell you the rest.
 Rachel: (handing it to him) Yes. Here you go Officer uh Handsome.
 Rachel: Oops sorry my mistake.
 Rachel: Really?! You think so? Y’know I had just rolled out of bed.
 Rachel: Y’know you’re-you’re probably wondering about the old date on there.

 Rachel: I bet you’re a Gemini.
 Rachel: Taurus?
 Rachel: Virgo?
 Rachel: Sagittarius?
 Rachel: I knew it! I knew it ahh….
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: I won’t speed.
 Rachel: I promise.
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Oh well…
 Rachel: Remind me to introduce you to someone!
 Rachel: Fourth gear!!
 Rachel: Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o’clock position.
 Rachel: It’s a different guy!
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: (pause) You have a son!
 Rachel: (checking her watch) Op! We gotta go! (The girls stand up.)
 Rachel: What ‘cha doing Mon?
 Rachel: Hey! Those are all the things I’m responsible for!
 Rachel: The commercial?
 Rachel: Oh that’s great!
 Rachel: Oh wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II not World War I.
 Rachel: You’re gonna be late! Go! Go! (He runs out.)
 Rachel: Mexico?
 Rachel: Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
 Rachel: Yeah! But I don’t know what he looks like!
 Rachel: Man in the black dress… (Monica walks away and Rachel looks around to find a woman in a black dress.) (To her) Hi! I’m Rachel! I’m a friend of Monica and Chandler’s!
 Rachel: Oh I get it! A…man…duh!
 Rachel: I’ll do it.
 Rachel: I said I’ll do it!
 Rachel: Monica! I’m not gonna screw it up!
 Rachel: Well of course that is what I’m here for!
 Rachel: Ugh! (To Phoebe) What grandmother?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: She’s steaming her dress why? What’s up?
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: (reading the note) Tell Monica I’m sorry.
 Rachel: Yeah but maybe it’s not what we think. Maybe it’s tell Monica I’m sorry I…drank the last of the milk.
 Rachel: Okay. Phoebe I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: (closing the door) Ross said there’s still no word from Chandler.
 Rachel: Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
 Rachel: God! Don’t—We can’t let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God but wait she’ll be in the gown and then he won’t show up and then she’s gonna have to take off the gown…
 Rachel: I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It’s just…It’s just so sad!
 Rachel: I know. I know. Oh God. (Looking around) There’s no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Oh thank you! (Wiping her nose.) Oh God! (She throws it out.) Can I have another one?
 Rachel: Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn’t show up!
 Rachel: Oh I mean she’s gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering Oh that poor girl. Y’know? Then she’ll have to come back here and live all alone.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: No she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
 Rachel: Okay Phoebe we can not tell anyone about this.
 Rachel: Okay?
 Rachel: No. Why?
 Rachel: Anything?
 Rachel: All right we’ve got to tell her he’s gone. (Starts to leave.)
 Rachel: Ross she’s gonna start getting ready soon!
 Rachel: All right well how much time do you need?
 Rachel: One hour.
 Rachel: Then why do you ask?!
 Rachel: All right I’ll see you guys later.
 Rachel: I’ll figure something out.
 Rachel: Thanks.
 Rachel: Okay uh but before you do that. I-I I need you to talk to me.
 Rachel: Umm… I’m never gonna getting married!
 Rachel: No Monica! I’m serious! Oh maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
 Rachel: Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
 Rachel: The nights are the hardest. (Checks her watch.) But then the day comes! And that’s every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again…
 Rachel: I know. At dusk. That’s such a hard time for me.
 Rachel: Okay. But wait!
 Rachel: Let’s go to lunch.
 Rachel: Right.
 Rachel: Oh good God! I’ve fallen down! (She trips and falls.)
 Rachel: Okay. All right. (Gets up.) Honey listen. When I tell you what I’m about to tell you I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
 Rachel: We can’t find Chandler…(Phoebe sticks her head and motions that they found Chandler)—‘s vest. We can’t find Chandler’s vest.
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: You look so beautiful.
 Rachel: Hello?
 Rachel: Yeah we got him back. Everything’s fine.
 Rachel: What? Why? Where are you?
 Rachel: Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
 Rachel: Oh my God! I’m gonna have to find another minister.
 Rachel: Ugh! Joey I have to go.
 Rachel: Well Phoebe we gotta do something! (They turn the corner.) Well y’know. I mean there’s no way Joey’s gonna make it in time. So I’m gonna through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding excellent! {It’s a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me they were written on a sign.}(The happy couple emerges.) Congratulations. (To the best man and maid of honor) Mazel Tov! (The rabbi emerges.) Hi! Oh great hat. (He’s wearing an interesting hat and she takes him over to talk.) Listen umm I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
 Rachel: Yeah! Yeah. They’re…they’re-they’re my friends uh Monica Stephanopolus and uh and Chandler Acidofolus.
 Rachel: (leaning in) As are you…
 Rachel: Go on! Go on. (She turns back to Chandler.)
 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: Oh my God who is it?! (Phoebe rolls her eyes.)
 Rachel: For you. (Chandler leaves.)
 Rachel: Oh thank you for doing that. I just can’t deal with this just quite yet.
 Rachel: You said that she was I just didn’t disagree with you.
 Rachel: Oh yeah.
 Rachel: Oh! (They smile and the picture is taken.) Oh by the way?
 Rachel: James Brolin?
 Rachel: Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: No!
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: Ugh! Look honey y’know what? I haven’t told him yet so until I do I don’t think I should tell anybody else.
 Rachel: Phoebe!!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Honey stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
 Rachel: Oh y’know what honey? Let’s not talk about that right now?
 Rachel: Sure but come on as big as your wedding?
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Hey! Y’know sometimes you can do everything right everyone can wear everything they’re supposed to wear and one of those little guys just gets through!
 Rachel: I don’t know! Maybe they have tools.
 Rachel: Well maybe that’s maybe that’s really brave.
 Rachel: Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well.
 Rachel: (starting to cry) I don’t know.
 Rachel: Uh-hmm. I’m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
 Rachel: Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass takes a sip and realizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass without Monica noticing. It doesn’t work.) Oh that’s-that’s actually how the French drink it.
 Rachel: I don’t know. I don’t know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don’t want to make. (Takes another sip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!!
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: How many ways are there to do that?
 Rachel: All right I’ll-I’ll take it again when I get home.
 Rachel: Okay. Thank you.
 Rachel: Oh you guys are so great.
 Rachel: Wh—Hey I just gave you peeing on a stick.
 Rachel: How much longer?
 Rachel: 30 seconds okay.
 Rachel: Oh I know. I know. (They hug.)
 Rachel: Oh wait! Y’know what? I can’t I can’t look at it. I can’t. Somebody else tell me somebody tell me.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! (Pause) That is—that’s great—that is really great-great news. (Pause) Y’know ‘cause the whole not being ready and kinda the financial aspects all that. Whew. Wow this is so just the way it was supposed to be. (Starts to cry.) God.
 Rachel: Thanks. (Crying) God this is so stupid! (Pause) How could I be upset over something I never had? It’s negative?
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Are you sure?
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Oh-oh that’s a risky little game!
 Rachel: Yeah. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby! (They all hug.)
 Rachel: Ah it’s still not the time.
 Rachel: Listen y’know what sir? For the last time I don’t care what the computer says we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!
 Rachel: Are you joking? Check out is not ‘til noon and he has a good (checks her watch) eleven minutes left.
 Rachel: Yeah one time when we were dating uh we got a late checkout he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y’know he screamed out Radisson at the end.
 Rachel: (entering) Hi.
 Rachel: Shh-shh-shh! The guys don’t know yet do they?
 Rachel: Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today.
 Rachel: Ew! No!
 Rachel: Well then you have his baby.
 Rachel: Yeah. Uh-huh I guess it is pretty big news.
 Rachel: Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean I’m not gonna ask him for anything.
 Rachel: Hey Joey what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?
 Rachel: Oh Joey! Joey! No it’s not you! You didn’t get anybody pregnant!
 Rachel: Not yet.
 Rachel: No! Phoebe it’s not Gunther.
 Rachel: Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven’t told him yet and I don’t think I can tell him at all now!
 Rachel: I don’t know let me think. I was walking down the street thinking ‘I’m gonna tell the father today’ and then bam!
 Rachel: No you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!
 Rachel: I know but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn’t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.
 Rachel: What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe how do you even know who the father is?
 Rachel: Oh God… Oh he’s in there right now?
 Rachel: Uh let’s rip!
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe!
 Rachel: Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y’know you do wear that sweater a lot are you involved in some kind of dare?
 Rachel: Oh it’s just not the right time.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Tag…
 Rachel: I’m having a baby.
 Rachel: You can go.
 Rachel: Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
 Rachel: Oh wow you didn’t even try to unhook my bra!
 Rachel: No I will. I’m just not up for it tonight.
 Rachel: I’m not?
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: No! Joey oh you’re so sweet. You’re so-so sweet honey. But I’m not I’m not looking for a husband.
 Rachel: Now if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. (Exits.)

 Rachel: I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon! (Hugs Monica.)
 Rachel: And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. (They all look at her expectantly) What? What? What?
 Rachel: How?! How do you know?
 Rachel: Oh I so wanted Ross to know first but I’m so relieved you guys know.
 Rachel: I know! (They hug.)
 Rachel: (breaking the hug) You’re all gonna be aunts and uncles.
 Rachel: Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I’m gonna tell Ross!
 Rachel: Well I was gonna tell him that I’m-I’m gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
 Rachel: Yeah but how do I start? I mean what’s-what’s the first thing that I say? (They all pause to think.) Okay great! Thanks. (She starts to leave.)

 Rachel: (closes her magazine) Can I get you some water?
 Rachel: Ross there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want. (Ross nods.)
 Rachel: I know. I know but y’know condoms only work like 97% of the time.
 Rachel: They do!
 Rachel: Okay Ross come on let’s just forget about the condoms.

 Rachel: No I don’t see it!
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: That’s it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh thank you.
 Rachel: Wow! I can’t believe that’s our baby.

 Rachel: Oh no I know I couldn’t see it either at first but it’s right umm… (Starts to cry) Ross I lost it again.
 Rachel: Hi!

 Rachel: So uh apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
 Rachel: It was an amazing night.
 Rachel: You think it looked amazing?
 Rachel: Yeah me neither. Yet…
 Rachel: Yeah it would be really weird.
 Rachel: Good luck to you.

 Rachel: You don’t know do you?
 Rachel: Oh! (Motions to Joey’s co-star.)
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: Well Joey probably thinks I’ll just embarrass him. Y’know he thinks I’m some kind of a soap opera nut—Which I’m not! I’m not. Although I do know that your uh your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. (Starts stroking his arm) And uh and that your-your dog’s name is Wally. Well look at that I’m just stroking your arm.
 Rachel: Oh we’re leaving. Bye Kash.

 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: I thought I was a complete idiot.
 Rachel: Oh! Oh I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Okay Joey first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
 Rachel: Good-good don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay?
 Rachel: Okay you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more actors! I’ll meet ‘em all!
 Rachel: Hey what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. Umm I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon or I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Oh no I can’t. I got a date.
 Rachel: Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
 Rachel: Yeah—Ooh! Earrings! (Goes into her room.)
 Rachel: (entering from her room) Hey guys do you think this is too slutty—Hi Kash!
 Rachel: Yeah! All right I’ll see you guys later.
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Well I’m alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars what do you think?
 Rachel: I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
 Rachel: Well better than you but y’know still not what you want.
 Rachel: He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh Yeah I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch.
 Rachel: Doesn’t he?
 Rachel: Yes.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: (thinks then gasps) Chandler M. Bing?
 Rachel: Oh my God. (Laughs)
 Rachel: Oh it’s all right. I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing. It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different. This is hard.
 Rachel: Thanks sweetie.
 Rachel: Oh no I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
 Rachel: Oh you did there are twenty in here.
 Rachel: Good night.
 Rachel: Please tell me you’re not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it because soon she won’t be able to fit into it.
 Rachel: Ahh!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids right now. Y’know ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal instincts.
 Rachel: (to them) Just a minute!!! (She takes the candy and opens the door to two parents a witch a clown and a cowgirl.) Look at you guys! Wow! You are a very scary witch. (Gives her candy.)
 Rachel: And you are a very funny clown. (Gives him candy.)
 Rachel: (to the cowgirl) And you are so in style right now. Y’know I work at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. I don’t suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue but…
 Rachel: Yeah. Sure. (Throws some in her bag and she walks away as Phoebe dressed as Supergirl walks up and eyes Monica who eyes her back.)
 Rachel: (To Monica) Oh you did this to him?
 Rachel: Oh! (Opens the door to reveal a ballerina) Well you’re just the prettiest ballerina I’ve ever seen.
 Rachel: Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.
 Rachel: Well I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.
 Rachel: Ohh… Oh honey here. Take it all. (Pours the entire large bowl into her bag and closes the door.) Monica! We need more candy?
 Rachel: Yeah I know but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave her everything.
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Hi! Y’know what honey we’re actually out of candy right now. But someone just went out to get some and I have been giving out money but I’m out of that too. Hey can I write you a check?
 Rachel: Okay what’s your name?
 Rachel: Okay I’m just gonna write this out to cash.
 Rachel: Hey Mona!
 Rachel: Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet.
 Rachel: Honey someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.
 Rachel: Gotta go! (Opens the door to a boy in a cape.) Hi! Wow! There you go! (Hands him some candy.)
 Rachel: Oh yeah we were but umm now we’ve got candy.
 Rachel: Well that-that’s not your choice. Happy Halloween!
 Rachel: Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff?
 Rachel: You shut up!
 Rachel: Uh I think I just did. And uh-oh here it comes again. Shut up!
 Rachel: (To Joey) Yeah I know—I’m good—I got it! (Joey slowly backs away.) (To the boy) Now wait a minute I’ve got one more thing I have to say to you…oh right! Shut up!
 Rachel: No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook! (Grabs her checkbook and runs after him.)
 Rachel: Hey! Well I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
 Rachel: No I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh I am just awful with children!
 Rachel: Really? You think that’s all it is?
 Rachel: Wow! What did he do?
 Rachel: I can’t. I’m busy. I’m apartment hunting.
 Rachel: Yeah I can’t live with Joey once the baby comes. I don’t want my child’s first words to be (in a baby’s voice) How you doin’?
 Rachel: Well I haven’t discussed it with him yet but I know he’s gonna be relieved. Last week he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
 Rachel: Not so much.
 Rachel: Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
 Rachel: Yeah that would really be great.
 Rachel: Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn’t. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.
 Rachel: Shall we?
 Rachel: And I’m Rachel an admirer of the building.
 Rachel: Ahh.
 Rachel: So she’s really not dead.
 Rachel: Hmm. Do you think—Could you tell me if she’s hanging in in a one bedroom or a two?
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: How was the game?
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.
 Rachel: Oh but Joey I have to go. There’s no room for a baby here.
 Rachel: Honey it’s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there’s a screaming baby around.
 Rachel: Honey it’s so sweet that you want me to stay but I-I can’t do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
 Rachel: I know.
 Rachel: I do too a little bit.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: You gave them to me!
 Rachel: All right I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.
 Rachel: What bra?
 Rachel: You mean the one that you’re wearing? (Adjusts Monica’s pink bra strap as Monica looks down her shirt.)
 Rachel: What is this?
 Rachel: You’re so sweet. (Notices something in the crib.) Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy! (A stuffed penguin wearing a ski jacket goggles and hat.)
 Rachel: But Joey the baby is going to be crying it’s going to be loud.
 Rachel: It’s gonna be up all night!
 Rachel: It’s gonna poop!
 Rachel: What about all the women you want to bring home?
 Rachel: Joey are you sure?
 Rachel: I want me to stay too.
 Rachel: Thank you. (They hug.) Oh Joey and look at this crib! It’s so cute!
 Rachel: Are you serious—Really?! It’s in such good condition.
 Rachel: Wow! Whoa-whoa what’s under the covers?
 Rachel: It’s moving.
 Rachel: It’s still—(Screams)—It’s got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
 Rachel: Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I’m gonna stay here.
 Rachel: (coming from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs?
 Rachel: I’m having dinner with my dad tomorrow night do you wanna come?
 Rachel: Oh no no I’ll be there too.
 Rachel: No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven’t told him I’m pregnant yet.
 Rachel: ‘Cause I know he’s gonna flip out and I hate it when he’s angry.
 Rachel: What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he’d make me eat the entire pack.
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: (panicking) No you don’t.
 Rachel: Well you could’ve untied it with your hands.
 Rachel: Well actually umm…
 Rachel: (To Phoebe) In case you didn’t notice that is a scary man.
 Rachel: This was such a huge mistake. I can’t tell him Phoebe. I can’t I can’t I can’t I can’t…
 Rachel: No it’s okay this is what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.
 Rachel: Hey that is the…baby’s problem. (Dr. Green returns.) Oh everything okay with the waiter?
 Rachel: Well… Umm I got TiVo.
 Rachel: Phoebe!
 Rachel: Well uh yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up yeah.
 Rachel: No it’s Ross. It’s Ross. You like Ross. (He just shakes his head.) Oh daddy I hope you’re okay with all of this. I mean think about it this is a good thing. You’re gonna—This is your first grandchild! You’re gonna be a poppy!
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Who?
 Rachel: February 2nd!
 Rachel: I know. I know. I panicked I panicked. I didn’t want him to start yelling at me like I was some ’74 Latour.
 Rachel: All right here he comes. I’m gonna do this I’m gonna tell him I’m gonna be strong.
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! (Hugs him and Phoebe glares at her.) Right. Daddy I need to talk to you. Please sit down.
 Rachel: There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
 Rachel: I’m sorry daddy.
 Rachel: Oh now daddy stay calm. Please.
 Rachel: Yes. Yes he says I’m damaged goods.
 Rachel: (quietly) Oh no…
 Rachel: Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person or via e-mail.
 Rachel: Oh okay I’ll fix that to. What’s her e-mail address?
 Rachel: All right I promise. I’ll fix this. I swear. I’ll-I’ll-I’ll-I’ll talk to her.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: I know Mona just hear me out. First of all I’m so sorry about my father yelling at you but I heard you totally held your own. You’re gonna have to tell me how you did that.
 Rachel: Okay. Um…But—Okay yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.
 Rachel: Oh we just—we drove each other crazy!
 Rachel: I mean he was possessive he was jealous he could never just let the little things go!
 Rachel: Right! But none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is. (Rubbing his shoulder.)
 Rachel: I know I get it but Mona what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? (Mona looks at her.) I am so gonna leave right now. (Ross opens the door for her and she leaves.)
 Rachel: (entering) Forgot my purse! (Sees them kissing.) Oh you guys made up. (To Mona) He’s a good kisser isn’t he? (Ross goes to close the door on her.) I’m going! (Quickly leaves and Ross locks the door.)
 Rachel: About an hour ago.
 Rachel: Yes! (She gets up and sets the phone on the counter without hanging it up.) Bye daddy. (Phoebe and her leave.)
 Rachel: (looking at her fingers) Oh my…God! Let me see that! (Grabs the book from him.)
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Oh Pheebs that’s so sweet—(Grabs a pair of pants)—Ooh those are so cute!
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: Wow! I don’t remember him. Honey are you sure you’re not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
 Rachel: Oh that’s nice.
 Rachel: Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
 Rachel: (entering carrying a baking dish) Hi!
 Rachel: (sees Will) Oh my God Monica who is that?
 Rachel: Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! Hes really got that sexy smoldering thing going on. (We see Will angrily staring at Rachel.) Oh my God he’s… Look at the way he’s just staring at me. I think he’s trying to mouth something to me but I can’t make it out. (Will mouths I hate you.)
 Rachel: Hi! Will right?
 Rachel: Hi! I’m Rachel Green.
 Rachel: Really?! Aren’t you sweet! I gotta tell you though I am I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm did we fool around at Lance Davis’ graduation party?
 Rachel: Thank you!

 Rachel: Umm I’m sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?
 Rachel: I’m-I’m—I had no idea. I’m sorry. I…
 Rachel: Uh Will umm I just want to say that I’m real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school…
 Rachel: You had a club?!
 Rachel: Whoa! My God! So what you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?
 Rachel: (To Ross) So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
 Rachel: So who else was in this club?

 Rachel: Okay Monica did you know about this?!
 Rachel: Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?
 Rachel: What rumor?
 Rachel: Ross!
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: (shocked) Oh my God!
 Rachel: What?! You heard that?! (Goes and stands behind Joey.)
 Rachel: Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn’t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region! (Motions to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.)
 Rachel: Monica how come you never told me this?!
 Rachel: Joey stop staring! There’s nothing there! It’s not true!
 Rachel: Oh! (Hits him and storms out.)
 Rachel: (entering carrying a book) Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year Dear Rach you’re such a good person. Not girl! Person!

 Rachel: Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
 Rachel: Ohh there’s a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
 Rachel: Wh—Phoebe!!
 Rachel: All right y’know—Fine! You guys have your stupid little club but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie! (Will laughs.)
 Rachel: Wow…
 Rachel: She’s right.
 Rachel: You can keep those pants by the way.
 Rachel: (entering) Hi!
 Rachel: Oh my God! (Notices the boots) Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
 Rachel: Return them?! Shh! They’re gonna hear you!
 Rachel: (pause) He’s talking to the baby.
 Rachel: Okay. Well I gotta go you guys. I’ll see you later.
 Rachel: Bye. (She gets up to leave but is stopped by Joey)
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: No forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.
 Rachel: I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors…
 Rachel: Really?! Oh my God! I’m successful!
 Rachel: Yes! I’d love to! Have her come by the office.

 Rachel: Oh Joey I’m hardly a…
 Rachel: Right! Hi Dina!
 Rachel: Nice to meet you. (They shake hands.)
 Rachel: Okay. All right Dina well let’s talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let’s see there’s design but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh there’s-there’s sales which is great because you get to travel…
 Rachel: (stunned) And there’s marketing…
 Rachel: Honey it’s going to be okay. He’s been incredibly supportive of me and if he gets a little upset; that’s what the meatball sub is for. (She gives Dina a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil.)
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Honey why don’t you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
 Rachel: Joey…there’s something that you…should know. Dina?
 Rachel: (To Dina) Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! (She quickly sets the sandwich in front of him.)
 Rachel: What?! Dina…
 Rachel: I know.
 Rachel: What college was that Dina?
 Rachel: Joey what are you doing?
 Rachel: Oh Joey this is crazy!
 Rachel: All right Joey! That is enough! (Grabs him and pulls him away from Bobby and Dina) Listen as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is it’s not legal. Okay? They-they don’t have a marriage license they don’t have any witnesses and the groom only has on one shoe!
 Rachel: You’re supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.
 Rachel: Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! (To Bobby and Dina) Right?
 Rachel: Oh come on kids! A little help here!
 Rachel: Joey just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!
 Rachel: Hey now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby why don’t you tell us a little bit about your band?
 Rachel: (To Dina) Really? (Nods her head at Bobby.)
 Rachel: Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
 Rachel: So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
 Rachel: Okay Bobby why don’t we just come over here and let them have a little moment. (Drags Bobby away from Joey and Dina.)
 Rachel: No! Seriously! What’s wrong with you?!
 Rachel: Phoebe?
 Rachel: Look at that guy by the window wow!
 Rachel: Oh what is wrong with me lately? I mean it’s like every guy I see—I mean look here. (Points behind them) Look at that guy for example I mean normally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to but right now with the way I’m feeling all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Really?! So this has happened to you?
 Rachel: Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend I went from store to store sitting on Santa’s lap.
 Rachel: Ah.
 Rachel: Well y’know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow I’ll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Oh okay. Hey can I ask you a question? Was it me or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y’know who I’m talking about bald haircut hairy fingers… (Stops when she realizes it was her.)
 Rachel: Yes you are.
 Rachel: Oh really really good. But enough about me come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?
 Rachel: Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?
 Rachel: Oh I love to ski! How amazing is this?!
 Rachel: No. I’m very comfortable.
 Rachel: No! Shoot Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
 Rachel: Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
 Rachel: Do you feel it too?
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: Well let’s see. Uh they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.
 Rachel: Okay even this is turning me on!
 Rachel: Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it how’s it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?
 Rachel: Uh Ross? You asked me that.
 Rachel: I think if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.
 Rachel: You gave her a key to your apartment?!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Yeah. (They go into the kitchen.)
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Phoebe no!
 Rachel: No! I do not care what my hormones are doing I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
 Rachel: Yes. Hi I’d like to order a pizza. Okay can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. (Joey enters.) I’ll call you back.
 Rachel: It’s just the pizza place.
 Rachel: I’m sorry honey I’m just having a having a rough day.
 Rachel: Oh you really you really just don’t want to hear about it.
 Rachel: Okay it’s just—and this is really embarrassing—but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I’m just finding myself…how do I put this umm erotically charged.
 Rachel: Yeah. So y’know I have all of these feelings and I don’t know what to do about them because I can’t date like a normal person which is fine because I don’t need a relationship I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex y’know? No strings attached no relationship just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he’s doing. For just one great night I mean is that really so…hard…to find. (Looks at Joey.) So how was your day?
 Rachel: Well I gotta get up early and it’s almost seven o’clock.
 Rachel: Okay good night!
 Rachel: (entering) I didn’t ask you to do it!
 Rachel: You’re Joey!
 Rachel: Right back at ya!
 Rachel: And so bad. I don’t even know what you’re talking about because I didn’t ask you to do anything!
 Rachel: No!
 Rachel: That’s the end of this conversation!
 Rachel: Never happened! Good night!
 Rachel: They made you head of the department!
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Uh Paul’s Caf�. They got great food and it’s really romantic.
 Rachel: Yeah! Oh and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing—Oh! Take her dancing!
 Rachel: Ooh I miss dating. Gettin’ all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I’m not gonna be able to do that for so long and it’s so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
 Rachel: Huh?
 Rachel: What?! Joey you don’t want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
 Rachel: (interrupting) Okay! I’ll go with ya! I’ll go! I’ll go with ya.
 Rachel: All right?
 Rachel: Joey? Could you get that? (There is no answer and she goes and opens the door to Joey.) What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
 Rachel: Ohh Lilies. Joey they’re my favorite. Thank you.
 Rachel: Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I’m going on a real date! Although I have a hint of morning sickness and I’m wearing underwear that goes up to about…(She snaps the waistband on her underwear that is just slightly below her breasts)…there.
 Rachel: Yeah actually that’s my roommate’s.
 Rachel: Ah yes but he’s very protective of me so you’d better watch yourself.
 Rachel: Hm-mmm.
 Rachel: (laughs) Yeah but I’m pretty sure he’s gay.
 Rachel: Now the filet mignon what comes with that?
 Rachel: Emmm. Now instead of the vegetables is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?
 Rachel: Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date—Oh I almost forgot. I didn’t pay you the rent check.
 Rachel: Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?
 Rachel: I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
 Rachel: Oh my God. And that works?!
 Rachel: Oh you poor little famous man.
 Rachel: (looks interested) Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic I almost leaned in. I really almost did!
 Rachel: Alright. So where’d you grow up?
 Rachel: Come on just answer the question!
 Rachel: And so were-were you close to your parents?
 Rachel: Why not?
 Rachel: (sympathetic) Oh. (Starts rubbing his wrist with her fingers.) It’s gotta be rough.
 Rachel: Huh?
 Rachel: Thank you! And now if you’ll excuse me I have to go to the rest room.
 Rachel: And now you’re watching me walk away.
 Rachel: I am not gonna answer that!
 Rachel: No one! They are my friends I wouldn’t punch any of them.
 Rachel: Yeah but I don’t know why. Look at me I’m having such a wonderful time!
 Rachel: I know!
 Rachel: Joey I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
 Rachel: Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
 Rachel: All right now don’t judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves but you live here. I’m ripping into this swan.
 Rachel: So tell me what are Joey Tribbiani’s end of the night moves?
 Rachel: How do you do that?
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: No I don’t want to tell you.
 Rachel: Because it’s embarrassing.
 Rachel: (laughs) Okay. All right stand up. (They do so.) Well when we’re at the door I lightly press my lips against his and then move into his body just for a second and then I make this sound Hmmm. Okay I know it doesn’t sound like anything but I swear it works.
 Rachel: All right I gotta go to bed. Honey I had such a wonderful time.
 Rachel: …you were 50 minutes late to the class what did you crawl there?!
 Rachel: Well why didn’t you just take a cab?
 Rachel: Well you’re not gonna be able to keep doing this.
 Rachel: You what?
 Rachel: Right. Wow!
 Rachel: Hi! Hey remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?
 Rachel: Relax! It’s not like it’s Citizen Kane!
 Rachel: Yeah I know it’s really boring but it’s like a big deal. Anyway I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.
 Rachel: Well don’t you have that big date tonight?
 Rachel: Hey Joey can I ask you something?
 Rachel: After our date last night did you feel a little weird?
 Rachel: I don’t know! (Pause) I’m-I’m kinda thinking it-it was the lobster…
 Rachel: Yeah I mean I was up sick all night.
 Rachel: Really?! How come we didn’t cross paths?
 Rachel: Oh God! Thank God you’re home! I’m watching Cujo.
 Rachel: Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
 Rachel: No! No! Seriously what’s wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?
 Rachel: Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
 Rachel: Y’know I never thought I’d say this about a movie but I really hope this dog dies. (Joey brings over a stool at sits on it next to Rachel who’s in the big chair.) What are you doing over there? Come sit here you protect me.
 Rachel: Okay. (Pushes play.) Okay that’s him! That’s him! That’s Cujo! That’s Cujo!
 Rachel: Oh my God….What’s he gonna do now? I can’t watch! (Drags Joey closer to her and cowers into his chest.) Oh. Seriously how can you watch this? Aren’t you scared?
 Rachel: (coming from her room) Hi sweetie.
 Rachel: Hi! Oh Ross don’t forget we have that doctor’s appointment tomorrow!
 Rachel: Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
 Rachel: Popular.
 Rachel: Oh yeah! I’ve come up with a bunch of ideas!
 Rachel: Really?!
 Rachel: Okay! I was thinking if it’s a girl how about Sandrine? It’s French.
 Rachel: Okay fine what do you have?
 Rachel: Wow oh my God our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
 Rachel: I’m really really not.
 Rachel: All right.
 Rachel: Yeah! I don’t think you’re going to need it though. Okay check this out. If it’s a girl Rain.
 Rachel: Why?
 Rachel: Ross why do you hate our child?
 Rachel: Okay James.
 Rachel: But only if it’s a girl.
 Rachel: Oh! I’m sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
 Rachel: Veto. Sawyer?
 Rachel: Veto.
 Rachel: Oh oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
 Rachel: But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it’s a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?
 Rachel: Right. Right.
 Rachel: (looking at the bulletin board with baby pictures) So which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
 Rachel: Third one from the left?
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: I didn’t!
 Rachel: Okay fine I did. But I didn’t see anything I swear.
 Rachel: Okay but Ross just listen to me…
 Rachel: But I couldn’t even if I wanted to because I don’t know! I swear; I didn’t see anything and I don’t want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.
 Rachel: (holding stomach) Okay a couple months late on the lecture Ross.
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: You know what? I’ve been thinking about it. I’m really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
 Rachel: I didn’t see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
 Rachel: I would—Sequoia?
 Rachel: Fine.
 Rachel: But Ross you want the name Ruth!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Ross I swear I don’t know.
 Rachel: A what?!
 Rachel: We’re having a girl?
 Rachel: That’s what you just said!
 Rachel: You said girl!
 Rachel: I’m not! We’re having a girl! Sometimes I can’t believe it’s with you—But still! We’re having a girl!
 Rachel: Oh yes! We’ll have ourselves a little baby Ruth…
 Rachel: Yes please.
 Rachel: (entering) Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? (Looks at Chandler) Oh my! (Covers the spot where Joey wants bubbles to be replaced.)
 Rachel: No I was waiting for you!
 Rachel: We’re having a girl.
 Rachel: (entering) Hi sweetie.
 Rachel: Oh Joey I’m so happy things worked out for us that we’re having this baby together. I love you so much.
 Rachel: And I hope it’s not an inappropriate time to say this but you’re the best sex I ever had.
 Rachel: (bursts into the room) Joey! Joey!
 Rachel: Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
 Rachel: Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!
 Rachel: Yes!
 Rachel: Oh okay! (She goes over to him and he feels her belly.)
 Rachel: Aw it’s unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh she’s like umm…oh…who’s that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
 Rachel: Mia Hamm!
 Rachel: (looking down) Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
 Rachel: It’s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do (Mimics him) that again.
 Rachel: Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey’s room and he was sleeping…
 Rachel: Joey. Joey something feels weird and not good weird. I don’t—Whoa!! (Winces in pain.)
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Okay. Oh God—Ow!—Oo!
 Rachel: Hmm mild discomfort. So I take it you’ve had one of these Braxton thingies?
 Rachel: Thank you doctor. (Dr. Long exits.) (To Joey) Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
 Rachel: But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
 Rachel: But I—But everything is okay. I’m fine!
 Rachel: Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterus though. Mild discomfort what’s he talking about?
 Rachel: Yeah everything’s fine!
 Rachel: Okay no uterus no opinion.
 Rachel: Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
 Rachel: Oh I gotta go back in there.
 Rachel: No everything’s fine. I just gotta go back…
 Rachel: I-I forgot my underwear. (Ross lets her go.)
 Rachel: Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
 Rachel: Ohh! That’s so sweet of you! Oh yum! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich and starts to get sick.) Did you put pickles on this?
 Rachel: Oh Ross!! (Runs to the bathroom and closes the door.)
 Rachel: Yeah I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?
 Rachel: (entering) Well if anyone is keeping score I no longer eat tuna.
 Rachel: What’s up?
 Rachel: (Gasps) Are you breaking up with us?
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?
 Rachel: But Joey I don’t think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean—(Ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)—Or he does.
 Rachel: But Ross its you and me!
 Rachel: I don’t know. Is it crazy?
 Rachel: Okay let’s do it. I’ll move in.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Hi! Hey Happy Valentine’s Day!
 Rachel: It’s good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages? (to the waitress handing her a cup of coffee) Oh thank you. I’ll see you guys later.
 Rachel: (entering) Hi.
 Rachel: I accidentally packed these with my stuff. (looks at the dog and gasps) Who is this?
 Rachel: (talking with a higher voice and puckered lips…kind of like you do to a baby or...well…a puppy…it’s hard to explain. Just use your imagination!) Oh well you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more but I’ve got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting yes I do. Yes I do. (still talking like that) Bye-bye Joey. Oh I seriously can’t stop it. (exits)
 Rachel: Oh I’ve got big Valentine’s plans! I’ve got my Chinese food on the way and the rest of your saltwater taffy!
 Rachel: Ross we actually watched the documentary together.
 Rachel: Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! (runs to her room to get her money)
 Rachel: (entering) Oh hey Mona!
 Rachel: I’ll be watching TV if anybody needs me. (exits to her room)
 Rachel: I’m not here! That’s just my Chinese food!
 Rachel: You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to get in my sweats and eat this in bed! (exits)
 Rachel: (entering) I’m just going to grab the phone.
 Rachel: Oh I’m sorry! Do you need the phone?
 Rachel: (as Ross enters with a present) But but Mona I live here.
 Rachel: (entering) Hi! I’m so sorry to barge in on your Valentine’s but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.
 Rachel: Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
 Rachel: Well now wait. Now I’m all freaked out. Come on you guys will watch it with me.
 Rachel: C’mon seriously you guys you’re not going to make me watch this alone!
 Rachel: Okay. (watching the tape) Ooh my! (Rachel jumps when the woman starts screaming) Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
 Rachel: Uh! It’s horrible!
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: What? Did her ass explode?!
 Rachel: Oh screw you guys you don’t have to do it!
 Rachel: (thinking) You’re going to have a baby and you need to be prepared. Now you’re going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it! (Rachel puts the tape in the VCR)
 Rachel: (thinking) Hmm…maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
 Rachel: Oh-oh! Okay she’s kicking!
 Rachel: Whoa!!
 Rachel: Wow that was a big one.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.
 Rachel: (To Phoebe) Well what’s he like?!
 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: Of course of course.
 Rachel: Oh sure. Older?
 Rachel: Oh I was just gonna ask!
 Rachel: Oh it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.
 Rachel: Joey? What’s up?
 Rachel: Okay what’s up?
 Rachel: Well honey I’m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
 Rachel: Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay? (Walks away.)
 Rachel: …and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I’m really worried the baby’s not going to like him. (Joey is staring at the table.) Are you okay?
 Rachel: No. Not-not for me but why don’t you take off your sweater?
 Rachel: Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
 Rachel: Huh. Wow I wouldn’t think Hobbs would like that so much.
 Rachel: Um seven…e-e-eight eight years. Wow.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: So you were saying?
 Rachel: Okay well you had asked me how long we had known each other and I said Eight years. And the um waiter came over and cut his tip in half and umm…now here we are.
 Rachel: (stunned) What?
 Rachel: (looking around) Who are you talking too? Oh you’re kidding! Oh it’s a joke! (Laughs.) It’s funny. It’s funny. I don’t get it. (Joey doesn’t say any thing and Rachel realizes it’s not a joke.) Oh. (Pause) Okay. Umm… I-I…uh wow. Are you uh… How did umm… When?
 Rachel: Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow it is hot in here.
 Rachel: Joey Joey I love you so much but I…
 Rachel: Joey.
 Rachel: No! Joey please! Please don’t! Please don’t leave like this! Now come on you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! (Starts to cry.)
 Rachel: Can I? (Hug him.)
 Rachel: Oh Joey honey I don’t…I don’t want to lose…
 Rachel: I’m so sorry.
 Rachel: Yeah that was a real good one.
 Rachel: Joey? Are you in there?
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Is Joey here?
 Rachel: Well at least you make each other laugh.
 Rachel: Well I haven’t seen him since that night that he told me how he y’know… I don’t know I think he’s avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?
 Rachel: Ew was Chandler naked? Sort of like a like a ring toss kind of situation?
 Rachel: All right. Well listen if you see Joey will you just tell him uh…tell him I miss him. (Exits and Joey enters.)
 Rachel: Okay I’m done. Do mine.
 Rachel: Ah.
 Rachel: Well I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
 Rachel: Well just ask Mona to give it back!
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out but it’s not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.
 Rachel: How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!
 Rachel: Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!
 Rachel: Oh yeah. That makes sense.
 Rachel: Ooh I can do that.
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Yeah it’s umm… Yeah it’s uh… It-it’s y’know—It’s nothing.
 Rachel: Yeah—No wait! Joey no wait it is. It’s something. It’s-it’s umm…it’s my boss.
 Rachel: Yeah and umm my baby.
 Rachel: My boss wants to buy my baby!
 Rachel: I know I told you it’s a really big problem.
 Rachel: Can you believe that?!
 Rachel: That’s what I told him!
 Rachel: Well I’ll tell ya! (Pause) See uh my-my boss and his wife—They-they can’t have children. So umm and that—we were at the Christmas party and he got drunk and he said to me Rachel I want to buy your baby.
 Rachel: Ohh! Yeah! (Pause) Yeah that-that would’ve been a much simpler problem.
 Rachel: (entering) Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
 Rachel: Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
 Rachel: Oh that’s not important. The point is I really—I think everything’s gonna be okay.
 Rachel: Hey! Oh Joey honey listen thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.
 Rachel: (worried) What?
 Rachel: Whoa-whoa-whoa let’s say more!
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: No! No no-no-no Joey he doesn’t want to buy my baby! I made that up!
 Rachel: So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn’t be awkward!
 Rachel: (To Joey) I can’t believe that you yelled at my boss! I’m-I’m gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
 Rachel: Oh Joey I can’t believe you brought my boss into this! I’m gonna get fired!
 Rachel: Well she told me too! (Points to Monica and Joey glares at her.)
 Rachel: Morning. You wanted to see me?
 Rachel: Okay look Mr. Zelner…
 Rachel: Yeah. (Motions for him to continue.)
 Rachel: Oh God.
 Rachel: Well as long as we are clear about that. (Exits smugly.)
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: It’s all gonna be okay. They’re just so happy that I’m not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.
 Rachel: Chandler can you give us a minute?
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Joey I’m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things…
 Rachel: It kinda worked. I mean y’know I don’t know about you buy I haven’t thought about our thing since all this.
 Rachel: Yeah I know! I miss that.
 Rachel: My gynecologist tried to kill me.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Hey do you guys have any extra ribbon?
 Rachel: I uh think you already are.
 Rachel: Yeah yeah I like him a lot.
 Rachel: Yeah otherwise I’m not going.
 Rachel: This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?
 Rachel: Hmmm….
 Rachel: Thank you…we’re so excited
 Rachel: Yeah if you’re going to do the ears you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.
 Rachel: No I know I don’t either but ya know what it’s their party and it’s just one night. And we don’t even have to lie; we just won’t say anything. If it comes up again we’ll just…smile. We’ll nod along.
 Rachel: Oh…
 Rachel: (looking at the check) Unbelievable!
 Rachel: Open it! Open it! Open it!
 Rachel: But it was beautiful. I mean it was small but kind of spectacular.
 Rachel: On a cliff in Barbados at sunset and Stevie Wonder sang Isn’t She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.
 Rachel: Yeah Stevie’s an old family friend. (Hits Ross’s chest)
 Rachel: So would I. You wouldn’t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.
 Rachel: What? I’m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.
 Rachel: Okay Ross it has to be realistic.
 Rachel: And my veil was lace made by blind Belgium nuns.
 Rachel: Well not at first but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight it was all worth it.
 Rachel: Well I don’t know about that but some said that I looked like a floating angel.
 Rachel: Oh yeah. That’s a great story.
 Rachel: Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
 Rachel: And the ring was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!
 Rachel: Ross it just wouldn’t have been feasible.
 Rachel: It was really fun being married to you tonight.
 Rachel: Okay Ross can I uh can I ask you something?
 Rachel: That proposal at the planetarium…
 Rachel: Are you kidding?! With the with the lilies and-and the song and the stars! It was…really wonderful! Did you just make that up?
 Rachel: Well that would’ve been very hard to say no too.
 Rachel: Goodnight
 Rachel: I will think about it.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: So I’m in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle and guess who the clue is for three down. (She hands the magazine to Joey.)
 Rachel: So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?
 Rachel: Oh come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention oh I don’t know gal pal Rachel Green?
 Rachel: Okay don’t listen to him. Please?
 Rachel: Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. (Excited) Ha-ha! I’m gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. (Looks at Joey.) Seriously proud of you.
 Rachel: Oh yeah I’d actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
 Rachel: That is the Coast Guard.
 Rachel: It’s a trifle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers then a layer of jam then custard which I made from scratch. [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries more ladyfingers then beef saut�ed with peas and onions [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then a little more custard and then bananas and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
 Rachel: Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!
 Rachel: Hey come on now!
 Rachel: (interrupting him) Hi! I’m gal pal Rachel Green and if you want the dirt I’m the one you come too. This might be Joey’s baby (rubbing her stomach) who knows? I’m just kidding—Seriously (leans into the cassette recorder Shelley is using) gal pal Rachel Green.
 Rachel: (scoffs at him) Yeah that’s gonna get you into Soap Opera Digest. Well I…(leans into the microphone again)…I would just like to say that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.
 Rachel: You too!
 Rachel: Oh Joey! Sorry!
 Rachel: Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: I’ve never lived like this before.
 Rachel: Oh my God Jill!
 Rachel: This is Chandler. (Points at him.)
 Rachel: And you know Monica and Ross!
 Rachel: And that’s Phoebe (points) and that’s Joey.
 Rachel: Don’t!! (Joey backs away frightened.)
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Wow! I can’t believe they didn’t put it in the part where you said you didn’t watch soap operas.
 Rachel: (entering) Hi!
 Rachel: So what’s the final head count on my baby shower?
 Rachel: What?! You mean they’re not coming to a social event where there’s no men and there’s no booze?! That’s shocking! I don’t care as long as my mom’s here.
 Rachel: What?! My mom’s not gonna be here?!
 Rachel: My God!
 Rachel: So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
 Rachel: Please make sure she comes. It’s really important to me I mean it’s my mom!
 Rachel: I don’t know.
 Rachel: Okay. (Mrs. Green helps her up and they walk over and get some tea.)
 Rachel: Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh I don’t even have a housekeeper.
 Rachel: Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it tu madre es loca. (I think that’s your mother’s crazy.)
 Rachel: Well however great she was I just can’t afford that.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Wh-wh-what? What?
 Rachel: Yes. Yes I do.
 Rachel: Why did you invite my mother?!
 Rachel: She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
 Rachel: Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother but my God a long lunch with her is taxing.
 Rachel: What? You guys come on! What am I going to do?
 Rachel: You’re right. You’re right. I mean I’m about to have a baby I can tell my mother that I don’t want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She’s gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!
 Rachel: Okay. (She goes over to tell her mother.)
 Rachel: Mom that’s okay that you didn’t get you a gift!
 Rachel: Oh yeah. Okay see mom the truth is I can do this on my own.
 Rachel: But mom I really know what I’m doing. I can handle this.
 Rachel: He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
 Rachel: Wow!
 Rachel: Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh I know what this is! (She’s holding an item with a large suction cup connected to a yellow plastic box with a long narrow tube and bottle connected the yellow part.) Wait a minute. That can’t be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?
 Rachel: Did I say I was done guessing? Okay thank you for that. Oh wow! What’s this?
 Rachel: Oh it dispenses clean diapers!
 Rachel: Well that’s gross why don’t you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?
 Rachel: What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!
 Rachel: I don’t know I’d leave it on the changing table? (Everyone gasps.) What?! What’d I do? What’d I do?!
 Rachel: Oh come—(Stutters)—Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would—she wouldn’t be safe as she would be with me the baby dummy. Oh God okay. Y’know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm I’m just gonna maybe open them a little bit later but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts and this basket is beautiful.
 Rachel: Okay mommy don’t ever leave me. (Hugs her.)
 Rachel: So umm you’re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
 Rachel: Oh mom I swear I’m not an idiot. I’ve read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth but I-I just didn’t think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby’s coming and I don’t know what to do. Oh can I throw up in my diaper genie?
 Rachel: Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Oh we did but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
 Rachel: No. She’s going to live with us for eight weeks.
 Rachel: Yes! She’s gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. (Sees that Ross isn’t happy.)
 Rachel: I do. I really do. I don’t know anything.
 Rachel: Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
 Rachel: Hello?! I still don’t know what the hell I’m doing!
 Rachel: I hope you’re going somewhere with this.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Thank you. (Hugs him.)
 Rachel: (closing a book) Okay! I’m ready.
 Rachel: Yes I’ve done my studying and I really know my stuff.
 Rachel: Uh put your elbow in it.
 Rachel: Full dry on its back and no loose covers.
 Rachel: Check if it’s wet check if it’s hungry burp it!
 Rachel: A card! A card! I pick a card!
 Rachel: Yeah but y’know what they say Mon There’s no such thing as bad press.
 Rachel: I didn’t write it.
 Rachel: Ross!
 Rachel: I am freaking out!
 Rachel: My due date is in one week!
 Rachel: That is seven days!
 Rachel: (interrupting him) No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!
 Rachel: I’m serious.
 Rachel: Okay. Thank you. That’s great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there’s this really cute shoe store that has like this little…
 Rachel: (stopping him) Oh wait Ross! I’m sorry one more thing!
 Rachel: Umm our situation. Y’know umm what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we’re having this baby together and we live together. Isn’t that isn’t that weird?
 Rachel: I’m just kidding! You can go pee! (He does so in a hurry.)
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: No-no-no! No no no we’re not married.
 Rachel: Oh yeah! Actually that’s one of the reasons why we’re not a couple.
 Rachel: Oh. Oh yeah don’t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he’s a doctor but he’s not.
 Rachel: Oh my God! I’m standing at a cash register holding a credit card and I’m bored.
 Rachel: Hi Pheebs!
 Rachel: Oh it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross almost got something that wasn’t on the list. A whore.
 Rachel: Well we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: You don’t understand! You didn’t see how brazen she was.
 Rachel: No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’s that I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl at Sluts ‘R’ Us!
 Rachel: Oh yeah! You really—You look great.
 Rachel: Chandler I’m not gonna lie to ya but I am gonna run away from you. (Gets up and hurries out.)
 Rachel: All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
 Rachel: Horny bitch. (They both look at her pretending that the dinosaurs she’s holding are arguing.) No! You’re a horny bitch! Noooo! You’re the horny bitch! No! You’re a horny bitch!
 Rachel: So you guys go have a really good time.
 Rachel: So you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.
 Rachel: Oh yeah! Yeah please you guys have fun.
 Rachel: Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic although you missed a button.
 Rachel: Oh okay I see what you’re doing there.
 Rachel: Hi! You’re back from your date!
 Rachel: I’m fine but that’s not important. What’s important is how was she?
 Rachel: Oh uh-huh uh-huh coffee a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
 Rachel: No! No she’s—She was nice. I mean she’s a little slutty but who isn’t?
 Rachel: Of course you did Ross you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!
 Rachel: No! It’s just that Kate bothered me.
 Rachel: There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!
 Rachel: I don’t want you to date her!
 Rachel: Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me but because I don’t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it’s a terrible thing to even think this and it’s completely inappropriate but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I’m very sorry but that is just the way that I feel.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Really? But I’m being so unreasonable.
 Rachel: (starting to cry) Oh Ross thank you. Thank you. (They hug.)
 Rachel: No not really. You’re pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry. (She gets up and starts for the bathroom.)
 Rachel: Yeah. (Stops and starts doing the I-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.)
 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: (pause) Wow! I don’t know maybe. I’m…
 Rachel: (laughs) I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin’ with you too!
 Rachel: Oh no-no-no-no no!
 Rachel: No that’s just—(Laughs)—That’s just ‘cause I’m such a good messer!
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Right! (Heads for the bathroom.)
 Rachel: Well obviously I won’t be able to come for those of you who haven’t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y’know I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you’ve been during this time. I really couldn’t have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part I am really gonna miss being pregnant.
 Rachel: That’s right still no baby! (To Monica Joey and Chandler on the couch) Come on people! Please make some room!
 Rachel: You. Like you haven’t done enough.
 Rachel: God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
 Rachel: (interrupting her) Oh Phoebe that’s a great story. Can you tell it to me when you’re getting me some iced tea? (Phoebe gets up and Rachel groans.) (To the baby) Oh God get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!
 Rachel: Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? ‘Cause I’ll do it.
 Rachel: They sent me home from work. They were like Start your maternity leave now! Just rest get ready for the baby. Well y’know what? Screw ‘em! If they don’t want me there I’ll just hang out with you guys.
 Rachel: (overhearing that) What-what about me?
 Rachel: I don’t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I’m pregnant you think I’m invisible.
 Rachel: Oh I have to pee. If I don’t come out in five minutes it’s because I’ve choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)
 Rachel: (calling from the bathroom) All right who’s turn is it to help me get up!
 Rachel: Oh I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)
 Rachel: In a minute!!!
 Rachel: (entering) All right all right. Let’s go!
 Rachel: No I’m fine.
 Rachel: Ross it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks I am somewhat comfortable.
 Rachel: Oh uh-uh pal! Don’t call me mommy! It’s bad enough you call your own mother that. (He looks at Monica.)
 Rachel: Ross.
 Rachel: Can I ask you something?
 Rachel: When Carol was pregnant with Ben…
 Rachel: …were you this irritating?
 Rachel: Excuse me?!
 Rachel: Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
 Rachel: (silently) Okay. (Pause) Seriously breathe louder Ross! That’s great!
 Rachel: Hi Dr. Long how are you?
 Rachel: She has the drugs!
 Rachel: Okay. (Rachel lies back.)
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Eh just a tad.
 Rachel: Well we are ready to try anything.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Great! We will do all of those.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
 Rachel: Well there is one thing that we haven’t tried but someone thinks that (mimicking Ross) That will open up a can of worms.
 Rachel: Why? Why today?
 Rachel: I’ll take that bet.
 Rachel: Well I’m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!
 Rachel: Oh honey don’t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow’s the day.
 Rachel: Ross I—We tried all the spicy food. It’s not working.
 Rachel: I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
 Rachel: Oh come on Ross why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what’s gonna work! It’s doctor recommended!
 Rachel: Oh come on Ross we’ve done it before we’ll do it again it’ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
 Rachel: Make love? What are you a girl?
 Rachel: But you will you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle y’know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.
 Rachel: Oh I know it. You’re right. That’s not sexy. Oh…Oh! (Drops a fork on the floor.) Whoops! Oh I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it. (Tries too but can’t quite seem to make it.) Oh God!
 Rachel: Come on Ross! I’m miserable here! Come on! You started this now you finish it! Come on wuss make love to me.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Oh wow! What now Ross you’re not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute I know. (Mimics his breathing.) I mean you’d think the damn jalepeno would’ve cleared up your sinuses but no!! That’s not enough… (Ross jumps over and kisses her.) What are you doing?!
 Rachel: (breaking the kiss) Oh God!
 Rachel: Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
 Rachel: Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: I didn’t uh really have time to read this part of the books but do you think we have time to…
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: (deadpan) Yes the hard part is truly over.
 Rachel: Hi! (Ross is stunned.)
 Rachel: Ross you stay here and talk I’m gonna go have a baby.
 Rachel: (interrupting her) Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I’m sorry semi-private? We (Laughs) we asked for a private room.
 Rachel: Okay. Just give us a second. Ross! (They walk away from the desk.)
 Rachel: Give her some money.
 Rachel: They’re not!! Ross they’re just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
 Rachel: (standing up) Okay. Y’know what? I’d have to say I really don’t care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to—Whoa! (She starts a contraction) Oh gosh! Whoa!
 Rachel: Ow! Ow! Contraction. (Sits back down.) Ow-ow! Ow-ow! (Starts breathing heavily.)
 Rachel: Yeah it couldn’t hurt to look.
 Rachel: Oh okay.
 Rachel: Thank you. (Dr. Long exits.) Well I guess we have some time to kill.
 Rachel: Yeah well it looks great!
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: How are you?
 Rachel: Yeah it is.
 Rachel: That’s so sweet.
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Oh no I really don’t want any—(He takes the picture)—Oh! Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross…
 Rachel: Here comes another contraction.
 Rachel: Oh that’s very—Really very-very okay.
 Rachel: (simultaneously as Ross) No I don’t think we’ll be doing that.
 Rachel: Oh. Oh wait no.
 Rachel: No-no-don’t! Don’t leave me here with these people.
 Rachel: No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Oh thank you so much for coming. Ross get in here!
 Rachel: New people.
 Rachel: They’re having their baby! It’s not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
 Rachel: Well they have uh some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm evil bitch and uh sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!
 Rachel: Ooh! Ow!!
 Rachel: Ross.
 Rachel: He’s looking at me.
 Rachel: Ugh is she pregnant yet? She doesn’t need to be; she’ll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross another contraction! (Leans back on Ross for some support.)
 Rachel: Yeah it was.
 Rachel: Dr. Long I’ve been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
 Rachel: Hey y’know what? I’m not waiting! I’m gonna push this baby out! I’m doing it! I mean it’s what? Three centimeters? That’s gotta be like this! (Holds her hands a couple inches apart.)
 Rachel: Oh stupid metric system!
 Rachel: Oh for the love of God!
 Rachel: Oh come on!!
 Rachel: Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women that’s four one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated have come and gone with their babies! I’m next! It’s my turn! It’s only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to sue you! Not this hospital I’m going to sue you! And my husband (Points at Ross) he’s a lawyer!
 Rachel: Go get back on that case honey!
 Rachel: Okay well then bring her in.
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: I get it!
 Rachel: Oh we-we didn’t.
 Rachel: Just tell me how.
 Rachel: Oh hi.
 Rachel: Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
 Rachel: Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?
 Rachel: Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! (Starts another contraction as Dr. Long enters.)
 Rachel: Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: My God. Okay. (Another woman enters.) Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
 Rachel: 3-2-1 oh!!
 Rachel: I can’t. I can’t push anymore I can’t.
 Rachel: Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
 Rachel: Don’t say Oh my God! Oh my God what?
 Rachel: Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?
 Rachel: I’m sorry I can’t!
 Rachel: I can’t!
 Rachel: I can’t. Please you do it for me.
 Rachel: Are you okay?
 Rachel: Oh God!
 Rachel: Oh she’s so tiny. (Starts crying) Where’d she go?
 Rachel: Okay. Well be careful with her she’s really tiny.
 Rachel: Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. (The baby cries.) I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh she’s looking at me. Hi! I know you.
 Rachel: No not yet.
 Rachel: Oh no Baby Girl Geller-Green.
 Rachel: Hello baby girl.
 Rachel: Here. (Hands her to Monica.)
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh nothing I… Sorry I just can’t stop crying.
 Rachel: So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don’t see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God. (Starts to cry harder.)
 Rachel: I was reliving it.
 Rachel: Yeah and y’know what? I love them both so why don’t you just pick one and that’ll be it.
 Rachel: That’s not her name! I’m sorry she just doesn’t feel like an Isabella.
 Rachel: Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
 Rachel: Well what are we going to do?
 Rachel: Well tell us! What are they?
 Rachel: And if it’s a girl?
 Rachel: Oh just tell us! We’re not gonna want it!
 Rachel: (gasps) Emma! (Looks at the baby and starts to cry.) See? I don’t want it.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh honey but you love that name.
 Rachel: Ohhh! (Looks at Aaron and recoils in horror.) Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn’t he?
 Rachel: Oh I’m fine. (Gasps in pain as she sits down.)
 Rachel: Oh I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross.
 Rachel: Well then he gets a divorce it’s Ross!
 Rachel: Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Well… That’s…y’know—That’s—We’ve been alone for the last twenty minutes we’re doing okay. Besides y’know what? I-I—Maybe we won’t be alone ‘cause lately I-I—things have been happening between me and Ross y’know? Right before I went into labor we-we had this kiss. Y’know? So it might be the…the beginning of something.
 Rachel: Uh-huh. (Ross takes off his coat and sets in on a chair.) Y’know what I was I was thinking about?
 Rachel: Umm…that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?
 Rachel: (pause) Right.
 Rachel: No! No of course not. No. That’s why I brought it up. (Pause) They didn’t have any sodas?
 Rachel: That’s all right. (He goes to get her a soda.) And so it begins.
 Rachel: Nothing.
 Rachel: Really it’s nothing. I’m just…
 Rachel: I’ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
 Rachel: Oh please he’ll be with his real family the twins and little miss new boobs.
 Rachel: I’m just saying that y’know someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?
 Rachel: I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
 Rachel: Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
 Rachel: Oh hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They’re right on that chair under Ross’s coat.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Joey.
 Rachel: (seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.
 Rachel: Joey.
 Rachel: (seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.
 Rachel: So uh…I guess we should…make it official huh?
 Rachel: Hey you.
 Rachel: Uh yeah actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
 Rachel: I know I still need to talk to you.
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: Uhh… I think I just got engaged.
 Rachel: Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?
 Rachel: And you really think this is a good idea?
 Rachel: I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.
 Rachel: Really?! Even Ross?
 Rachel: I guess so.
 Rachel: I can’t say that I’m surprised.
 Rachel: Of course! Oh Joey this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey why do you think she won’t take my breast?
 Rachel: Okay sweetie you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.
 Rachel: I’m sorry honey what were you saying?
 Rachel: Oh look she’s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesn’t she look scared?
 Rachel: It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!
 Rachel: Hey. I need to tell you something.
 Rachel: Joey asked me marry him.
 Rachel: Joey proposed to me.
 Rachel: Well I-I said yes.
 Rachel: I know. Days of Our Lives thank you very much.
 Rachel: Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
 Rachel: Sure.

 Rachel: You didn’t propose to me. Joey did.
 Rachel: Uh… You didn’t propose to me Chandler didn’t propose to me but Joey did.
 Rachel: Yes you did!

 Rachel: Well I... you know I-I-I dont know what to say... I mean I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know cause I gotta tell you Ross it not like you just came in from branding cattle.
 Rachel: Okay what? What is too sensitive? (Theres music coming from the living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and he and Rachel see Sandy play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved by this but Ross only sees his point proven again and walks back into the kitchen angrily. The door he was holding swings back and hits Rachel.)
 Rachel: That was kind of rude!
 Rachel: You know he was just doing his job...
 Rachel: Oh come on Ross...
 Rachel: (sighs) Oh... Thats true.
 Rachel: Well youre the one who wants to fire him so youre gonna have to do it. (Ross walks to the living room determined to fire Sandy)
 Rachel: I cant watch. Its like firing Elmo. (Ross walks to the couch where Sandy sits)
 Rachel: (from behind the bedroom door) YOU! You feel!
 Rachel: (from bedroom) Oh damn you Geller!
 Rachel: (from the bedroom) Huh ha ha!
 Rachel: Oh yeah she cant be herself.
 Rachel: Yeah totally! You are in such good hands. And Im so good with meeting parents. With the father you know you want to flirt a little bit but not in a gross way. Just kind of like Oh mr. Pincer I can see where Wallis gets his good looks...
 Rachel: Uh he took the SATs for me.
 Rachel: Ssshyeah well duh! I mean...
 Rachel: Oh with the mother just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me moms love me. Rosss mom one time actually said Im like the daughter that she never had.
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mikes parents. Shes so nervous its so sweet!
 Rachel: (in disbelief) You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
 Rachel: Well... well what did you do to make her laugh? (excited)
 Rachel: You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
 Rachel: (disgusted) owwwww...
 Rachel: Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy... (Rachel makes a funny face sticking her tongue out making a farting noise and using her hands as antlers wiggling her fingers... No response from Emma...) Not funny huh? Oh so is it... only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just you know rap in general? Cause mommy can rap... (Rachel tries to rap and makes weird movements with her arms in the process.) My name is mommy and Im here to say / that all the babies are... Oh I cant rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much and I know that youre not gonna tell anybody... (Rachels face is telling Oh what am I doing? The things I have to go through... and she starts to rap) I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers cant deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... (Emma starts to laugh) Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh! (Rachel now really gets into it and her insecure movements start getting better) I like big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers cant deny... Oh Emma youre laughing! Oh you are you really do like big butts dont you. Oh you beautiful little weirdo... (Rachel picks up Emma and Ross now enters)
 Rachel: Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful beautiful sound that...
 Rachel: Oh! You know I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...
 Rachel: Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
 Rachel: So fellas
 Rachel: fellas
 Rachel: has your girlfriend got the butt?
 Rachel: So shake it! (Rachel slaps Rosss butt on the beat)
 Rachel: Shake it! (Phoebe Mike Chandler Monica and Joey step in)
 Rachel: Shake that nasty butt...
 Rachel: One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie you other br... (She also turns and sees the gang)
 Rachel: Who is it?
 Rachel: Hide my rings.
 Rachel: Oh. <opens door preparing herself and then happily says>

 Rachel: Oh sure Ross yeah. If I have a heart attack in a restaurant I want you there with your fossil brush.
 Rachel: What? What happened?
 Rachel: Oh Amy dont cry Amy.  Um.. Ross could I talk to you in private?
 Rachel: Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
 Rachel: Look I know shes a little tough to take. She has no where else to go and shes my sister. Alright shes Emmas aunt. And I would like them to bond.
 Rachel: Ross you know what? She may need one..Were just going to have to make our peace with that!
 Rachel: Hey you guys this is my sister Amy.  This is Chandler Joey Phoebe and you know Mon.
 Rachel: Oh we just put her down for a nap.
 Rachel: Honey I dont know how to tell you this but um if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock on wood> um you wouldnt get the baby.
 Rachel: See look Amy were a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey you dont seem very connected to the baby.
 Rachel: Monica is Ross sister.
 Rachel: Hey. Amy. Youve got to stop doing that.
 Rachel: Well actually...
 Rachel: Honey youre taking this the wrong way. We think youre going to be a wonderful parent. Its just.. youre more the fun parent.
 Rachel: UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amys>
 Rachel: Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didnt give you my baby?
 Rachel: What? What carrer?
 Rachel: Ok. You decorate dads office and so now youre a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now Im a koala bear.
 Rachel: Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didnt even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.
 Rachel: I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why Im not giving Emily to you.
 Rachel: uh huh.
 Rachel: Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You your immaturity? Your total disregard of other peoples feelings?
 Rachel: Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
 Rachel: I cannot I cannot believe that I invited you here today.
 Rachel: ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> Its forty five.
 Rachel: You take that back.
 Rachel: Take it back!
 Rachel: Heey man I work out.
 Rachel: I do pilates.
 Rachel: Bring it on!

 Rachel: Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back>
 Rachel: Ew! Gross.
 Rachel: Mon Im so sorry.
 Rachel: Are you okay Mon?
 Rachel: Look Amy it got a little of control..Um.. and Im sorry. Youre my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..
 Rachel: Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.
 Rachel: She needs changing.
 Rachel: Yeah I cant *wait* to go back to work.
 Rachel: Okay Pheebs you look in the kitchen I will look in the back closet.
 Rachel: We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
 Rachel: Dont worry were just gonna search here for an hour and then were gonna go over to Joeys and search OK?
 Rachel: Chandler arent you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
 Rachel: Chandler thats not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present two medium presents and a bunch of little presents? And youve just gotten her one great present? I mean thats just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
 Rachel: Thats right!
 Rachel: Oh its a Macys bag!
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: (Reading from a tag thats attached to the shoe) Dear losers do you really think Id hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler I knew theyd break you.
 Rachel: Wiper blades. I dont even have a car.
 Rachel: (interrupting him) Oh Chandler stop talking!
 Rachel: (opens her present from Ross; its a dark-red scarf) Oohh I love it!
 Rachel: Well not this second!
 Rachel: Oh wow its so beautiful...
 Rachel: What do you really want to do?
 Rachel: Wha... are you kidding? I cant return this.
 Rachel: Well because if one more person says what a cute little boy Im gonna whip them with a car antenna!
 Rachel: That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl. 
 Rachel: Im just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . (To the guy behind her desk) Who the hell are you!?
 Rachel: Im the hell person whose office this is!
 Rachel: Excuse me?
 Rachel: Wait a minute! What do you mean youre taking over my job?
 Rachel: A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
 Rachel: Alright! Dont get too comfortable there because Im back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I cant say that I care too much for the way youve rearranged my office. 
 Rachel: Excuse me?
 Rachel: Can you please please take care of it for me?
 Rachel: Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
 Rachel: Thats right. Youre very cheeky for a temp. 
 Rachel: Oh yeah what department was that? The Jerk department?
 Rachel: Did they mention that Im rubber and youre glue?
 Rachel: Oh hi Mr. Zelner.
 Rachel: Thats great. So now Super Gavin when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?
 Rachel: (To herself) Oh wow. Super ass-kissing power.
 Rachel: Today.
 Rachel: No I said today! See for a superhero not so much with the listening.
 Rachel: Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didnt come back today they were gonna fire me.
 Rachel: Alright alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didnt actually say that. Im just afraid if I dont come back right now this guys gonna try to squeeze me out. 
 Rachel: I know. You know were just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?
 Rachel: Come on I dont know what else to do.
 Rachel: Ross?

 Rachel: Oh no no no no. I see what youre doing here alright listen this is my job buddy. Okay Ive had it for five years and I know how it works so why dont you just catch me up!
 Rachel: (Sits down in her chair) Oh god. Youve totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?
 Rachel: Fine I will. (Pushes that button thing on the chair that makes it collapse) Alright fill me in! 
 Rachel: Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes but I think Im caught up on everything. So ask me anything!
 Rachel: Except that! (Mr. Zelner enters) Oh hello Mr. Zelner. Were all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
 Rachel: What? I cant do that! I have the baby and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.
 Rachel: Well there you go. You win you win. You get to do the presentation youll knock em dead no one will ever remember that I worked here and then Ralph will buy his helicopter and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!
 Rachel: No I cant I have a baby.
 Rachel: Why would you do that?
 Rachel: Thats really nice.
 Rachel: Then youre not gonna like whats coming. (Starts crying) Im sorry Im sorry Im sorry. Thank you thank you.

 Rachel: Am I the only one who doesnt think that shes hot? Ross?
 Rachel: Thank you! (goes to get coffee)
 Rachel: So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. (Joey and Chandler clap their hands)
 Rachel: Hello.
 Rachel: Gavin I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.
 Rachel: Well when we first met you know I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...
 Rachel: No I just mean that you know first impressions dont mean anything. And I-I think youre a really good guy and Im sorry that I misjudged you.
 Rachel: Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what hey new day new leaf I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) Im sorry obviously Heathers ass has something more important to say so Ill just wait till its finished.
 Rachel: I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
 Rachel: Oh wow you are really youre really a creep.
 Rachel: Oh yeah Im jealous. Oh Gavin please please look at my ass. (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean I just think you are totally inappropriate ok? This is a work environment shes your subordinate.
 Rachel: That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didnt know that you knew that. And two I wasnt some creep staring at his ass we had a deap meaningful relationship.
 Rachel: It was ... (cant remember) oh my god. He didnt have a last name. It was just Tag. You know like Cher or you know Moses.
 Rachel: Oh you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tags last name was Morgan! Huh!
 Rachel: Yeah well what are you his boyfriend?
 Rachel: (to Joey) Hey listen Joey about Molly I really prefer if you didnt go after her.
 Rachel: Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldnt want anything to you know drive her away.
 Rachel: Rachel Greens office!! Give me that phone! (takes the phone) Hello this is Rachel Green how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... Ill pass you back to your son (gives phone to Gavin)
 Rachel: Um excuse me Gavin I have a question I need to ask you.

 Rachel: Well Monica seems to think its because you have feelings for me.
 Rachel: You do?
 Rachel: See? Why Gavin why? Right when Im about to change my opinion of you you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)
 Rachel: Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.

 Rachel: Yeah. It was after the party we were on the balcony and...
 Rachel: You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and oh and he gave me this scarf...
 Rachel: You know honey there is a thin line between love and hate and it turns out that line...is a scarf!
 Rachel: I dont know. Its so complicated. I work with this guy you know I have the baby and I have Ross and I just...I dont

 Rachel: Bye!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: You guys arent doing anything tonight are you?
 Rachel: I was just asking cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
 Rachel: Well Phoebe set me up on a date.

 Rachel: So Ill bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
 Rachel: Oh you guys are gonna have so much fun! Shes at such a cute age. Oh a couple things. Now that shes eating solid food she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair cause she likes to grab it. And oh shes also in this phase where if you leave the room she screams bloody murder but ah... Thanks you guys. Have fun!
 Rachel: Wow everything looks so good! I think Im gonna have the chicken.
 Rachel: Oh well thats - thats very sweet. Thank you.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Well come on Steve; lets not rule out nervous laughter. Hey now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. Thats impressive.
 Rachel: Really? Whats that like?
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Phoebe its me. Im going to hunt you down and kill you!
 Rachel: This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
 Rachel: I dont care! This guy is a nightmare!

 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Oh oh no. Do you think she walked in saw you and left?
 Rachel: Well if it makes you feel any better I wish my date hadnt shown up.
 Rachel: Well he makes t-shirts for a living and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.
 Rachel: Oh. Huh. You know it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didnt even show.
 Rachel: (entering) Joey! You never gonna believe it she called. 
 Rachel: (enthusiastic) You got it!
 Rachel: Your agent called. You got that audition.
 Rachel: Yes.
 Rachel: Yeah and Lennart Haze is starring in it…
 Rachel: (disbelieving) You saw that?
 Rachel: Oh yeah. Oh I loved him in those cell phone commercials. 
 Rachel: Oh anything yet?
 Rachel: Joey that was formula.
 Rachel: Okay first of all thats stupid and second of all Im not allowed to talk to Ralph. 
 Rachel: Hi you guys!
 Rachel: Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
 Rachel: No. I was just going to do this myself. (Joey makes a sarcastic laugh.)
 Rachel: Yeah Why? You dont think a woman can do this?
 Rachel: Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
 Rachel: Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
 Rachel: There is a hardware store right down the street?
 Rachel: This is easy...Cant do this! (Moves away...and finds her sweater sleeve stuck to the drawer) Oh! Wow! Seriously I cant do this. (Fiddles more)
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Yeah I dont know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
 Rachel: Oh thank you so much. (Picks up the guys spirit level) Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game. (hands it to him)
 Rachel: Dont look at me I never get his jokes.
 Rachel: Just when you thought that dude couldnt get any wierder.
 Rachel: I dont know! I mean what brought that on?
 Rachel: No you really think thats what it is?
 Rachel: Yeah! If you dont I will! Of course your bodys gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger your ass is gonna get bigger youre gonna lose bladder control. (she starts sobbing) God! Its just such a magical time!
 Rachel: Argh. fascist
 Rachel: Man dont be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
 Rachel: Oh my god Chandler! If you cant handle this what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present thats shooting out of her!?
 Rachel: Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
 Rachel: Yeah seriously coz this is really heavy. (She suddenly lets go) I mean not for me because im only pretending to hold this but for these guys.
 Rachel: Im so sorry Pheebs.
 Rachel: Hey! How was basketball?
 Rachel: Oh no! Who did that?
 Rachel: She was just crawling around and she found him so I just let her sleep with him. Thats all right? Isnt it?
 Rachel: Joey... are you sure? I mean I know how much you love him!
 Rachel: All right... Oh Emma loves him!
 Rachel: (threatening Joey with a scrunchy) Step away from the crib I have a weapon!
 Rachel: What are you doing?
 Rachel: Oh oh thanks. Alright well now that Im up Im going to go to the bathroom.
 Rachel: Joey Emmas right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
 Rachel: Oh thats so great now Emma has two Hugsys.
 Rachel: Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much I took her everywhere I would braid her tail...
 Rachel: Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I cant find it?
 Rachel: Oh I dont think she likes the new Hugsy.
 Rachel: Yeah I think she wants the old one back.
 Rachel: Joey come on!
 Rachel: Im trying to put Emma down for a nap have you seen Hugsy?
 Rachel: Original.
 Rachel: Then whats that big lump under your covers?
 Rachel: Thats not Monica!
 Rachel: (to herself) Oh God.
 Rachel: (yelling) Joey there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsys ears) Oh dont cover its ears! (stops yelling) Its because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!
 Rachel: Yeah! And shes comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
 Rachel: Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy dont worry. Emma will totally understand. I wont... but whatever (She leaves the room).
 Rachel: Oooh... youre sweet I knew uncle Joey would step up. (Turns to face Emma in the the playpen) Look Emma look whos baaack!
 Rachel: Are you gonna... youre going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
 Rachel: Oh! So youre driving up to Connecticut?
 Rachel: Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why dont we all pitch in 50 bucks well pool our money together and then if we win well split it!
 Rachel: Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
 Rachel: Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what Im saying.
 Rachel: Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!
 Rachel: She dropped off a casserole?
 Rachel: (to Monica)Whats going on?
 Rachel: Well theres two spots left right?
 Rachel: Oh no Im good I dont wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.
 Rachel: You know Ross just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
 Rachel: Oh I know I know the odds are against us but somebody has to win and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know were gonna be all like oh everybody lets take our helicopters up to the cape and youre gonna be all like oh I cant guys Ill meet you guys up there I gotta gas up the Hyundai
 Rachel: I dont really care about the Knicks.
 Rachel: (touched) You would do that? I never get picked!
 Rachel: Im hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
 Rachel: Ooh you guys it starts in like 20 minutes.
 Rachel: Ooh I have another idea!
 Rachel: Well well well look what mommy found!!
 Rachel: Ok well Monica suppose one of your special tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
 Rachel: Chandler would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
 Rachel: All right believe me.If you win the lottery its the last youre gonna hear from us!
 Rachel: (surprised) OH! Alright you know what? Thats it! I want my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!
 Rachel: Ok thats it! Just giveem to me! Ill split them up! (she tries to snatch the bowl from Joeys hands but she cant so she pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)
 Rachel: Oh if she jumps I get her tickets.
 Rachel: Oh it is so unfair. Its like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.
 Rachel: No she was just much better at job than me!
 Rachel: (To Ross) You know what? We should call my mums house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
 Rachel: Hi mum put her back on!
 Rachel: (on the phone) Mum please!I know you love your new lips but I can barely understand you! Would you please just let me say goodnight to my daughter?
 Rachel: (she goes towards the others and shes very excited) Guys youre not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!
 Rachel: She said gleba!! (she celebrates)

 Rachel: Why-why arent you more excited?
 Rachel: Oh but of course it is!
 Rachel: I dont know all the words.
 Rachel: Ok... Emma just said gleba!
 Rachel: Okay okay okay fine Im gonna look it up (she goes and picks up the dictionary).
 Rachel: (searching the dictionary) Alright okay okay gleba gleba... (excited) Gleba! Ha! Here it is the fleshy spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.
 Rachel: You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: So Pheebs what are you going to do with your $3?
 Rachel: Me too.
 Rachel: I dont wanna stand in the way of true love or anything but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less.
 Rachel: Woow!I havent seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
 Rachel: (excited) Are you serious?
 Rachel: Hey that was an honest mistake!
 Rachel: Yeah that was an awesome day!

 Rachel: Ok well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.
 Rachel: Oh yeah! I mean that was pretty intense.
 Rachel: I dont know! I mean maybe thats something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.
 Rachel: Olivia.
 Rachel: So do you think that my dream means anything?
 Rachel: Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drakes lines in the dream...
 Rachel: You took the same class twice.

 Rachel: (shakes her head) Alright alright look just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love and think about that when youre playing the scene.

 Rachel: No reason.
 Rachel: Yeah

 Rachel: (giggling and whispering) Maybe.
 Rachel: (whispering) Why? (Monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with because) Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.

 Rachel: For like a half an hour! Man you can lie about Sweden!
 Rachel: How could you not tell me you worked here?
 Rachel: Yes you do if youre going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!

 Rachel: What? Ross and Charlie? (Joey nods) Wow! Shes really making her way through the group huh? Ah who am I to talk?
 Rachel: Oh ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows were just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. (Joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) Thats not nonchalant!
 Rachel: Oh... okay just hide!
 Rachel: Coming! Try under the bed try under the bed!
 Rachel: Theres no room under the bed. (looks around because she cant find Joey anymore)
 Rachel: Yeah... (still looking to see where Joey went and opens the door)
 Rachel: Hi...
 Rachel: ...I really dont... (looks around again)
 Rachel: Yeah sure... (looks outside into the corridor if Joey is there)
 Rachel: (clearly not listening and still trying to find out where Joey went) Uh-huh... right... yeah...
 Rachel: (still searching) Oh I know... I know its been really hard for you.
 Rachel: (now looking up at the ceiling) That is hard to say Ross. That is hard to say.
 Rachel: You would think!
 Rachel: Joey!
 Rachel: (still cant find him) How are you doing this?
 Rachel: How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
 Rachel: Ah what is this? Well lets see we kissed for ten minutes and now were talking to our friends about it so I guess this is sixth grade!
 Rachel: All right look you guys... Look we appreciate all the advice but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...
 Rachel: Sure...
 Rachel: Get out!
 Rachel: Are they right?
 Rachel: Yeah... Yeah we can wait we dont have to do anything tonight.
 Rachel: (Joey walks to the door) Although...
 Rachel: I mean you know... Ross and I havent dated in like... six years...
 Rachel: Plus you know he is with Charlie now.
 Rachel: No...
 Rachel: Yeah...
 Rachel: Forgotten.
 Rachel: Nothing...
 Rachel: Nothing... Its really... Its nothing... Come here come here...
 Rachel: Sorry I just uhm... I cant seem to get Ross out of my head...
 Rachel: Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
 Rachel: Okay well keep in mind that by the time youre done theyll probably be serving dinner.
 Rachel: Still nervous?
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Yeah yeah sure! Yeah! (mouths Good luck to Joey and gets up from her seat)
 Rachel: So hi!
 Rachel: So you eh you talked to Joey?
 Rachel: Oh! Thats great!
 Rachel: Oh so everythings okay?
 Rachel: Ah... Well obviously I think so too.
 Rachel: Really? Excited?
 Rachel: Excuse me! (and she walks back to Joey who is still looking very impressed about what Ross said to him. Rachel looks at him and hits him.) You didnt tell him did you?
 Rachel: Oh God! Alright fine. You know what Joey forget it. When we go back to New York I will tell him.
 Rachel: That was one time Ross and they were only like 5 milligrams.
 Rachel: Aaah... Ross actually theres something that I really need to talk to you about.
 Rachel: Okay uhm... alright heres the deal.
 Rachel: What? What is it?
 Rachel: Uh look Ross this really isnt easy.
 Rachel: Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
 Rachel: Well yeah... Okay look its about me and...
 Rachel: Wow! Well clearly this is not a good time.

 Rachel: Goo--ood night!
 Rachel: Seriously good night!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: We werent doing anything!
 Rachel: Shhh.
 Rachel: No come on that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
 Rachel: Yeah you started it! Ive got to chill.
 Rachel: We feel so terrible about this Ross.
 Rachel: Ross? (to Joey) Can we just close the door?
 Rachel: Ross say something. Anything.
 Rachel: No no no!
 Rachel: Ross this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
 Rachel: No but you know what I mean.
 Rachel: Calm ourselves?
 Rachel: Well what would we be doing?
 Rachel: Feel me up?
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Oh you bet.
 Rachel: Okay well we brought you some wine.
 Rachel: Well maybe the next batch we could all get some.
 Rachel: No awareness.
 Rachel: Look Charlie I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know he normally doesnt drink like this.
 Rachel: Ross you dont even have oven mitts on!
 Rachel: Ooy.
 Rachel: Oh my god are we supposed to answer?
 Rachel: Ross you dont seem okay.
 Rachel: Oh thats okay girls tend not to like me.
 Rachel: You know what Ross? I think were gonna take off too.
 Rachel: No no its just that its getting late...
 Rachel: Yeah thats probably a good idea.
 Rachel: Uh-huh. Okay. You know what Joey I dont think hes ever gonna be okay with this.
 Rachel: Thanks for dinner.
 Rachel: So.
 Rachel: I say ‘cheesy line’ but ok.
 Rachel: I am sorry I don’t know I am sorry I don’t know why I did that!
 Rachel: Ok so sorry.
 Rachel: I am sorry! Again... I dont know I don’t know what happened I must be nervous!
 Rachel: Ok ok ok. I promise I promise I promise I won’t do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.
 Rachel: Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a little weird it’s you and it’s me its just gonna take some getting used to.
 Rachel: Ok let’s work from the top down! (Joey nods but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra Joe!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Ow!
 Rachel: Well this is romantic!
 Rachel: It’s a standard issue bra clasp!
 Rachel: Ok well well Im really Im sorry about that Joey but do you think that maybe on some level you dont want to take off my bra?
 Rachel: (laughing) oooh! Oh oh!
 Rachel: oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
 Rachel: Well it was good.. until we got back to our apartment and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!
 Rachel: Well it wasnt just me alright? He freaked out too! He couldnt even undo my bra!
 Rachel: I do not know whats wrong with us I mean we have kissed before and thats been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
 Rachel: (looking thoughtful) Ok thats true. Thats true we can do this. Youre right youre right we can do this. Were just gonna power through!
 Rachel: (To Joey) No need!! Problem solved we are powering through (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment).
 Rachel: Hey! Got champagne?
 Rachel: Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket the phone is off the hook and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove her bra from under her clothes)...
 Rachel: Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy sexy very sexy sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey clearly very excited) Alright! Lets do it!
 Rachel: Oh! Get over it soldier weve gotta do this! (She pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like that huh?
 Rachel: You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively putting her knees next to Joeys hips.) Lets take this into high gear (She pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)
 Rachel: Yeah baby Ill show you how we do it!
 Rachel: What? Oh my God! Im so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
 Rachel: What is the matter with us?
 Rachel: No I mean with us you know. I mean is it supposed to be this... difficult?
 Rachel: Hi! Hey listen can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
 Rachel: No no no... No I mean... se-x-u-ally...
 Rachel: Well just because it happened that way for them doesnt mean it has to happen that way for us.
 Rachel: Right totally.
 Rachel: Yeah and if doesnt work then well be just one of those couples that never have sex.
 Rachel: I know.
 Rachel: Hmmm... Me too...
 Rachel: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
 Rachel: Aah... I bet youre right.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Love you too... Alright Im going to bed.
 Rachel: Wait you cant go away this weekend! Its Emmas birthday!
 Rachel: Were having a party.
 Rachel: No that day... that wont be her real birthday!
 Rachel: Well cant you just go to Vermont the next day?
 Rachel: And I mean you know you guys... This is a big deal. I mean how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
 Rachel: You know Pheebs when I was little on my birthday my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find em all.
 Rachel: Oh good good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and well give it to her when she is 18.
 Rachel: Oh no its still nap time. But shell be up soon.
 Rachel: I said its still nap time.
 Rachel: Hey Joey will you please set this up for people to put Emmas presents on?
 Rachel: Oh shes still napping
 Rachel: Look I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isnt a really big deal to you but it really is to us ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.
 Rachel: No really she didnt sleep well last night so we cant wake her up.
 Rachel: Oh! Emma might like what?
 Rachel: What did you get her?
 Rachel: Well this sounds like fun! Well you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap so would you mind performing them once now?
 Rachel: (to everybody) All right let’s get this party started huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
 Rachel: So Joey what are you gonna do for us?
 Rachel: Oh ok which one?
 Rachel: (crying) Wow! That was amazing!
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
 Rachel: Is that it?
 Rachel: Ross um don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s in a box in the fridge.
 Rachel: Oh youre gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey Corino’s.
 Rachel: Well anyway they make these great novelty cakes in all different shapes and if you give them a photo they’ll copy it in icing!
 Rachel: Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
 Rachel: Ross what are you talking about? (she sees the cake) oh! Oh my God! They put my baby’s face on a penis!
 Rachel: Why you guys this isnt funny all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
 Rachel: Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back I dont even want it in my home... (Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a piece and yells at him) Joey dont touch it!!
 Rachel: (speaking to the person on the phone again) Yes yes. I still want my daughters picture but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake chocolate frosting with nuts!
 Rachel: (into the phone) No there isnt time to go to the bakery. Were just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright well just tell Emma were gonna be there as soon as we can. (emotionally) Bye...
 Rachel: OOH! God! Sorry!
 Rachel: Emmas awake.
 Rachel: I cant believe this. This is her first birthday. Shes awake. Were not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
 Rachel: Oh why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
 Rachel: (shakes her head) I guess... Oh I just had such an idea of what this day would be like you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing Happy Birthday. Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! (honks furiously and Ross looks at her in disbelief and Rachel looks at him.) They have to learn!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: (she looks at the cake) Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
 Rachel: Well Im very impressed.
 Rachel: I dont care that you left. Im just glad that youre here. Thanks you guys!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh! Emma thats right! Youre that many!
 Rachel: (angrily) NO no science camp!
 Rachel: Oh!... Oh and Emma look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
 Rachel: Oh yeah nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Okay. (they both look into the camera and Ross waves.) Hi Emma. Well your first birthday is over and it was really...
 Rachel: You know Im thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.
 Rachel: Ive never given her a cookie. Have you?
 Rachel: Of course Id be honored!
 Rachel: OH! Whats it the anniversary of? Your first date your first kiss first time you had sex...
 Rachel: Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! (they hug) Wow! You remember Joey?
 Rachel: So now what are you doing here?
 Rachel: (Emma starts crying in the other room) Oh sorry hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
 Rachel: God!
 Rachel: Oh I know isnt she?
 Rachel: All right. Whats your news Amy?
 Rachel: What? Oh my God! To who?
 Rachel: A-And??
 Rachel: No whats he like?
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Huh... wow so hes gotta be...
 Rachel: Sweety I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
 Rachel: Oh... sit down sit down. Oh honey you know I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?
 Rachel: Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm so but anyway listen not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever ever made. Honey you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there somewhere. Someone that is your age that is smart that is fun and that you care about!
 Rachel: Ok.
 Rachel: Ok let’s keep talking.
 Rachel: Amy hi!
 Rachel: Oh good for you!
 Rachel: Yes you are! Oh I am so proud of you!
 Rachel: But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
 Rachel: Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron get off!’
 Rachel: Joey I can’t do that!
 Rachel: Well Joey uhm look I know that she’s difficult but I think it’s really good that she’s here.
 Rachel: No its just... look you know when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
 Rachel: Well uhm... whatever I have really appreciated it cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience but that’s ok.
 Rachel: Amy that’s what I was supposed to wear today that’s why I hung it on the door.
 Rachel: Amy you know what? I was thinking that maybe now itd be a good time for us to sit down and you know talk about your future.
 Rachel: Well what happened?
 Rachel: Oh that is so tacky.
 Rachel: Phoebe that’s huge!
 Rachel: I think it could be kind of great!
 Rachel: (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands together faking excitement)
 Rachel: (Takes the phone) Oh! Thats interesting since she died seven years ago!!
 Rachel: (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh its our nanny! (goes back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok bye! (Hangs up) (To Ross) Thats Molly shes sick. Can you watch Emma today?
 Rachel: Menstrual cramps.
 Rachel: (To Monica Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma?
 Rachel: (To Ross) Great shoot what are we gonna do?
 Rachel: (Thinks for a moment) Well actually...
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Why not?
 Rachel: (Defends Amy) Wha.. well Ellas a nice name!
 Rachel: (Shocked) Wha... the next one?
 Rachel: Ross I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
 Rachel: Ross Im telling you shes giving up getting her eyebrows (points at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?
 Rachel: Absolutely.
 Rachel: (To Emma) Hey! Hi hows my girl?
 Rachel: (sounds excited) Yeah!
 Rachel: (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!?
 Rachel: You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?
 Rachel: Oh my God Oh my God here comes Ross. Hes gonna flip out.
 Rachel: Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emmas head and half her face with it)
 Rachel: Nah I dont really want her to see.
 Rachel: Nothing.
 Rachel: Oh theyre real!
 Rachel: I know I know and you were right Ross. (To Amy) You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
 Rachel: I cant believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
 Rachel: Oh yeah? Since when?
 Rachel: (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What?
 Rachel: (shouting) Babies dont care if theyre slim.
 Rachel: Joey get Amys bags she is moving out!
 Rachel: You put holes in my babys ears!
 Rachel: (gasps) I cant believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
 Rachel: Excuse me?
 Rachel: (yelling) Joey where are those bags?
 Rachel: (doesnt believe what shes hearing) Seriously?
 Rachel: Hips or thighs?
 Rachel: (gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
 Rachel: (embarrassed) Oh I can give you that.
 Rachel: Yeah. I just I kept trying to make you a better person but youre... youre already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
 Rachel: Did you just say Emma?
 Rachel: So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
 Rachel: Thats shocking!
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: My God!
 Rachel: Congratulations! Wow!!
 Rachel: Mmh-mmh!
 Rachel: Oh Pheebs baby thats nice but you know what I think Im ok. Why dont you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?
 Rachel: (angrily) GIVE ME THE BOOK! (she takes it and start reading) Pablo Diaz Brady Smith huh Guy-in-van?
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Phoebe isnt Jethro Tull a band?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Im sorry this sounds like something Im never gonna be interested in.
 Rachel: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it but your bosses didnt. Then that way youre the good guy and theyre the bad guys.
 Rachel: Whos Gladys?
 Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
 Rachel: Well I mean sure of course. But... you already gave that to Monica so...
 Rachel: No I couldnt let you do that.
 Rachel: But I dont want you to.
 Rachel: But I insist harder!
 Rachel: (sarcastic) No no thats ok. You won fair and square. Im so sad!
 Rachel: Did you watch the tape?
 Rachel: But you are a liar.
 Rachel: Well this is going well. (Chandler looks worried)
 Rachel: (surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh shes so nice and big! Oh Monica where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly? (looks around for a spot)
 Rachel: Well hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to the spot where her famous French poster is hanging). That way it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
 Rachel: (jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! Theres nothing above your bed!!
 Rachel: O-oh my God!
 Rachel: Joey what... is... this...thing... doing here?
 Rachel: Joey were not keeping this!
 Rachel: Alright fine. You can keep it. As long as you dont mind that shes haunted.
 Rachel: Well legend has it Joey that... she comes alive when youre asleep.
 Rachel: She climbs out of the frame and then drags her half-a-body across the floor just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky slow voice) And then with her one good hand she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
 Rachel: Well why I told him its haunted. Two can play at this game. (gives Gladys to Monica)
 Rachel: Yes I can! (pushes her back again)
 Rachel: Shes yours!
 Rachel: Shes yours!
 Rachel: Shes mine!
 Rachel: Shes mine!
 Rachel: I want Gladys!
 Rachel: Shes mine!
 Rachel: Shes mine!
 Rachel: Excellent!
 Rachel: Ha ha ha third time this week. Man this does not get old.
 Rachel: Oh dont be such a baby!
 Rachel: Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
 Rachel: Oh hey Ross... Listen I heard about you and Charlie. Im really sorry.
 Rachel: Absolutely.
 Rachel: So uhm... what are you gonna do today?
 Rachel: Oh my God what!?
 Rachel: Ok look Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
 Rachel: (upset) All right well if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
 Rachel: Yes I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! (crying) And it was uneven for weeks!
 Rachel: Ok fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
 Rachel: Ross those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When youre... and there is that moment when you are at the top when you just dont know if youre gonna return back to earth!
 Rachel: All right!
 Rachel: Irrational huh? All right well I’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
 Rachel: Ok careful.
 Rachel: Careful watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
 Rachel: I know (she touches Emma’s head) but they’re just so beautiful! Oh my God I just pulled one out.
 Rachel: Ok.
 Rachel: Ok.
 Rachel: Ok careful ok. (Emma giggles) Oh she’s smiling! Oh my God she does like it!
 Rachel: Awe! (Emma laughs) Oh my God! Looks she’s a little dare-devil! Oh let me push can I push?
 Rachel: Ok. Oh God. (To Ross) Get the camera it’s in the diaper bag.
 Rachel: Oh oh Ross oh my God are you okay?
 Rachel: Ross see! I told you those swings are evil! Alright that is it. That is 
 Rachel: Ross cmon please. Can we just get out of here before somebody else gets 
 Rachel: (looks at him suspiciously) I know what this is all about... Youve always been 
 Rachel: Alright fine. Ill do it.
 Rachel: If you hold a spider.
 Rachel: IF you hold a spider.
 Rachel: Ok... I got a spider. There were two I picked the bigger one.
 Rachel: Ok... (and passes the spider to Ross who holds it in between his hands)
 Rachel: (reluctantly) Ok... O-k...
 Rachel: (more confident) Ok...
 Rachel: whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
 Rachel: A-alright! I can do this.
 Rachel: Thats because hes on your neck.
 Rachel: ROSS!
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: I cant believe this! This is Emmas first Thanksgiving!
 Rachel: Its not? (whispering to Ross) When was she born?
 Rachel: Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
 Rachel: Did you at least win the contest?
 Rachel: Cant wait!
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Well lets see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
 Rachel: Oh my God! Thats the creepiest thing Ive ever heard!
 Rachel: Oh! Phoebe all babies are beautiful!
 Rachel: Phoebe just the idea of pitting one baby against another I mean you know and judging whos cuter just for a trophy...
 Rachel: And a thousand dollars.
 Rachel: ...is something Im very interested in! Oh please do not tell Ross. He still believes that (in a deep voice mocking Ross) whats in the inside is important...
 Rachel: Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
 Rachel: Oh take the clothes of Joeys Cabbage Patch Kid.
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe listen. Well I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. Ive been watching this guy over there I dont think he came with a kid!
 Rachel: Phoebe I think... Its just too weird I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe! Come on! You know what its already three oclock and they havent even gotten to Emmas group yet. We gotta go we got dinner!
 Rachel: Phoebe you have to calm down.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: You heard them say that?
 Rachel: All right okay. Alright lets give to these babies something to cry about!
 Rachel: No what?
 Rachel: No Phoebe I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
 Rachel: Because I already did!
 Rachel: No...
 Rachel: What are you doing here!
 Rachel: And I won!
 Rachel: Yes! (spells it) Y-E-S. Yes!
 Rachel: Yeah. Thats me!
 Rachel: She won a thousand dollars!
 Rachel: Well I dont know you guys figure it out I got to put Emma down for a nap.
 Rachel: Alright Emma is napping... (then to Ross) what happened to your shirt?
 Rachel: You know what we just say that she said it was 5 oclock. Well just act casual. Were not late were right on time. (When she finishes talking a note is pushed from under Monicas and Chandlers door into the hall. Ross picks it up and reads it out loud)
 Rachel: Oh God. This is bad. This is so bad.
 Rachel: Oh hey I have an idea. Why dont we play rock-paper-scissors and whoever loses goes in first. (they all agree) Ready? (they do the rock-paper-scissor thing with they hands and Rachel has paper Phoebe and Ross both have rock while Joey is doing a strange upward wiggling with his fingers. They all look a him confused).
 Rachel: Alright enough enough come on. Lets just all go in at the same time.
 Rachel: Alright come on... (starts to knock on the door) Alright you guys. Were so sorry were late. Please let us in so we can have dinner together.
 Rachel: You guys come on it doesnt matter why were late. Were all here now please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. (A slice of turkey on a piece of aluminum foil is slid under door)
 Rachel: (gasps) Oh I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
 Rachel: Huh... OH MY GOD ITS BRUSSELS SPROUTS. (they all look appalled)
 Rachel: Oh I know... I still have my old key! (She goes in to get it and comes back with her keys) We can just unlock the door.
 Rachel: You know what? I dont want to be with them either but its Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together together. (Goes to unlock the door)
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: So bad.
 Rachel: Dessert?
 Rachel: Congratulatioooons!
 Rachel: Ewww is that what that is?
 Rachel: Yeah! Ill cook!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: I lent them to Ross.
 Rachel: Im so happy for you!
 Rachel: To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: (to Joey) Hey whos Phoebe with?
 Rachel: Do you think Im someone else?
 Rachel: Well believe it or not its true. When Joey and I were together he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out he didnt sleep with anybody else!
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Well its a little low... pick up a little... (Ross picks it up) a little bit more... (he picks it up again) a little bit more... (he takes it off) There you go! (pause) Now throw it away!
 Rachel: Ross please trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now I dont know whos running for president or who that... NATO guy is but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
 Rachel: Hi
 Rachel: what?
 Rachel: Oh! Oh no!
 Rachel: Oh yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
 Rachel: Oh no! Not me! Emma!
 Rachel: Ah this place is great!
 Rachel: Ross look I know that some of this stuff is out there but I mean come on look at this look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). I mean this is just beautiful!
 Rachel: Yeah down from seven hundred you are saving like two hundred bucks!
 Rachel: No no no no! Ross wait! Come on! You know there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt look at these nice pants...
 Rachel: Yes they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
 Rachel: Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please just wear what I suggest and she’s gonna go nuts for you.
 Rachel: (to Phoebe) Why do men keep talking to me like this?
 Rachel: We got some really great stuff!
 Rachel: Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
 Rachel: (looking into one of her shopping bags) Oh no! I took one of Ross bags by 
 Rachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you werent there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are you are!
 Rachel: Hi sure!
 Rachel: Oh God... well it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet n Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out and thats when it hit me how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Yknow I mean I always knew looked familiar but... Anyway I just had to get out of there and I started wondering Why am I doing this and who am I doing this for?. (to Monica) So anyway I just didnt know where to go and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart but youre the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
 Rachel: Ooh I was kinda hoping that wouldnt be an issue... [Scene Monicas Apartment everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV and are trying to figure out what is going on.]
 Rachel: (on phone) Daddy I just... I cant marry him! Im sorry. I just dont love him. Well it matters to me!
 Rachel: Cmon Daddy listen to me! Its like its like all of my life everyone has always told me Youre a shoe! Youre a shoe youre a shoe youre a shoe!. And today I just stopped and I said What if I dont wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse yknow? Or a- or a hat! No Im not saying I want you to buy me a hat Im saying I am a ha- Its a metaphor Daddy!
 Rachel: Look Daddy its my life. Well maybe Ill just stay here with Monica.
 Rachel: Well maybe thats my decision. Well maybe I dont need your money. Wait!! Wait I said maybe!!
 Rachel: Im all better now.
 Rachel: Please no go thatd be fine!
 Rachel: Well I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon so nothing!
 Rachel: Well actually thanks but I think Im just gonna hang out here tonight.  Its been kinda a long day.
 Rachel: Barry Im sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on but it isnt... it isnt its about me and I ju- (She stops talking and dials the phone.) Hi machine cut me off again... anyway...look look I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel but it isnt me its not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now but you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)
 Rachel: Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! Thats the difference!
 Rachel: Isnt this amazing? I mean I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
 Rachel: Yknow I figure if I can make coffee there isnt anything I cant do.
 Rachel: Hello Paul.
 Rachel: So like you guys all have jobs?
 Rachel: Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
 Rachel: I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
 Rachel: Oh yeah.
 Rachel: Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
 Rachel: Want a wedding dress?   Hardly used.
 Rachel: Oh look wish me luck!
 Rachel: Im gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job things.
 Rachel: Guess what?
 Rachel: Are you kidding? Im trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
 Rachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale fifty percent off!
 Rachel: Theyre my new I dont need a job I dont need my parents Ive got great boots boots!
 Rachel: Uh credit card.
 Rachel: Um... my... father.
 Rachel: Oh God come on you guys is this really necessary?  I mean I can stop charging anytime I want.
 Rachel: I know that. Thats why I was getting married.
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: No.  No no Im not ready!  How can I be ready?  Hey Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?  Come on I cant do this!
 Rachel: I dont think so.
 Rachel: Yknow what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  Its kinda like a symbolic gesture...
 Rachel: Hey Mon look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What?
 Rachel: Sorry-
 Rachel: No you have it really I dont want it-
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: I knew.
 Rachel: I did.
 Rachel: Yeah maybe...
 Rachel: Goodnight.
 Rachel: (walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee?
 Rachel: Im just serving it.
 Rachel: Ugh. (To another customer thats leaving.) Excuse me could you give this to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank you. (To the gang.) Sorry.  Okay Las Vegas.

 Rachel: Oh look at her so happy!
 Rachel: Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
 Rachel: Whos Nancy?
 Rachel: Are you serious?
 Rachel: What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? Im doing it Ross is doing it Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
 Rachel: Yeah it is.
 Rachel: Well it is all right? When we were out there today all I kept thinking was I cant believe Chandler is screwing this woman but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
 Rachel: (talking on the phone) Cmon Daddy listen to me! All of my life everyone has always told me Youre a shoe! Youre a shoe youre a shoe youre a shoe!. And today I just stopped and I said What if I dont wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse yknow? Or a- or a hat!

 Rachel: Well maybe Ill just stay here with Monica.

 Rachel: That is not true. She did! She forced me!
 Rachel: Well it stupid unfair question!
 Rachel: (running from the guys apartment with Joey in tow) Hey whats-whats going on?!
 Rachel: Funny because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
 Rachel: Well Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
 Rachel: Yeah I do. I-I do do that.
 Rachel: Well y’know I don’t want you to be cold.
 Rachel: And a crappy New Year.
 Rachel: You cant move. You just... you just cant.
 Rachel: Yeah. So dont move okay? Just stay here and... (nods towards Ross) maybe close your blinds at night.
 Rachel: Yeah were gonna let you be alone.
 Rachel: Aah! Why? What are these for?
 Rachel: Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful. (she got a scarf)
 Rachel: Oh God thats right. I blocked that out.
 Rachel: Oh dyou like it?
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Pheebs I... there isnt gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
 Rachel: Seriously Pheebs its not gonna be that kind of a party.
 Rachel: Nooo! Phoebe of course there is more! I mean Ill just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pees!
 Rachel: Well hes coming from Jersey he said he would get here as fast as he could!
 Rachel: (pretends to be shocked) Uh! The police!
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: All right look we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
 Rachel: No thats ok lets me just get my check book!
 Rachel: This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
 Rachel: I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight Im sooo gonna let them! (They spot Chandler)
 Rachel: It... You can so totally tell.
 Rachel: Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. (They walk towards Chandler) Hey hows it going (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails).
 Rachel: Yeah Rachel. And this (points to Monica) is Ross sister Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do).
 Rachel: Bitchin
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: I am sooo drunk.
 Rachel: (finishing the last of her drink) I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
 Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why dont I just start taking my smart pills now?
 Rachel: (blushing) Oh what a line. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards Chandler and whispers Oh my God!)
 Rachel: Oh well You know I think its kinda really important that I go somewhere where theres sun so Im sort of... (Chandler leans in an kisses her) (She pulls away) Hey!
 Rachel: (She considers it for a second) Yeah okay. (She puts her hands around his neck and they start kissing again)
 Rachel: No wait. No theres gotta be something else that you can do. I mean what skills do you have?
 Rachel: So maybe something in an office.
 Rachel: (to Phoebe) Really?
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Oh Monica made me send her to my mothers. Apparently babies and weddings dont mix.
 Rachel: Uh... November?
 Rachel: Hey Pheebs...
 Rachel: Uhm... you havent told these guys what theyre doing in the wedding yet.
 Rachel: Well this is really awkward (staring at the floor) Oh and I can leave!
 Rachel: (excited and clapping her hands in front of her face) Goody what is it!
 Rachel: What what what no I dont wanna do that.
 Rachel: Happy wedding day!
 Rachel: Ok-dokey Joey listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central all right? Were gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
 Rachel: What dyou want?
 Rachel: Oh Ross cmon please! Dont make this harder than it already is!
 Rachel: Well Chandler said that its really important to him too!
 Rachel: Oh you are the lesser of two evils!
 Rachel: Hi
 Rachel: Even so I think Im gonna pick Ross.
 Rachel: All right fine I pick you.
 Rachel: (not amused by his pun but forcing a smile anyway) Oh my...
 Rachel: Well in my defense you were not supposed to tell each other.
 Rachel: Whos there?
 Rachel: Uh.
 Rachel: You know what I cant do this. I dont know which one of you guys to pick.
 Rachel: (sarcastic) Wow this is a tough one. I think Im gonna have to go with the dog.
 Rachel: Since when do you watch the news?
 Rachel: Wow you know its so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why dont you guys just do it on the street?
 Rachel: Well look its hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldnt ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding youve always wanted!
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe Im so happy for you honey. (she gives her a kiss)
 Rachel: Geez Ross you could have showered.
 Rachel: How was the honeymoon?
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: I did not know you spoke French.
 Rachel: Oh... youre so sexy!
 Rachel: Seriously stop it or Im gonna jump on ya.
 Rachel: Ross...
 Rachel: My father had an heart attack... (crying) ...while I was at Barney’s.
 Rachel: Yeah they said hes gonna be fine but hes still heavily sedated.
 Rachel: No come on Im totally ok. (hugging him) I dont need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
 Rachel: Ok. If you really need to.
 Rachel: Oh I really could.
 Rachel: Ohh... (Ross mouths HA-HA at Monica and takes two cookies and she looks at him angrily)
 Rachel: (stopping a nurse whos coming out of a room) Oh uhm excuse me Im here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
 Rachel: Ross please this is a hospital ok? That actually means something here.
 Rachel: Can somebody please go in?
 Rachel: Ross please dont be so scared of him!
 Rachel: Oh! (They enter. Rachel sees his father lying on a bed with tubes drip and everything) Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh ohhh wow that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain huh?
 Rachel: Oh great Are you gonna be ok?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Uh. (pause) Did you call your parents?
 Rachel: Oh good.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: What do you mean? Youve been in my room before!
 Rachel: Ok I gotta tell ya its really weird when you use my whole name.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Yeah just so weird seeing him like that you know? I mean he is a doctor you dont expect doctors to get sick!
 Rachel: (shes sad) Ow. I dont want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Really I shouldnt feel guilty?
 Rachel: Ok maybe youre right.
 Rachel: Wait wait wait wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
 Rachel: Ok. (She sits on the bed and Ross sits near her) Thank you for coming with me today.
 Rachel: Rachel Green is very happy youre in her room!
 Rachel: I just dont want to be alone tonight.
 Rachel: Wait we wont know that until we do it will we?
 Rachel: Taking advantage? Im giving you the advantage enjoy!
 Rachel: Wow. Ok.
 Rachel: Mhm-mh!
 Rachel: (She turns around very slowly looks at him for a second and then turns back to her coffee) Sure. (She gives him the cup she was pouring for herself without looking at him)
 Rachel: Hmm-hmm. (starts to pour herself a cup of coffee never looking at Ross)
 Rachel: (coldly) Yep.
 Rachel: FYI..
 Rachel: In the future when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it. (she smiles fakely at him)
 Rachel: (sarcastically) Really? Well it seems to me if youd done the right thing I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
 Rachel: Oh stop that!
 Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
 Rachel: Oh really well Ross you know what? I am a big girl. I dont need someone telling me what is best for me.
 Rachel: Oh really really? Well it wasnt very good for me either. (She turns to leave and Ross over takes her and stands infront on her his back to the row of doors leading to the hospital rooms)
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh good.
 Rachel: Okay... Hey listen just before you go I-I again I just wanna say thank you for coming with me.
 Rachel: And also you know I uh I was thinking about what you said you know about the whole sex thing and... its probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
 Rachel: Its a shame though I mean when we did it it was pretty good.
 Rachel: Hey uhm do you remember that one really great time...?
 Rachel: You know it was youre uhm... birthday...
 Rachel: Well I guess thats all in the past now.
 Rachel: (after a pause) Not even one more time?
 Rachel: No matter how much we want it.
 Rachel: Thats what we decided.
 Rachel: ...Its kinda hard though!
 Rachel: You know when two people have a connection you know thats... just seems like such a... waste.
 Rachel: ...Ross?
 Rachel: Just so you know... With us... its never off the table. (she enters her room and closes the door.)
 Rachel: (while entering) Hi you guys.
 Rachel: Ooh Italian! (she also grabs a plate)
 Rachel: Hey you guys... Youre never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
 Rachel: Congratulations!
 Rachel: Ooh! (they hug)
 Rachel: (to maitre d) Hi Im here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. Its spelled like Gukki which could be confusing.
 Rachel: Oh my God! Thats my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
 Rachel: But my... but my boss cannot see me. Im interviewing for another job.
 Rachel: Sssshhhh!

 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Yes hi!
 Rachel: Hi! (to mr Zellner) Excuse us.
 Rachel: Okay. Oh yeah... (whispering to mr Zellner) Oh hes cute!
 Rachel: Wha... My resumé? I wouldnt... I wouldnt call my online dating profile a resumé.
 Rachel: (starts singing la la la la) Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
 Rachel: What? I-I dont.
 Rachel: No I-I-I love it there.
 Rachel: Oh! Its not good.
 Rachel: Well I didnt get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
 Rachel: Well my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that hes gonna have to let me go because Im not a team player. And I said Wait a minute! Yes I am. and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
 Rachel: Oh it... good! Yeah but Im not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
 Rachel: Ah all right. Heres to Ross!
 Rachel: (crying) No its not that. I got fired today. And I didnt get the other job.
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: No its okay you didnt know.
 Rachel: Oh thank you... (looks at his face trying to remember his name)
 Rachel: (Is embarrassed for a moment but it quickly passes) Well now I dont have to. (The man leaves instantly)
 Rachel: (annoyed) Ross what is taking you so long?
 Rachel: (turns around) Mark? Oh my God! (puts the box on the chair and they hug each other)
 Rachel: Im fantastic. You remember Ross?
 Rachel: Oh well (looks at her box and chair) youre not catching me on my best day.
 Rachel: No but its good you know Im gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
 Rachel: Well screw charity work. Whatve you got?
 Rachel: Great! Ill call ya!
 Rachel: (very excited) Oh my God!
 Rachel: Ross! Thats Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
 Rachel: Yes.
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: What? You dont want me to get a job?
 Rachel: Ugh.
 Rachel: Ross you know what? (looks over to the door and sees security staring at them) Okay lets talk about it later there comes security. (Takes her box and leaves. Ross follows her and then returns for the chair. He stands for a moment then pushes it quickly in the general direction Rachel went into and out of the cameras view and then nonchalantly walks away)
 Rachel: (entering) Hi you guys!
 Rachel: Oh it was great. Mark is so sweet.
 Rachel: Oh Ross come on. Hes happily married. His wife just had twins.
 Rachel: He offered me one.
 Rachel: I know its amazing. Its amazing. Its so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
 Rachel: The job is in Paris. (they all stare at each other)
 Rachel: He offered me one.
 Rachel: The job is in Paris. (we see Ross stare in disbelief)
 Rachel: Oh God! Please somebody say something.
 Rachel: I know its huge and its scary and its... really far far away from you guys but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And Ive already talked to them about our situation with Emma and they said theyll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
 Rachel: I mean Ill fly back and forth theyll fly you out... Anything we want.
 Rachel: Thank you! Thank you!
 Rachel: I think it is. (Ross looks very sad. Phoebe and Joey enter.)
 Rachel: I got a really incredible job offer.
 Rachel: Its in Paris.
 Rachel: Look you guys... this is really really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
 Rachel: (walking towards Joey) Joey it would mean so...
 Rachel: Joey...
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: Oh well she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
 Rachel: Oh you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called and gave me my job back!
 Rachel: Yee. I mean it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean that place must have been falling apart without me.
 Rachel: No I’m still going.
 Rachel: When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back the offered me more money! Isn’t that great?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
 Rachel: Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
 Rachel: Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said well do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I dont even know what department that guys in.
 Rachel: Well I took it.
 Rachel: (hesitant) Ye-ah. Yeah! You know the moneys great. Its certainly the easier choice...
 Rachel: Yeah you know was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh absolutely... Oh...! Yeah but you know this is... its fine. Im fine going back to a job where Ive pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can... (she sits down and Ross who is stunned to hear all this follows her example)
 Rachel: Well yeah but I mean it was good scared though you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good. (they both stare around)
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: You really think so?
 Rachel: But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
 Rachel: All right. ALL RIGHT! Im gonna do it. Im gonna go to Paris.
 Rachel: Yeah! Im going to Paris. Thank you Ross!
 Rachel: Oh! Oh Im so happy.
 Rachel: Ok! Cant believe Im risking this again but youre on! All right Joe you remember the rules! Heads I win tails you lose.
 Rachel: Oh that sounds good!
 Rachel: Its all done!
 Rachel: I know... Honey seriously I did it all. The luggage that Im taking is in the bedroom this is Emmas Paris stuff these are the boxes that Im having shipped and thats the sandwich that I made for the plane...
 Rachel: Oh well. Everything that I need (she takes her bag) is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
 Rachel: It should be right next to my plane ticket.
 Rachel: What? Maybe I put it in here (she opens her bag). Oh oh its not in there! Oh no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
 Rachel: Shoot. Oh I cant believe I did this!
 Rachel: No no no. Its ok. Im gonna be fine.
 Rachel: Well Ive been better.
 Rachel: You guys are gonna come and visit me right?
 Rachel: Im gonna miss you so much.
 Rachel: You know what? Uhm I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night but come here (they go into the guest room).
 Rachel: Oh Pheebs I dont even know where to start.
 Rachel: Oh oh. (shes holding the present a transparent bag with a white stick in it). What is this?
 Rachel: Im gonna throw this away but thank you so much for the gesture!
 Rachel: I love you Phoebe.
 Rachel: All right. Well if I gonna do this Id better keep going.
 Rachel: Ok. Monica?
 Rachel: Can you come here with me for a minute?
 Rachel: Mon... Okay... Ive gotta... just say what it is Im gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years would have happened if it wasnt for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...
 Rachel: (starts crying and speaking at the same time making it almost impossible to understand what shes saying) I wouldnt know what Im gonna do without you...
 Rachel: (says something that cannot be understood)
 Rachel: I... I... I... (again saying something that cannot be understood)
 Rachel: (laughs) Oh Im sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I dont get.
 Rachel: Well these arent mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
 Rachel: Well I think youre forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
 Rachel: (to Chandler) Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
 Rachel: Oh honey...
 Rachel: (all mushy) Oh you know what? Lets not say anything else. I love you. (they hug)
 Rachel: Okay. Oh...
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Oh... (holding Rosss shoulder) Well...
 Rachel: I think Im gonna take off. (pats Ross on his back but he looks very surprised)
 Rachel: Oh you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Ross...
 Rachel: You really think I didnt say goodbye to you because I dont care?
 Rachel: I cannot believe that after ten years you do not know ONE thing about me.
 Rachel: Because it is too damn hard Ross. I cant even begin to explain to you how much Im gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day it makes me not want to go... Okay so if you think that I didnt say goodbye to you because you dont mean as much to me as everybody else youre wrong. Its because you mean more to me. So there all right theres your goodbye... Oh!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: WHAT?
 Rachel: So if you think I didnt say goodbye to you because you dont mean as much to me as everybody else youre wrong. Its because you mean more to me.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
 Rachel: It really was. Youve learned some new moves!
 Rachel: Ah.
 Rachel: I know!
 Rachel: Morning!
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Good. You?
 Rachel: Chick and the duck? Didnt they die...
 Rachel: You too. Last night was just wonderful.
 Rachel: I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
 Rachel: Uh-huh. I know. It was just it was just the perfect way to say goodbye. (She hugs him and Ross looks crushed.)
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my moms.
 Rachel: No we decided that I would go ahead and set up first and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
 Rachel: Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck Emma!
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: (touched) Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way but I do. And and when Im in a café having coffee or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun Ill think of you. Aw.
 Rachel: Oh... Bye guys.
 Rachel: Hi! You guys the car-service just got here. I cant believe theyre not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: Hi! Oh my gosh!
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: What... What...
 Rachel: Aw..
 Rachel: Oh my gosh. Wow so beautiful.
 Rachel: Oh you guys I cant believe this. But Ill leave now or Im gonna miss my plane.
 Rachel: Me too. Oh Im just sorry Im not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright I cant say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.
 Rachel: I will. Ross come here.
 Rachel: I just want you to know.. Last night.. Ill never forget it.
 Rachel: Alright now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh theyre gonna really hate me over there.
 Rachel: Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasnt gonna remember any of my high-school French but I understood every word you just said!
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Oh shoot. I had it. Oh I cant believe this.
 Rachel: I have it I have it I have it. Oh okay I cant find it but I remember that I was in seat 32C because thats my bra-size.
 Rachel: Okay fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D we would not be having this problem.
 Rachel: Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
 Rachel: Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! Youre a different person.
 Rachel: Hello?
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Phoebe? Is everything okay?
 Rachel: What? Why?
 Rachel: Oh honey Im sure theres nothing wrong with the plane.
 Rachel: Alright look I have to go. I love you and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.
 Rachel: Oh that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.
 Rachel: I wouldnt worry about it. Shes always coming up with stuff like this and you know what? Shes almost never right.
 Rachel: Well...
 Rachel: Wait what are you doing?
 Rachel: Could I get some peanuts?
 Rachel: This is ridiculous! I...
 Rachel: Yeah okay.
 Rachel: Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
 Rachel: What? What? Ross youre scaring me. Whats going on?
 Rachel: Yeah?

 Rachel: Im so sorry.
 Rachel: (on the answering machine) Ross hi. Its me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. Its just that I wasnt expecting to see you and all of a sudden youre there and saying these things... And... And now Im just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said and I didnt. I mean I didnt even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh Ive gotta see you. Ive gotta get off this plane.

 Rachel: I do love you.
 Rachel: Okay. Cause this is where I wanna be okay? No more messing around. I dont wanna mess this up again.
 Rachel: Okay. You and me alright? This is it.
 Rachel: I know. It seems smaller somehow.
 Rachel: (crying) Do you guys have to go to the new house right away or do you have some time?
 Rachel: Okay should we get some coffee?
 Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
 Rachel: Yeah well word of advice Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time youre gonna find yourself sitting at home listening to that album alone.
 Rachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
 Rachel: Oh God oh God oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under the couch cushions.)
 Rachel: Oh like I wasnt dreading tomorrow enough having to give it back to him... Hi Barry! Remember me? Im the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family! Oh God and now Im gonna have to return the ring without the ring which makes it so much harder...
 Rachel: I know I had it this morning and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...

 Rachel: Well not myself but I know other people that have. Ok you caught me. Im a laundry virgin.
 Rachel: (holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok Well what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
 Rachel: Ok I know this is gonna sound really stupid but I feel that if I can do this you know if I can actually do my own laundry there isnt anything I cant do.
 Rachel: What uh-oh?
 Rachel: Ross whats the matter?
 Rachel: Come on show me.
 Rachel: Oh everythings pink.
 Rachel: Except it didnt. It happened to me. Oh god Im gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My fathers right. I cant live on my own! I cant even do laundry!

 Rachel: I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also its an extra seat around the coffee table.
 Rachel: Okay uh you let me go grocery shopping and I buy laundry detergent but its not the one with the easy-pour spout.
 Rachel: ..Youre youre mah mah mah what?
 Rachel: Who is being loud?
 Rachel: Ooh do I sense a little bit of resentment?
 Rachel: Oh Joey you know what no-one is gonna be able to tell.
 Rachel: Uh Mon you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
 Rachel: Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
 Rachel: Everybody? Shh shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
 Rachel: Wow this is so cool you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
 Rachel: Wow you guys this is big.
 Rachel: That had to hurt!
 Rachel: Alright somebody.
 Rachel: Um... Ross?
 Rachel: Oh come on I already went.
 Rachel: Oh alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh the foot of the bed.
 Rachel: I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion you know where you have to have somebody right there in the middle of a theme park.
 Rachel: There well see? Barry wouldnt even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
 Rachel: No he said we were holding up the people behind us.
 Rachel: I mean do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
 Rachel: Yeah right.
 Rachel: (sigh) OK.
 Rachel: You dont.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: You do?
 Rachel: Oh Ross youre so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)
 Rachel: What are you shushing?
 Rachel: Ahhhh!
 Rachel: Huh. (she agrees but looks very confused)
 Rachel: Hmmm... this is so nice.
 Rachel: OK.
 Rachel: Ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind Ross)
 Rachel: Oh look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross)
 Rachel: During a blackout? Hed get trampled!
 Rachel: Oh. (they knock at the next door Mr. Heckles answers) Hi. We just found this cat and were looking for the owner.
 Rachel: Bob Buttons?
 Rachel: Here kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
 Rachel: Wow. (she exhales in amazement blowing the candle out)
 Rachel: (entering with Paolo arm in arm) Everybody this is Paolo. Paolo I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
 Rachel: And Joey....
 Rachel: And Ross.
 Rachel: (proudly) He doesnt speak much English.
 Rachel: Look at that!
 Rachel: Oh... Italy I think.
 Rachel: Well the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolos cat!
 Rachel: Oh I found him. He was Paolos cat.
 Rachel: Ah Paolo this is Phoebe.
 Rachel: I have absolutely no idea.
 Rachel: (to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God you guys what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
 Rachel: God the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
 Rachel: Yknow I know its totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common and we dont even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
 Rachel: Um... yeah. Well I mean when I first met you yknow I thought maybe possibly you might be...
 Rachel: Yeah but then you spent Phoebes entire birthday party talking to my breasts so then I figured maybe not.
 Rachel: Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno caro mio.
 Rachel: Monica your dad just beeped in but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) Im talking to Rome.
 Rachel: (exasperated) Yes Chandler thats exactly what it is. Its your hair.
 Rachel: So um did she...
 Rachel: Aw. Hey Pheebs want this? (Gives her a pencil)
 Rachel: Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
 Rachel: Oh you-you mean your earrings?
 Rachel: (sticking her foot out) Hm-m.
 Rachel: Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
 Rachel: Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
 Rachel: (humouring him) Oh well you know who I love the most?
 Rachel: You!
 Rachel: (still trapped under Ross) Pheebs could you maybe hand me a cracker?
 Rachel: Hey whos this little naked guy?
 Rachel: Aww look at the little thing.
 Rachel: Wow Monica you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
 Rachel: Terry I I I know that I havent worked here very long but I was wondering do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
 Rachel: Its so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See every year we go skiing in Vail and normally my father pays for my ticket but I sort of started the whole independence thing you know which is actually why I took this job.
 Rachel: Ok I I hear what youre sayin. Im with you. Um but I but Im trying really hard. And I think Im doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? (everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh look at that.
 Rachel: Excuse me sir. Hi you come in here all time. I was just wondering do you think theres a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
 Rachel: Ok ok thats fine. Fine. Hey Im sorry about that spill before. (picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go.
 Rachel: Absolutely. Shoop shoop shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
 Rachel: Yeah well it was. I I broke a cup.
 Rachel: No not even close. Forget Vail forget seeing my family forget shoop shoop shoop.
 Rachel: Thanks you can just put it on the table.
 Rachel: Thanks you can just put it on the table.
 Rachel: Oh my god oh you guys are great.
 Rachel: Thank you. Thank you so much!
 Rachel: Wait wait Chandler this is what youre havin for Thanksgiving dinner? What what what is it with you and this holiday?

 Rachel: I cant I gotta go.
 Rachel: Ok.
 Rachel: I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
 Rachel: Were waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
 Rachel: Yes you do. When we left you said got the keys.
 Rachel: No no no you said got the keys.
 Rachel: Oh I gotta get my ticket!
 Rachel: (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right listen smirky. If it wasnt for you and your stupid balloon I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But Im not.
 Rachel: No I didnt. I wouldnt say I had the keys unless I had the keys and I obviously didnt have the keys.
 Rachel: Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
 Rachel: Well you should have.
 Rachel: Because!
 Rachel: Because!
 Rachel: Oh god this is great! The plane is gone so it looks like Im stuck here with you guys.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: By all means.
 Rachel: And a crappy New Year.
 Rachel: (through wall) Ooh... I love Barbados!
 Rachel: I know Im her!
 Rachel: ooh...
 Rachel: Hey you know before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
 Rachel: What? Ross and Charlie? (Joey nods) Wow! Shes really making her way through the group huh? Ah who am I to talk?
 Rachel: Oh ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows were just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. (Joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) Thats not nonchalant!
 Rachel: Oh... okay just hide!
 Rachel: Coming! Try under the bed try under the bed!
 Rachel: Theres no room under the bed. (looks around because she cant find Joey anymore)
 Rachel: Yeah... (still looking to see where Joey went and opens the door)
 Rachel: Hi...
 Rachel: ...I really dont... (looks around again)
 Rachel: Yeah sure... (looks outside into the corridor if Joey is there)
 Rachel: (clearly not listening and still trying to find out where Joey went) Uh-huh... right... yeah...
 Rachel: (still searching) Oh I know... I know its been really hard for you.
 Rachel: (now looking up at the ceiling) That is hard to say Ross. That is hard to say.
 Rachel: You would think!
 Rachel: Joey!
 Rachel: (still cant find him) How are you doing this?
 Rachel: How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
 Rachel: Ah what is this? Well lets see we kissed for ten minutes and now were talking to our friends about it so I guess this is sixth grade!
 Rachel: All right look you guys... Look we appreciate all the advice but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...
 Rachel: Sure...
 Rachel: Get out!
 Rachel: Are they right?
 Rachel: Yeah... Yeah we can wait we dont have to do anything tonight.
 Rachel: (Joey walks to the door) Although...
 Rachel: I mean you know... Ross and I havent dated in like... six years...
 Rachel: Plus you know he is with Charlie now.
 Rachel: No...
 Rachel: Yeah...
 Rachel: Forgotten.
 Rachel: Nothing...
 Rachel: Nothing... Its really... Its nothing... Come here come here...
 Rachel: Sorry I just uhm... I cant seem to get Ross out of my head...
 Rachel: Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
 Rachel: Okay well keep in mind that by the time youre done theyll probably be serving dinner.
 Rachel: Still nervous?
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Yeah yeah sure! Yeah! (mouths Good luck to Joey and gets up from her seat)
 Rachel: So hi!
 Rachel: So you eh you talked to Joey?
 Rachel: Oh! Thats great!
 Rachel: Oh so everythings okay?
 Rachel: Ah... Well obviously I think so too.
 Rachel: Really? Excited?
 Rachel: Excuse me! (and she walks back to Joey who is still looking very impressed about what Ross said to him. Rachel looks at him and hits him.) You didnt tell him did you?
 Rachel: Oh God! Alright fine. You know what Joey forget it. When we go back to New York I will tell him.
 Rachel: That was one time Ross and they were only like 5 milligrams.
 Rachel: Aaah... Ross actually theres something that I really need to talk to you about.
 Rachel: Okay uhm... alright heres the deal.
 Rachel: What? What is it?
 Rachel: Uh look Ross this really isnt easy.
 Rachel: Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
 Rachel: Well yeah... Okay look its about me and...
 Rachel: Wow! Well clearly this is not a good time.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Well I tried but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now its your turn again.
 Rachel: Yeah cause thats what we do.
 Rachel: Okay that sounds fair. It just means that once again we cant...
 Rachel: No! Of course we can wait. Alright so I guess that means good night then?
 Rachel: Goo--ood night!
 Rachel: Seriously good night!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: We werent doing anything!
 Rachel: Shhh.
 Rachel: No come on that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
 Rachel: Yeah you started it! Ive got to chill.
 Rachel: We feel so terrible about this Ross.
 Rachel: Ross? (to Joey) Can we just close the door?
 Rachel: Ross say something. Anything.
 Rachel: No no no!
 Rachel: Ross this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
 Rachel: No but you know what I mean.
 Rachel: Calm ourselves?
 Rachel: Well what would we be doing?
 Rachel: Feel me up?
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Oh you bet.
 Rachel: Okay well we brought you some wine.
 Rachel: Well maybe the next batch we could all get some.
 Rachel: No awareness.
 Rachel: Look Charlie I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know he normally doesnt drink like this.
 Rachel: Ross you dont even have oven mitts on!
 Rachel: Ooy.
 Rachel: Oh my god are we supposed to answer?
 Rachel: Ross you dont seem okay.
 Rachel: Oh thats okay girls tend not to like me.
 Rachel: You know what Ross? I think were gonna take off too.
 Rachel: No no its just that its getting late...
 Rachel: Yeah thats probably a good idea.
 Rachel: Uh-huh. Okay. You know what Joey I dont think hes ever gonna be okay with this.
 Rachel: Thanks for dinner.
 Rachel: So.
 Rachel: I say ‘cheesy line’ but ok.
 Rachel: I am sorry I don’t know I am sorry I don’t know why I did that!
 Rachel: Ok so sorry.
 Rachel: I am sorry! Again... I dont know I don’t know what happened I must be nervous!
 Rachel: Ok ok ok. I promise I promise I promise I won’t do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.
 Rachel: Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a little weird it’s you and it’s me its just gonna take some getting used to.
 Rachel: Ok let’s work from the top down! (Joey nods but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra Joe!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Ow!
 Rachel: Well this is romantic!
 Rachel: It’s a standard issue bra clasp!
 Rachel: Ok well well Im really Im sorry about that Joey but do you think that maybe on some level you dont want to take off my bra?
 Rachel: (laughing) oooh! Oh oh!
 Rachel: oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
 Rachel: Well it was good.. until we got back to our apartment and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!
 Rachel: Well it wasnt just me alright? He freaked out too! He couldnt even undo my bra!
 Rachel: I do not know whats wrong with us I mean we have kissed before and thats been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
 Rachel: (looking thoughtful) Ok thats true. Thats true we can do this. Youre right youre right we can do this. Were just gonna power through!
 Rachel: (To Joey) No need!! Problem solved we are powering through (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment).
 Rachel: Hey! Got champagne?
 Rachel: Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket the phone is off the hook and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove her bra from under her clothes)...
 Rachel: Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy sexy very sexy sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey clearly very excited) Alright! Lets do it!
 Rachel: Oh! Get over it soldier weve gotta do this! (She pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like that huh?
 Rachel: You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively putting her knees next to Joeys hips.) Lets take this into high gear (She pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)
 Rachel: Yeah baby Ill show you how we do it!
 Rachel: What? Oh my God! Im so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
 Rachel: What is the matter with us?
 Rachel: No I mean with us you know. I mean is it supposed to be this... difficult?
 Rachel: Hi! Hey listen can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
 Rachel: No no no... No I mean... se-x-u-ally...
 Rachel: Well just because it happened that way for them doesnt mean it has to happen that way for us.
 Rachel: Right totally.
 Rachel: Yeah and if doesnt work then well be just one of those couples that never have sex.
 Rachel: I know.
 Rachel: Hmmm... Me too...
 Rachel: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
 Rachel: Aah... I bet youre right.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Love you too... Alright Im going to bed.
 Rachel: Wait you cant go away this weekend! Its Emmas birthday!
 Rachel: Were having a party.
 Rachel: No that day... that wont be her real birthday!
 Rachel: Well cant you just go to Vermont the next day?
 Rachel: And I mean you know you guys... This is a big deal. I mean how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
 Rachel: You know Pheebs when I was little on my birthday my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find em all.
 Rachel: Oh good good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and well give it to her when she is 18.
 Rachel: Oh no its still nap time. But shell be up soon.
 Rachel: I said its still nap time.
 Rachel: Hey Joey will you please set this up for people to put Emmas presents on?
 Rachel: Oh shes still napping
 Rachel: Look I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isnt a really big deal to you but it really is to us ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.
 Rachel: No really she didnt sleep well last night so we cant wake her up.
 Rachel: Oh! Emma might like what?
 Rachel: What did you get her?
 Rachel: Well this sounds like fun! Well you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap so would you mind performing them once now?
 Rachel: (to everybody) All right let’s get this party started huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
 Rachel: So Joey what are you gonna do for us?
 Rachel: Oh ok which one?
 Rachel: (crying) Wow! That was amazing!
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
 Rachel: Is that it?
 Rachel: Ross um don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s in a box in the fridge.
 Rachel: Oh youre gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey Corino’s.
 Rachel: Well anyway they make these great novelty cakes in all different shapes and if you give them a photo they’ll copy it in icing!
 Rachel: Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
 Rachel: Ross what are you talking about? (she sees the cake) oh! Oh my God! They put my baby’s face on a penis!
 Rachel: Why you guys this isnt funny all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
 Rachel: Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back I dont even want it in my home... (Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a piece and yells at him) Joey dont touch it!!
 Rachel: (speaking to the person on the phone again) Yes yes. I still want my daughters picture but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake chocolate frosting with nuts!
 Rachel: (into the phone) No there isnt time to go to the bakery. Were just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright well just tell Emma were gonna be there as soon as we can. (emotionally) Bye...
 Rachel: OOH! God! Sorry!
 Rachel: Emmas awake.
 Rachel: I cant believe this. This is her first birthday. Shes awake. Were not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
 Rachel: Oh why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
 Rachel: (shakes her head) I guess... Oh I just had such an idea of what this day would be like you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing Happy Birthday. Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! (honks furiously and Ross looks at her in disbelief and Rachel looks at him.) They have to learn!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: (she looks at the cake) Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
 Rachel: Well Im very impressed.
 Rachel: I dont care that you left. Im just glad that youre here. Thanks you guys!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh! Emma thats right! Youre that many!
 Rachel: (angrily) NO no science camp!
 Rachel: Oh!... Oh and Emma look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
 Rachel: Oh yeah nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Okay. (they both look into the camera and Ross waves.) Hi Emma. Well your first birthday is over and it was really...
 Rachel: You know Im thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.
 Rachel: Ive never given her a cookie. Have you?
 Rachel: Of course Id be honored!
 Rachel: OH! Whats it the anniversary of? Your first date your first kiss first time you had sex...
 Rachel: Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! (they hug) Wow! You remember Joey?
 Rachel: So now what are you doing here?
 Rachel: (Emma starts crying in the other room) Oh sorry hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
 Rachel: God!
 Rachel: Oh I know isnt she?
 Rachel: All right. Whats your news Amy?
 Rachel: What? Oh my God! To who?
 Rachel: A-And??
 Rachel: No whats he like?
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Huh... wow so hes gotta be...
 Rachel: Sweety I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
 Rachel: Oh... sit down sit down. Oh honey you know I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?
 Rachel: Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm so but anyway listen not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever ever made. Honey you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there somewhere. Someone that is your age that is smart that is fun and that you care about!
 Rachel: Ok.
 Rachel: Ok let’s keep talking.
 Rachel: Amy hi!
 Rachel: Oh good for you!
 Rachel: Yes you are! Oh I am so proud of you!
 Rachel: But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
 Rachel: Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron get off!’
 Rachel: Joey I can’t do that!
 Rachel: Well Joey uhm look I know that she’s difficult but I think it’s really good that she’s here.
 Rachel: No its just... look you know when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
 Rachel: Well uhm... whatever I have really appreciated it cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience but that’s ok.
 Rachel: Amy that’s what I was supposed to wear today that’s why I hung it on the door.
 Rachel: Amy you know what? I was thinking that maybe now itd be a good time for us to sit down and you know talk about your future.
 Rachel: Well what happened?
 Rachel: Oh that is so tacky.
 Rachel: Phoebe that’s huge!
 Rachel: I think it could be kind of great!
 Rachel: (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands together faking excitement)
 Rachel: (Takes the phone) Oh! Thats interesting since she died seven years ago!!
 Rachel: (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh its our nanny! (goes back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok bye! (Hangs up) (To Ross) Thats Molly shes sick. Can you watch Emma today?
 Rachel: Menstrual cramps.
 Rachel: (To Monica Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma?
 Rachel: (To Ross) Great shoot what are we gonna do?
 Rachel: (Thinks for a moment) Well actually...
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Why not?
 Rachel: (Defends Amy) Wha.. well Ellas a nice name!
 Rachel: (Shocked) Wha... the next one?
 Rachel: Ross I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
 Rachel: Ross Im telling you shes giving up getting her eyebrows (points at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?
 Rachel: Absolutely.
 Rachel: (To Emma) Hey! Hi hows my girl?
 Rachel: (sounds excited) Yeah!
 Rachel: (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!?
 Rachel: You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?
 Rachel: Oh my God Oh my God here comes Ross. Hes gonna flip out.
 Rachel: Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emmas head and half her face with it)
 Rachel: Nah I dont really want her to see.
 Rachel: Nothing.
 Rachel: Oh theyre real!
 Rachel: I know I know and you were right Ross. (To Amy) You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
 Rachel: I cant believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
 Rachel: Oh yeah? Since when?
 Rachel: (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What?
 Rachel: (shouting) Babies dont care if theyre slim.
 Rachel: Joey get Amys bags she is moving out!
 Rachel: You put holes in my babys ears!
 Rachel: (gasps) I cant believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
 Rachel: Excuse me?
 Rachel: (yelling) Joey where are those bags?
 Rachel: (doesnt believe what shes hearing) Seriously?
 Rachel: Hips or thighs?
 Rachel: (gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
 Rachel: (embarrassed) Oh I can give you that.
 Rachel: Yeah. I just I kept trying to make you a better person but youre... youre already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
 Rachel: Did you just say Emma?
 Rachel: So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
 Rachel: Thats shocking!
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: My God!
 Rachel: Congratulations! Wow!!
 Rachel: Mmh-mmh!
 Rachel: Oh Pheebs baby thats nice but you know what I think Im ok. Why dont you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?
 Rachel: (angrily) GIVE ME THE BOOK! (she takes it and start reading) Pablo Diaz Brady Smith huh Guy-in-van?
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Phoebe isnt Jethro Tull a band?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Im sorry this sounds like something Im never gonna be interested in.
 Rachel: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it but your bosses didnt. Then that way youre the good guy and theyre the bad guys.
 Rachel: Whos Gladys?
 Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
 Rachel: Well I mean sure of course. But... you already gave that to Monica so...
 Rachel: No I couldnt let you do that.
 Rachel: But I dont want you to.
 Rachel: But I insist harder!
 Rachel: (sarcastic) No no thats ok. You won fair and square. Im so sad!
 Rachel: Did you watch the tape?
 Rachel: But you are a liar.
 Rachel: Well this is going well. (Chandler looks worried)
 Rachel: (surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh shes so nice and big! Oh Monica where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly? (looks around for a spot)
 Rachel: Well hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to the spot where her famous French poster is hanging). That way it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
 Rachel: (jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! Theres nothing above your bed!!
 Rachel: O-oh my God!
 Rachel: Joey what... is... this...thing... doing here?
 Rachel: Joey were not keeping this!
 Rachel: Alright fine. You can keep it. As long as you dont mind that shes haunted.
 Rachel: Well legend has it Joey that... she comes alive when youre asleep.
 Rachel: She climbs out of the frame and then drags her half-a-body across the floor just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky slow voice) And then with her one good hand she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
 Rachel: Well why I told him its haunted. Two can play at this game. (gives Gladys to Monica)
 Rachel: Yes I can! (pushes her back again)
 Rachel: Shes yours!
 Rachel: Shes yours!
 Rachel: Shes mine!
 Rachel: Shes mine!
 Rachel: I want Gladys!
 Rachel: Shes mine!
 Rachel: Shes mine!
 Rachel: Excellent!
 Rachel: Ha ha ha third time this week. Man this does not get old.
 Rachel: Oh dont be such a baby!
 Rachel: Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
 Rachel: Oh hey Ross... Listen I heard about you and Charlie. Im really sorry.
 Rachel: Absolutely.
 Rachel: So uhm... what are you gonna do today?
 Rachel: Oh my God what!?
 Rachel: Ok look Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
 Rachel: (upset) All right well if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
 Rachel: Yes I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! (crying) And it was uneven for weeks!
 Rachel: Ok fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
 Rachel: Ross those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When youre... and there is that moment when you are at the top when you just dont know if youre gonna return back to earth!
 Rachel: All right!
 Rachel: Irrational huh? All right well I’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
 Rachel: Ok careful.
 Rachel: Careful watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
 Rachel: I know (she touches Emma’s head) but they’re just so beautiful! Oh my God I just pulled one out.
 Rachel: Ok.
 Rachel: Ok.
 Rachel: Ok careful ok. (Emma giggles) Oh she’s smiling! Oh my God she does like it!
 Rachel: Awe! (Emma laughs) Oh my God! Looks she’s a little dare-devil! Oh let me push can I push?
 Rachel: Ok. Oh God. (To Ross) Get the camera it’s in the diaper bag.
 Rachel: Oh oh Ross oh my God are you okay?
 Rachel: Ross see! I told you those swings are evil! Alright that is it. That is 
 Rachel: Ross cmon please. Can we just get out of here before somebody else gets 
 Rachel: (looks at him suspiciously) I know what this is all about... Youve always been 
 Rachel: Alright fine. Ill do it.
 Rachel: If you hold a spider.
 Rachel: IF you hold a spider.
 Rachel: Ok... I got a spider. There were two I picked the bigger one.
 Rachel: Ok... (and passes the spider to Ross who holds it in between his hands)
 Rachel: (reluctantly) Ok... O-k...
 Rachel: (more confident) Ok...
 Rachel: whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
 Rachel: A-alright! I can do this.
 Rachel: Thats because hes on your neck.
 Rachel: ROSS!
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: I cant believe this! This is Emmas first Thanksgiving!
 Rachel: Its not? (whispering to Ross) When was she born?
 Rachel: Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
 Rachel: Did you at least win the contest?
 Rachel: Cant wait!
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Well lets see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
 Rachel: Oh my God! Thats the creepiest thing Ive ever heard!
 Rachel: Oh! Phoebe all babies are beautiful!
 Rachel: Phoebe just the idea of pitting one baby against another I mean you know and judging whos cuter just for a trophy...
 Rachel: And a thousand dollars.
 Rachel: ...is something Im very interested in! Oh please do not tell Ross. He still believes that (in a deep voice mocking Ross) whats in the inside is important...
 Rachel: Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
 Rachel: Oh take the clothes of Joeys Cabbage Patch Kid.
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe listen. Well I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. Ive been watching this guy over there I dont think he came with a kid!
 Rachel: Phoebe I think... Its just too weird I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe! Come on! You know what its already three oclock and they havent even gotten to Emmas group yet. We gotta go we got dinner!
 Rachel: Phoebe you have to calm down.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: You heard them say that?
 Rachel: All right okay. Alright lets give to these babies something to cry about!
 Rachel: No what?
 Rachel: No Phoebe I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
 Rachel: Because I already did!
 Rachel: No...
 Rachel: What are you doing here!
 Rachel: And I won!
 Rachel: Yes! (spells it) Y-E-S. Yes!
 Rachel: Yeah. Thats me!
 Rachel: She won a thousand dollars!
 Rachel: Well I dont know you guys figure it out I got to put Emma down for a nap.
 Rachel: Alright Emma is napping... (then to Ross) what happened to your shirt?
 Rachel: You know what we just say that she said it was 5 oclock. Well just act casual. Were not late were right on time. (When she finishes talking a note is pushed from under Monicas and Chandlers door into the hall. Ross picks it up and reads it out loud)
 Rachel: Oh God. This is bad. This is so bad.
 Rachel: Oh hey I have an idea. Why dont we play rock-paper-scissors and whoever loses goes in first. (they all agree) Ready? (they do the rock-paper-scissor thing with they hands and Rachel has paper Phoebe and Ross both have rock while Joey is doing a strange upward wiggling with his fingers. They all look a him confused).
 Rachel: Alright enough enough come on. Lets just all go in at the same time.
 Rachel: Alright come on... (starts to knock on the door) Alright you guys. Were so sorry were late. Please let us in so we can have dinner together.
 Rachel: You guys come on it doesnt matter why were late. Were all here now please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. (A slice of turkey on a piece of aluminum foil is slid under door)
 Rachel: (gasps) Oh I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
 Rachel: Huh... OH MY GOD ITS BRUSSELS SPROUTS. (they all look appalled)
 Rachel: Oh I know... I still have my old key! (She goes in to get it and comes back with her keys) We can just unlock the door.
 Rachel: You know what? I dont want to be with them either but its Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together together. (Goes to unlock the door)
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: So bad.
 Rachel: Dessert?
 Rachel: Congratulatioooons!
 Rachel: Ewww is that what that is?
 Rachel: Yeah! Ill cook!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: I lent them to Ross.
 Rachel: Im so happy for you!
 Rachel: To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: (to Joey) Hey whos Phoebe with?
 Rachel: Do you think Im someone else?
 Rachel: Well believe it or not its true. When Joey and I were together he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out he didnt sleep with anybody else!
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Well its a little low... pick up a little... (Ross picks it up) a little bit more... (he picks it up again) a little bit more... (he takes it off) There you go! (pause) Now throw it away!
 Rachel: Ross please trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now I dont know whos running for president or who that... NATO guy is but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
 Rachel: Hi
 Rachel: what?
 Rachel: Oh! Oh no!
 Rachel: Oh yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
 Rachel: Oh no! Not me! Emma!
 Rachel: Ah this place is great!
 Rachel: Ross look I know that some of this stuff is out there but I mean come on look at this look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). I mean this is just beautiful!
 Rachel: Yeah down from seven hundred you are saving like two hundred bucks!
 Rachel: No no no no! Ross wait! Come on! You know there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt look at these nice pants...
 Rachel: Yes they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
 Rachel: Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please just wear what I suggest and she’s gonna go nuts for you.
 Rachel: (to Phoebe) Why do men keep talking to me like this?
 Rachel: We got some really great stuff!
 Rachel: Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
 Rachel: (looking into one of her shopping bags) Oh no! I took one of Ross bags by 
 Rachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you werent there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are you are!
 Rachel: Hi sure!
 Rachel: Oh God... well it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet n Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out and thats when it hit me how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Yknow I mean I always knew looked familiar but... Anyway I just had to get out of there and I started wondering Why am I doing this and who am I doing this for?.

 Rachel: Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! Thats the difference!

 Rachel: No you have it really I dont want it-
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: I knew.

 Rachel: Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
 Rachel: Whos Nancy?
 Rachel: Are you serious?
 Rachel: What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? Im doing it Ross is doing it Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
 Rachel: Yeah it is.
 Rachel: Well it is all right? When we were out there today all I kept thinking was I cant believe Chandler is screwing this woman but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
 Rachel: (talking on the phone) Cmon Daddy listen to me! All of my life everyone has always told me Youre a shoe! Youre a shoe youre a shoe youre a shoe!. And today I just stopped and I said What if I dont wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse yknow? Or a- or a hat!

 Rachel: That is not true. She did! She forced me!
 Rachel: Well it stupid unfair question!
 Rachel: (running from the guys apartment with Joey in tow) Hey whats-whats going on?!
 Rachel: Funny because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
 Rachel: Well Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
 Rachel: Yeah I do. I-I do do that.
 Rachel: Well y’know I don’t want you to be cold.
 Rachel: And a crappy New Year.
 Rachel: You cant move. You just... you just cant.
 Rachel: Yeah. So dont move okay? Just stay here and... (nods towards Ross) maybe close your blinds at night.
 Rachel: Yeah were gonna let you be alone.
 Rachel: Aah! Why? What are these for?
 Rachel: Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful. (she got a scarf)
 Rachel: Oh God thats right. I blocked that out.
 Rachel: Oh dyou like it?
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Pheebs I... there isnt gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
 Rachel: Seriously Pheebs its not gonna be that kind of a party.
 Rachel: Nooo! Phoebe of course there is more! I mean Ill just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pees!
 Rachel: Well hes coming from Jersey he said he would get here as fast as he could!
 Rachel: (pretends to be shocked) Uh! The police!
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: All right look we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
 Rachel: No thats ok lets me just get my check book!
 Rachel: This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
 Rachel: I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight Im sooo gonna let them! (They spot Chandler)
 Rachel: It... You can so totally tell.
 Rachel: Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. (They walk towards Chandler) Hey hows it going (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails).
 Rachel: Yeah Rachel. And this (points to Monica) is Ross sister Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do).
 Rachel: Bitchin
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: I am sooo drunk.
 Rachel: (finishing the last of her drink) I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
 Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why dont I just start taking my smart pills now?
 Rachel: (blushing) Oh what a line. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards Chandler and whispers Oh my God!)
 Rachel: Oh well You know I think its kinda really important that I go somewhere where theres sun so Im sort of... (Chandler leans in an kisses her) (She pulls away) Hey!
 Rachel: (She considers it for a second) Yeah okay. (She puts her hands around his neck and they start kissing again)
 Rachel: No wait. No theres gotta be something else that you can do. I mean what skills do you have?
 Rachel: So maybe something in an office.
 Rachel: (to Phoebe) Really?
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Oh Monica made me send her to my mothers. Apparently babies and weddings dont mix.
 Rachel: Uh... November?
 Rachel: Hey Pheebs...
 Rachel: Uhm... you havent told these guys what theyre doing in the wedding yet.
 Rachel: Well this is really awkward (staring at the floor) Oh and I can leave!
 Rachel: (excited and clapping her hands in front of her face) Goody what is it!
 Rachel: What what what no I dont wanna do that.
 Rachel: Happy wedding day!
 Rachel: Ok-dokey Joey listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central all right? Were gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
 Rachel: What dyou want?
 Rachel: Oh Ross cmon please! Dont make this harder than it already is!
 Rachel: Well Chandler said that its really important to him too!
 Rachel: Oh you are the lesser of two evils!
 Rachel: Hi
 Rachel: Even so I think Im gonna pick Ross.
 Rachel: All right fine I pick you.
 Rachel: (not amused by his pun but forcing a smile anyway) Oh my...
 Rachel: Well in my defense you were not supposed to tell each other.
 Rachel: Whos there?
 Rachel: Uh.
 Rachel: You know what I cant do this. I dont know which one of you guys to pick.
 Rachel: (sarcastic) Wow this is a tough one. I think Im gonna have to go with the dog.
 Rachel: Since when do you watch the news?
 Rachel: Wow you know its so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why dont you guys just do it on the street?
 Rachel: Well look its hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldnt ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding youve always wanted!
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe Im so happy for you honey. (she gives her a kiss)
 Rachel: Geez Ross you could have showered.
 Rachel: How was the honeymoon?
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: I did not know you spoke French.
 Rachel: Oh... youre so sexy!
 Rachel: Seriously stop it or Im gonna jump on ya.
 Rachel: Ross...
 Rachel: My father had an heart attack... (crying) ...while I was at Barney’s.
 Rachel: Yeah they said hes gonna be fine but hes still heavily sedated.
 Rachel: No come on Im totally ok. (hugging him) I dont need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
 Rachel: Ok. If you really need to.
 Rachel: Oh I really could.
 Rachel: Ohh... (Ross mouths HA-HA at Monica and takes two cookies and she looks at him angrily)
 Rachel: (stopping a nurse whos coming out of a room) Oh uhm excuse me Im here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
 Rachel: Ross please this is a hospital ok? That actually means something here.
 Rachel: Can somebody please go in?
 Rachel: Ross please dont be so scared of him!
 Rachel: Oh! (They enter. Rachel sees his father lying on a bed with tubes drip and everything) Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh ohhh wow that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain huh?
 Rachel: Oh great Are you gonna be ok?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Uh. (pause) Did you call your parents?
 Rachel: Oh good.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: What do you mean? Youve been in my room before!
 Rachel: Ok I gotta tell ya its really weird when you use my whole name.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Yeah just so weird seeing him like that you know? I mean he is a doctor you dont expect doctors to get sick!
 Rachel: (shes sad) Ow. I dont want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Really I shouldnt feel guilty?
 Rachel: Ok maybe youre right.
 Rachel: Wait wait wait wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
 Rachel: Ok. (She sits on the bed and Ross sits near her) Thank you for coming with me today.
 Rachel: Rachel Green is very happy youre in her room!
 Rachel: I just dont want to be alone tonight.
 Rachel: Wait we wont know that until we do it will we?
 Rachel: Taking advantage? Im giving you the advantage enjoy!
 Rachel: Wow. Ok.
 Rachel: Mhm-mh!
 Rachel: (She turns around very slowly looks at him for a second and then turns back to her coffee) Sure. (She gives him the cup she was pouring for herself without looking at him)
 Rachel: Hmm-hmm. (starts to pour herself a cup of coffee never looking at Ross)
 Rachel: (coldly) Yep.
 Rachel: FYI..
 Rachel: In the future when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it. (she smiles fakely at him)
 Rachel: (sarcastically) Really? Well it seems to me if youd done the right thing I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
 Rachel: Oh stop that!
 Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
 Rachel: Oh really well Ross you know what? I am a big girl. I dont need someone telling me what is best for me.
 Rachel: Oh really really? Well it wasnt very good for me either. (She turns to leave and Ross over takes her and stands infront on her his back to the row of doors leading to the hospital rooms)
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh good.
 Rachel: Okay... Hey listen just before you go I-I again I just wanna say thank you for coming with me.
 Rachel: And also you know I uh I was thinking about what you said you know about the whole sex thing and... its probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
 Rachel: Its a shame though I mean when we did it it was pretty good.
 Rachel: Hey uhm do you remember that one really great time...?
 Rachel: You know it was youre uhm... birthday...
 Rachel: Well I guess thats all in the past now.
 Rachel: (after a pause) Not even one more time?
 Rachel: No matter how much we want it.
 Rachel: Thats what we decided.
 Rachel: ...Its kinda hard though!
 Rachel: You know when two people have a connection you know thats... just seems like such a... waste.
 Rachel: ...Ross?
 Rachel: Just so you know... With us... its never off the table. (she enters her room and closes the door.)
 Rachel: (while entering) Hi you guys.
 Rachel: Ooh Italian! (she also grabs a plate)
 Rachel: Hey you guys... Youre never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
 Rachel: Congratulations!
 Rachel: Ooh! (they hug)
 Rachel: (to maitre d) Hi Im here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. Its spelled like Gukki which could be confusing.
 Rachel: Oh my God! Thats my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
 Rachel: But my... but my boss cannot see me. Im interviewing for another job.
 Rachel: Sssshhhh!
 Rachel: Hi... Im on a date...
 Rachel: Yeah it is. Yeah you know its tough. Single mom career... You gotta get out there.
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Yes hi!
 Rachel: Hi! (to mr Zellner) Excuse us.
 Rachel: Okay. Oh yeah... (whispering to mr Zellner) Oh hes cute!
 Rachel: Wha... My resumé? I wouldnt... I wouldnt call my online dating profile a resumé.
 Rachel: (starts singing la la la la) Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
 Rachel: What? I-I dont.
 Rachel: No I-I-I love it there.
 Rachel: Oh! Its not good.
 Rachel: Well I didnt get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
 Rachel: Well my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that hes gonna have to let me go because Im not a team player. And I said Wait a minute! Yes I am. and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
 Rachel: Oh it... good! Yeah but Im not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
 Rachel: Ah all right. Heres to Ross!
 Rachel: (crying) No its not that. I got fired today. And I didnt get the other job.
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: No its okay you didnt know.
 Rachel: Oh thank you... (looks at his face trying to remember his name)
 Rachel: (Is embarrassed for a moment but it quickly passes) Well now I dont have to. (The man leaves instantly)
 Rachel: (annoyed) Ross what is taking you so long?
 Rachel: (turns around) Mark? Oh my God! (puts the box on the chair and they hug each other)
 Rachel: Im fantastic. You remember Ross?
 Rachel: Oh well (looks at her box and chair) youre not catching me on my best day.
 Rachel: No but its good you know Im gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
 Rachel: Well screw charity work. Whatve you got?
 Rachel: Great! Ill call ya!
 Rachel: (very excited) Oh my God!
 Rachel: Ross! Thats Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
 Rachel: Yes.
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: What? You dont want me to get a job?
 Rachel: Ugh.
 Rachel: Ross you know what? (looks over to the door and sees security staring at them) Okay lets talk about it later there comes security. (Takes her box and leaves. Ross follows her and then returns for the chair. He stands for a moment then pushes it quickly in the general direction Rachel went into and out of the cameras view and then nonchalantly walks away)
 Rachel: (entering) Hi you guys!
 Rachel: Oh it was great. Mark is so sweet.
 Rachel: Oh Ross come on. Hes happily married. His wife just had twins.
 Rachel: He offered me one.
 Rachel: I know its amazing. Its amazing. Its so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
 Rachel: The job is in Paris. (they all stare at each other)
 Rachel: He offered me one.
 Rachel: The job is in Paris. (we see Ross stare in disbelief)
 Rachel: Oh God! Please somebody say something.
 Rachel: I know its huge and its scary and its... really far far away from you guys but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And Ive already talked to them about our situation with Emma and they said theyll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
 Rachel: I mean Ill fly back and forth theyll fly you out... Anything we want.
 Rachel: Thank you! Thank you!
 Rachel: I think it is. (Ross looks very sad. Phoebe and Joey enter.)
 Rachel: I got a really incredible job offer.
 Rachel: Its in Paris.
 Rachel: Look you guys... this is really really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
 Rachel: (walking towards Joey) Joey it would mean so...
 Rachel: Joey...
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: Oh well she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
 Rachel: Oh you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called and gave me my job back!
 Rachel: Yee. I mean it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean that place must have been falling apart without me.
 Rachel: No I’m still going.
 Rachel: When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back the offered me more money! Isn’t that great?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
 Rachel: Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
 Rachel: Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said well do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I dont even know what department that guys in.
 Rachel: Well I took it.
 Rachel: (hesitant) Ye-ah. Yeah! You know the moneys great. Its certainly the easier choice...
 Rachel: Yeah you know was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh absolutely... Oh...! Yeah but you know this is... its fine. Im fine going back to a job where Ive pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can... (she sits down and Ross who is stunned to hear all this follows her example)
 Rachel: Well yeah but I mean it was good scared though you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good. (they both stare around)
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: You really think so?
 Rachel: But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
 Rachel: All right. ALL RIGHT! Im gonna do it. Im gonna go to Paris.
 Rachel: Yeah! Im going to Paris. Thank you Ross!
 Rachel: Oh! Oh Im so happy.
 Rachel: Ok! Cant believe Im risking this again but youre on! All right Joe you remember the rules! Heads I win tails you lose.
 Rachel: Oh that sounds good!
 Rachel: Its all done!
 Rachel: I know... Honey seriously I did it all. The luggage that Im taking is in the bedroom this is Emmas Paris stuff these are the boxes that Im having shipped and thats the sandwich that I made for the plane...
 Rachel: Oh well. Everything that I need (she takes her bag) is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
 Rachel: It should be right next to my plane ticket.
 Rachel: What? Maybe I put it in here (she opens her bag). Oh oh its not in there! Oh no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
 Rachel: Shoot. Oh I cant believe I did this!
 Rachel: No no no. Its ok. Im gonna be fine.
 Rachel: Well Ive been better.
 Rachel: You guys are gonna come and visit me right?
 Rachel: Im gonna miss you so much.
 Rachel: You know what? Uhm I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night but come here (they go into the guest room).
 Rachel: Oh Pheebs I dont even know where to start.
 Rachel: Oh oh. (shes holding the present a transparent bag with a white stick in it). What is this?
 Rachel: Im gonna throw this away but thank you so much for the gesture!
 Rachel: I love you Phoebe.
 Rachel: All right. Well if I gonna do this Id better keep going.
 Rachel: Ok. Monica?
 Rachel: Can you come here with me for a minute?
 Rachel: Mon... Okay... Ive gotta... just say what it is Im gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years would have happened if it wasnt for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...
 Rachel: (starts crying and speaking at the same time making it almost impossible to understand what shes saying) I wouldnt know what Im gonna do without you...
 Rachel: (says something that cannot be understood)
 Rachel: I... I... I... (again saying something that cannot be understood)
 Rachel: (laughs) Oh Im sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I dont get.
 Rachel: Well these arent mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
 Rachel: Well I think youre forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
 Rachel: (to Chandler) Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
 Rachel: Oh honey...
 Rachel: (all mushy) Oh you know what? Lets not say anything else. I love you. (they hug)
 Rachel: Okay. Oh...
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Oh... (holding Rosss shoulder) Well...
 Rachel: I think Im gonna take off. (pats Ross on his back but he looks very surprised)
 Rachel: Oh you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Ross...
 Rachel: You really think I didnt say goodbye to you because I dont care?
 Rachel: I cannot believe that after ten years you do not know ONE thing about me.
 Rachel: Because it is too damn hard Ross. I cant even begin to explain to you how much Im gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day it makes me not want to go... Okay so if you think that I didnt say goodbye to you because you dont mean as much to me as everybody else youre wrong. Its because you mean more to me. So there all right theres your goodbye... Oh!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: WHAT?
 Rachel: So if you think I didnt say goodbye to you because you dont mean as much to me as everybody else youre wrong. Its because you mean more to me.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
 Rachel: It really was. Youve learned some new moves!
 Rachel: Ah.
 Rachel: I know!
 Rachel: Morning!
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Good. You?
 Rachel: Chick and the duck? Didnt they die...
 Rachel: You too. Last night was just wonderful.
 Rachel: I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
 Rachel: Uh-huh. I know. It was just it was just the perfect way to say goodbye. (She hugs him and Ross looks crushed.)
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my moms.
 Rachel: No we decided that I would go ahead and set up first and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
 Rachel: Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck Emma!
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: (touched) Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way but I do. And and when Im in a café having coffee or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun Ill think of you. Aw.
 Rachel: Oh... Bye guys.
 Rachel: Hi! You guys the car-service just got here. I cant believe theyre not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: Hi! Oh my gosh!
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: What... What...
 Rachel: Aw..
 Rachel: Oh my gosh. Wow so beautiful.
 Rachel: Oh you guys I cant believe this. But Ill leave now or Im gonna miss my plane.
 Rachel: Me too. Oh Im just sorry Im not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright I cant say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.
 Rachel: I will. Ross come here.
 Rachel: I just want you to know.. Last night.. Ill never forget it.
 Rachel: Alright now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh theyre gonna really hate me over there.
 Rachel: Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasnt gonna remember any of my high-school French but I understood every word you just said!
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Oh shoot. I had it. Oh I cant believe this.
 Rachel: I have it I have it I have it. Oh okay I cant find it but I remember that I was in seat 32C because thats my bra-size.
 Rachel: Okay fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D we would not be having this problem.
 Rachel: Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
 Rachel: Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! Youre a different person.
 Rachel: Hello?
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Phoebe? Is everything okay?
 Rachel: What? Why?
 Rachel: Oh honey Im sure theres nothing wrong with the plane.
 Rachel: Alright look I have to go. I love you and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.
 Rachel: Oh that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.
 Rachel: I wouldnt worry about it. Shes always coming up with stuff like this and you know what? Shes almost never right.
 Rachel: Well...
 Rachel: Wait what are you doing?
 Rachel: Could I get some peanuts?
 Rachel: This is ridiculous! I...
 Rachel: Yeah okay.
 Rachel: Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
 Rachel: What? What? Ross youre scaring me. Whats going on?
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh my God.
 Rachel: I - I have to get on the plane.
 Rachel: Yes I do.
 Rachel: Theyre waiting for me Ross. I cant do this right now Im sorry. Im sorry.
 Rachel: Im so sorry.
 Rachel: (on the answering machine) Ross hi. Its me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. Its just that I wasnt expecting to see you and all of a sudden youre there and saying these things... And... And now Im just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said and I didnt. I mean I didnt even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh Ive gotta see you. Ive gotta get off this plane.
 Rachel: (on the answering machine) Excuse me?
 Rachel: (on the answering machine) Im sorry. Im really sorry but I need to get off the plane okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.
 Rachel: (on the answering machine) Oh please miss you dont understand!

 Rachel: I got off the plane.
 Rachel: I do love you.
 Rachel: Okay. Cause this is where I wanna be okay? No more messing around. I dont wanna mess this up again.
 Rachel: Okay. You and me alright? This is it.
 Rachel: I know. It seems smaller somehow.
 Rachel: (crying) Do you guys have to go to the new house right away or do you have some time?
 Rachel: Okay should we get some coffee?
 Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
 Rachel: Yeah well word of advice Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time youre gonna find yourself sitting at home listening to that album alone.
 Rachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
 Rachel: Oh God oh God oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under the couch cushions.)
 Rachel: Oh like I wasnt dreading tomorrow enough having to give it back to him... Hi Barry! Remember me? Im the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family! Oh God and now Im gonna have to return the ring without the ring which makes it so much harder...
 Rachel: I know I had it this morning and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
 Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh dont be mad...
 Rachel: Oh I am sorry...
 Rachel: Oh but look how straight those noodles are!
 Rachel: Well now how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
 Rachel: So what are you gonna do?
 Rachel: Youre twins?
 Rachel: All right you guys I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.)
 Rachel: The lights please..
 Rachel: Im just cleaning up.
 Rachel: Uh.. okay sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)
 Rachel: Oh.. a little..
 Rachel: A lot.

 Rachel: That had to hurt!
 Rachel: Alright somebody.
 Rachel: Um... Ross?
 Rachel: Oh come on I already went.
 Rachel: Oh alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh the foot of the bed.
 Rachel: I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion you know where you have to have somebody right there in the middle of a theme park.
 Rachel: There well see? Barry wouldnt even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
 Rachel: No he said we were holding up the people behind us.
 Rachel: I mean do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
 Rachel: Yeah right.

 Rachel: You dont.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: You do?
 Rachel: Oh Ross youre so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)
 Rachel: What are you shushing?
 Rachel: Ahhhh!
 Rachel: Huh. (she agrees but looks very confused)
 Rachel: Hmmm... this is so nice.
 Rachel: OK.

 Rachel: Oh I found him. He was Paolos cat.
 Rachel: Ah Paolo this is Phoebe.
 Rachel: I have absolutely no idea.
 Rachel: (to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God you guys what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
 Rachel: God the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
 Rachel: Yknow I know its totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common and we dont even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
 Rachel: Um... yeah. Well I mean when I first met you yknow I thought maybe possibly you might be...
 Rachel: Yeah but then you spent Phoebes entire birthday party talking to my breasts so then I figured maybe not.
 Rachel: Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno caro mio.
 Rachel: Monica your dad just beeped in but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) Im talking to Rome.

 Rachel: Monica what are you doing?
 Rachel: (entering) Hey.
 Rachel: Do you have any ice?
 Rachel: Yeah I know. I had the greatest day though I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
 Rachel: Hmm. (she opens the freezer) Umm why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
 Rachel: But ah you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer?
 Rachel: How often do you read it?
 Rachel: Well umm I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that’s a classic what’s so great about The Shining?
 Rachel: Okay. Ah well we’ll just see about that okay. I will read The Shining (she tries to take the book away from him but he doesn’t want to let it go) and you will read Little Women.
 Rachel: All right.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Oh Danny just went into room 217.
 Rachel: Oh no meh-nah-nah-nah come on you’re gonna ruin it!
 Rachel: Joey! I can’t believe you just did that!
 Rachel: All right okay Laurie proposes to Jo and she says no even though she’s still in love with him and then he ends up marring Amy.
 Rachel: Eh. Beth dies.
 Rachel: Um-hmm.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: No. She doesn’t die.
 Rachel: Because I wanted to hurt you.
 Rachel: (gasps) Oh my....
 Rachel: (screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) Sorry. I’m sorry.
 Rachel: I’m sorry I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Awwww.
 Rachel: Joey?
 Rachel: Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Hi sweetie!
 Rachel: I’ve got some bad news.
 Rachel: I can get a quick bite to eat but then I have to come back up here.
 Rachel: Nooo he’s leaving for a better job.
 Rachel: Well we’re gonna miss you around here.
 Rachel: Yeah you bet.
 Rachel: Funny book?
 Rachel: Yeah at the lecture I told you that last week you said you didn’t mind.
 Rachel: Oh please tell me it’s not because I’m going with Mark.
 Rachel: Oh my God!!! Ross!!
 Rachel: Because he’s my friend.
 Rachel: Okay well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler can I play with Mark?
 Rachel: I don’t know you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny. Look honey Mark is in fashion okay I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
 Rachel: Really!?
 Rachel: Okay. Honey I would love for you to go with me. (Ross has a worried look on his face) What?
 Rachel: Oh. (puts her hand over his mouth)
 Rachel: Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father’s boat didn’t make that much noise when it hit rocks!
 Rachel: Well okay how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we didn’t know it had!’
 Rachel: Okay see now what I just heard blah-blah-blah blah-blah-blah-blah-blah blah-blah-blah blah blah.
 Rachel: Oh that is so...
 Rachel: Yknow if what I do is so lame then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?
 Rachel: It’s not dumb. But maybe it’s okay that you’re not a part of it. Yknow what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean it’s like I-I-I like that you’re not involved in that part of my life.
 Rachel: Honey see it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I do. I love you I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me yknow I’m out there on my own and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it because it’s mine. I but I mean is that okay?
 Rachel: What?!!
 Rachel: (answering her phone at work) Hello.
 Rachel: Oh hi.
 Rachel: Well there was a disaster in shipping and I’ve got to get this order in. Honey I’m so sorry but it looks like I’m gonna be here all night.
 Rachel: No-no-no no honey please I’ve got I’ve just have so much to deal with.
 Rachel: (on the phone) No no no I’m looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And....

 Rachel: (angrily) None for me.
 Rachel: I’m sorry as I was saying the store number is wrong and I’m sorry but that’s... (notices a fire that Ross’s candle has started) Oh my God!!
 Rachel: (on phone) Excuse me I’m sorry I’m gonna have to call you back I’ve got a Schemp in my office. (hangs up) (to Ross) What are you doing?
 Rachel: Ross you’re not listening to me I don’t have time to stop.

 Rachel: Look I cannot do this right now okay I’ve got a deadline would you just go home I’ll talk to you later. (storms out)
 Rachel: Good bye!
 Rachel: Hi. Look um about what happened earlier...
 Rachel: (throws her stuff down) I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
 Rachel: You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody’s work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
 Rachel: But I told you I didn’t have the time!
 Rachel: Wh Ross what do you want from me? You want me you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
 Rachel: Just a job!
 Rachel: Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...
 Rachel: Well neither do I!

 Rachel: Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again Ross no you’re you’re you’re making this too hard.
 Rachel: I don’t know I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look maybe we should take a break.

 Rachel: No! Really no please please that’s that’s okay.
 Rachel: Oh yeah I’m not I’m not hungry.
 Rachel: Oh. Okay bye.
 Rachel: Oh and then we got into this big stupid fight. I just it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger or something oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break I don’t want to take a break.
 Rachel: No. (grabs an eggroll) And then I called him and he wasn’t there.
 Rachel: Oh thank you that’s very helpful I’m glad you came over.

 Rachel: No. A break from us.
 Rachel: Then we had this big stupid fight and I said I wanted to take a break I don’t want to take a break.
 Rachel: Nobody.
 Rachel: Umm honey look he just came over to....
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Well we never actually got to dinner.
 Rachel: No we kinda broke up instead.
 Rachel: (looking up at the ceiling) God Monica it’s on the ceiling.
 Rachel: Yeah but it’s okay because when Ross left Mark came over.
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: No no-no it’s okay calm down. Mark and I talked and I realised how much I love your stupid brother and yeah we got our problems but I really want to make it work.
 Rachel: (on answering machine) Hi it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please Ross you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
 Rachel: Eh I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And I yknow I don’t want to get back together over a machine.
 Rachel: So I love you.
 Rachel: And yknow what I’m gonna I’m gonna go to bed now but ah on my way to work tomorrow morning I’m gonna stop by around 830.
 Rachel: Bye.

 Rachel: So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
 Rachel: I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!
 Rachel: Just get away from me!

 Rachel: Good different?
 Rachel: Whoa!! Whoa whoa wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? (Ross can’t answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there when I was in there?!
 Rachel: And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
 Rachel: We were on a break!
 Rachel: You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?
 Rachel: Well you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
 Rachel: God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
 Rachel: Oh that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again.
 Rachel: All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
 Rachel: You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me and been naked with me and made love to me?
 Rachel: You knew that our hot sweaty writhing bodies were....
 Rachel: I’m thinking I’m gonna order a pizza.
 Rachel: Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes I’d like to order a large pizza.
 Rachel: With ah extra anchovies.
 Rachel: Yeah and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
 Rachel: Well I should think so. You slept with someone.
 Rachel: That’s....
 Rachel: That is neither here nor there.
 Rachel: No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?
 Rachel: (softly) I think you should go.
 Rachel: (softly) I really think you need to go now.
 Rachel: Yeah what the hell did I know!
 Rachel: (crying) No. I can’t you’re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never ever hurt me ever. God and now I just can’t stop picturing with her I can’t (Ross stands up and backs away) it doesn’t matter what you say or what you do Ross. It’s just changed everything. Forever.
 Rachel: Then how come it is?
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Okay let me just get a cup of coffee.
 Rachel: Closer than here?
 Rachel: Wait I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee.

 Rachel: Hi! Uhh do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I’m asking you first right?!. I mean I’m playing by the rules.
 Rachel: Chandler! You’re smoking? What are you doing?!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: No. Thank you.
 Rachel: Well they never have any paper in there yknow. So my rule is ‘no tissue no tuschy.’ (Phoebe laughs and gets out.) Well if everybody’s going. (She gets out and starts to close the door.)
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: What no no no mine are deceptively small I mean I-I-I actually sometimes st-stuff my bra.
 Rachel: No I stuff outside the bra.

 Rachel: What what’s it what’s going on?
 Rachel: So you know how to fix it?
 Rachel: Great!
 Rachel: Yeah we are definitely on Route 27.
 Rachel: I don’t know I’m sorry I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
 Rachel: Ugh okay well somebody will come and save us.
 Rachel: No! No I am not getting in a car with Ross we will just have to live here!
 Rachel: No you guys I am not getting in a car with him you’ll have to think of something else.
 Rachel: (all excited) Op op car! Car!! (sees it’s Ross) Ugh!!!
 Rachel: What is he doing here?!
 Rachel: All right!! Fine! Fine.
 Rachel: Ask me what?
 Rachel: You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
 Rachel: Why would you even want to come Ross? You’re a horrible skier.
 Rachel: All right let’s go!
 Rachel: Oh I’m sorry were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
 Rachel: Yknow Ross why don’t you put that on your answering machine!
 Rachel: (to Monica) What?!
 Rachel: Really Joey?
 Rachel: No I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: Well I’m really sick of your smoking so I brought something that is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)
 Rachel: Come on it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since.
 Rachel: (to Ross) What’s your problem?
 Rachel: Ross I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
 Rachel: Oh right ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
 Rachel: Oh yknow what I didn’t want cinnamon on this.
 Rachel: Oh my God!! Great!
 Rachel: Well that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
 Rachel: (laughs) Well I mean are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning y’know what I mean. That wig all in disarray and boobs flung over the night stand yknow.
 Rachel: I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
 Rachel: Monica last Saturday night what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?
 Rachel: All right.
 Rachel: Hey how are those tapes working out for ya?
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: Hey Mon let’s give Pete a chance Come on he was funny he seems really nice and that check thing was adorable.
 Rachel: We use it!!
 Rachel: Oh my God Monica’s gonna go out with a millionaire.
 Rachel: Oh my God I can’t believe this is a real $20000 check oh this is just so exciting.
 Rachel: Oh yeah sure that too.
 Rachel: Oh my God! The millionaire’s here!
 Rachel: Hi!!
 Rachel: Just one drink?!
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: Hi! All right let’s go shoppin’!!
 Rachel: Oh okay.
 Rachel: Wow! Umm....
 Rachel: I know.
 Rachel: Well I told him I would think about it but I’m gonna tell him no.
 Rachel: I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming cute guy who’s asking me to go out with him which I’m allowed to do and I felt guilty. Yknow like I’d be cheating on Ross or something.
 Rachel: I don’t have any issues with my Father.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Yeah. Ahh here’s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)
 Rachel: Oh yknow it’s just like hats and a shirt and CD’s just sort of stuff that you’ve left here.
 Rachel: No. Ross it it just seems that yknow it’s time we-we yknow move on. I mean I mean don’t’ you think?
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Good.
 Rachel: Ross you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
 Rachel: Okay all right give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug.
 Rachel: You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
 Rachel: Oh you are a petty man. You are a petty petty....
 Rachel: Petty... (goes into her room)
 Rachel: Petty...
 Rachel: Small...
 Rachel: You are so just doing this out of spite.
 Rachel: Huh?
 Rachel: You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t even fit you anymore!
 Rachel: (imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!
 Rachel: Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing she can be like ‘Where’s number 27?!’
 Rachel: Yknow what?
 Rachel: I can’t do this.
 Rachel: Well oh Mark I’m doing this for the wrong reasons yknow? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry it’s not very fair to you.
 Rachel: Oh God. I’m sorry about this.
 Rachel: You sure?
 Rachel: (entering) Hey!
 Rachel: Oh great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair.
 Rachel: Oh well I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it out it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)
 Rachel: (She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take a deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)
 Rachel: Hey Sophie!
 Rachel: Thanks for lunch Chandler. Yknow you didn’t have to walk me all the way back up here.
 Rachel: Honey um honey you do realise that we don’t keep the women’s lingerie here in the office?
 Rachel: Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)
 Rachel: (introduces them) Joanna this is my friend Chandler Bing (to Chandler) Joanna.
 Rachel: Bye Chandler.
 Rachel: Oh nothing he’s just goofy like that I actually hardly notice it anymore.
 Rachel: No!! No! He’s not married or involved with anyone!
 Rachel: Well I’ll ask him for you if you want me too?
 Rachel: (entering) Hey!
 Rachel: I need to talk to you!
 Rachel: Oh sorry. I meant Chandler.
 Rachel: Okay my boss Joanna when you left she started asking questions about you...
 Rachel: (looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay what do think? Are you interested at all?
 Rachel: Oh thank you Chandler this is so great she’s gonna love me.
 Rachel: Wow!!
 Rachel: What’s this?
 Rachel: All right!
 Rachel: (to Chandler) O-o-o-okay how did it go? Tell me everything.
 Rachel: Hmm.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Oh I....
 Rachel: Oh I know...
 Rachel: Ohh gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?
 Rachel: You can’t just say ‘Nice to meet you good night?’
 Rachel: Well they always called.
 Rachel: No. Sorry.
 Rachel: Okay okay. Umm well ah maybe he maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
 Rachel: Well...
 Rachel: No. I...
 Rachel: (grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!
 Rachel: Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out she’s gone crazy!
 Rachel: Come on this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her!
 Rachel: Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.
 Rachel: I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And I don’t care how hard it is for you do not tell her that you will call her again!
 Rachel: That’s fine!
 Rachel: I know.
 Rachel: Sophie’s desk.
 Rachel: (whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
 Rachel: Chandler!!
 Rachel: Okay you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now. (She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)
 Rachel: So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
 Rachel: What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
 Rachel: And you’re still not attracted to him at all?
 Rachel: Yeah but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health teacher.
 Rachel: Oh I am my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.

 Rachel: Now that you’re on you’re own you’re free to look as stupid as you like.
 Rachel: Yeah come here!
 Rachel: Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
 Rachel: (she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle but has trouble opening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as Ross enters.)
 Rachel: (She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!
 Rachel: I’m fine I’m fine.
 Rachel: Yes I am!
 Rachel: Look I’m fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her toes) Look at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin with her hand and almost falls over.) Whoa-whoa!
 Rachel: No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It’s a very big deal there’s a lot of people there I have to meet.
 Rachel: Well I will go to the hospital tomorrow it’ll still be broken then.
 Rachel: But yknow I could use a hand getting ready.
 Rachel: Look either help me or go.
 Rachel: (with a hurt expression on her face) Okay but before you go could you help me first?
 Rachel: (She drops the brush) Yknow what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please help me with this too?
 Rachel: (taking the brush back) Okay. Let’s use this brush. (Hands him another one.)
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Careful. Light. Okay do you know how just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
 Rachel: Oh-ho!
 Rachel: Hey! That’s just poking me in the eye!
 Rachel: Okay just sweep it.

 Rachel: Since when since when do you think I don’t wear enough of this?
 Rachel: Blow it.

 Rachel: (interrupting) Whoa-ho.
 Rachel: I don’t know.
 Rachel: Oh making it worse!
 Rachel: Oh was it awful?
 Rachel: I wrote you a letter.
 Rachel: (handing him the letter) It’s just some things I’ve been thinking about. Some things about us and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
 Rachel: Well I’ll be waiting for you just come up when you’re done.
 Rachel: (coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up and quickly puts the letter back together pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Why didn’t you come up?
 Rachel: You just finished?
 Rachel: So umm does it?
 Rachel: Does it?
 Rachel: What are you talking about Ross you just said that you read it twice! Look yknow what either it does or it doesn’t and if you have to even think about it...
 Rachel: Are you sure?

 Rachel: How was the beach?
 Rachel: Ooh I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?
 Rachel: All right that’s it you guys! What happened out there?
 Rachel: Oh-hooo I missed you.
 Rachel: Ooh I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Yknow?
 Rachel: You have! Ross you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all “Once a cheater always a cheater.”
 Rachel: Ooh I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
 Rachel: Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!

 Rachel: And hey! Just so you know it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
 Rachel: Good! ‘Cause I’ve got a product report to read it’s like eight pages I hope I don’t fall asleep.
 Rachel: (sees Chip’s phone number) Wow! Look at that Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
 Rachel: (interrupting) I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.

 Rachel: Umm when were you gonna tell me that you’re going out with Chip Matthews?
 Rachel: Nooo! It’s not okay! I can’t believe you would want to after what he did to me!
 Rachel: Monica! I couldn’t find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
 Rachel: I mean why of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
 Rachel: Okay that doesn’t help me because we went to the same high school.
 Rachel: (shocked) They had to have that specially made?!
 Rachel: (stunned) Oh my God they told us that was for the mascot!
 Rachel: Oh you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her)
 Rachel: Yeah. Just if it’s possible could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
 Rachel: I believe it.
 Rachel: Yes I do.
 Rachel: Oh sure I am because you always have to be right.
 Rachel: Jurassic Park could happen.
 Rachel: (entering) You guys you’re never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! (She’s holding a flyer.) Look kinda familiar?
 Rachel: You guys there’s a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean you know what that means?!

 Rachel: What did you get her? (Joey opens up a rectangular black box and holds up a pen.)
 Rachel: Okay honey what he means by that is ...while this is a very nice gift maybe its just not something a boyfriend gives?
 Rachel: Any luck?
 Rachel: All right look. Why dont you just return the book let Joey give her the clock pen and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.

 Rachel: Yeah Phoebe you’re… awful!
 Rachel: I know I remember that!
 Rachel: Well Chandler you’re gonna have to tell him.
 Rachel: Because you do.
 Rachel: Phoebe his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: So are things with you and Joey any better?
 Rachel: Oh wow eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
 Rachel: You shouldn’t.
 Rachel: Well I’m gonna take a nap turkey makes me sleepy.
 Rachel: I know but all that work you’re doing to get it ready I just… (goes into her bedroom.)
 Rachel: (standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!
 Rachel: Honey maybe we should take you to a doctor.
 Rachel: Ooh so cute that I’m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
 Rachel: I know it’s sick.
 Rachel: Because it’s Richard’s son! It’s like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
 Rachel: Is he okay in there?
 Rachel: So now what exactly is the point of the box?
 Rachel: (worried) Why?
 Rachel: Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)
 Rachel: (coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
 Rachel: Huh well maybe it uh it changed.
 Rachel: Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
 Rachel: Credit.
 Rachel: Ooh I like those sunglasses.
 Rachel: (Swears in Italian it’s the same term used by Joey earlier and Joey nods his approval.)
 Rachel: Fancy soap? I thought we were savin’ that for the Pope!
 Rachel: (pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.
 Rachel: Ross can you pass me the yams?
 Rachel: Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
 Rachel: Okay fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)
 Rachel: Don’t say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross what’s in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the museum from the first time we… were together. Okay maybe I exchange gifts sometimes but I keep the things that matter!
 Rachel: Joey had reasons.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Oh he sees her!
 Rachel: Hey y’know at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day then my birthday then bang!—before you know it they’re lighting that damn tree again. Ohh I want somebody! (hearing this Gunther moves in) Y’know I want a man!! (Gunther leaves depressed) I mean it doesn’t even have to be a big relationship y’know just like a fling would be great.
 Rachel: Well believe me it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung.
 Rachel: Yeah! Wait a minute it’s been a long time that I’ve been single. How come you never offered this before?
 Rachel: Okay! No accountants. Oh and no one from like legal. I don’t like guys with boring jobs.
 Rachel: Hey honey! What’s the matter? (Monica shows her her hat.) Fine I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
 Rachel: Well wait a minute you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yell at them? Or fire them?
 Rachel: Pheebs that’s great!

 Rachel: Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
 Rachel: Well yknow possibly. (pause) You didn’t tell him that though? Right?
 Rachel: You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!
 Rachel: Oh between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh he’s so gonna get the wrong idea.
 Rachel: Chandler! Patrick just uh ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
 Rachel: You idiot!!
 Rachel: You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
 Rachel: Y’know you should never be allowed to talk to people!
 Rachel: Oh! See just I’m right back where I started! Aww this sucks! Being alone sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
 Rachel: Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)
 Rachel: What?! Chandler what is the matter with you?!
 Rachel: Hey y’know at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day then my birthday then bang!—before you know it they’re lighting that damn tree again. Ohh I want somebody!

 Rachel: But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
 Rachel: Well how can you be a tour guide don’t you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
 Rachel: Honey this really is an incredible thing to do for them but there are things to think about.
 Rachel: Wow! I don’t know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a…keeper.
 Rachel: Yeah honey maybe you can talk to somebody who’s had a baby. Like your mom?
 Rachel: You guys are really right…there aren’t you?
 Rachel: Oh Chandler that is so nice.
 Rachel: Why? Just because you’re not mature enough to understand something like that?!
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Yeah you should really.
 Rachel: Yeah when we’re in the audience he doesn’t talk to us but he does wave.
 Rachel: Yeah not girls anyway guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that.
 Rachel: Let me see that. (Monica shows her) Oh yeah.
 Rachel: Well y’know sometimes that helps. (She realises what that could’ve meant.)
 Rachel: Well if you go to Disneyland you don’t spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
 Rachel: Oo toes!! Well for some people. (Chandler eyes her and her toes.)
 Rachel: Oo I can’t watch this it’s like Sophie’s Choice.
 Rachel: Ooh it was only okay.
 Rachel: It depends on who asked.
 Rachel: Oh Mon sure.
 Rachel: Yes. (Pause) You’re not asking are you?
 Rachel: Yes! Totally!
 Rachel: What the hell is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Is that you? (Monica nods her head no and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.) Ohhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joey’s with Monica in trail.)
 Rachel: (angrily) BACK OFF!!! (She starts banging on their door.) Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up get up get up get up get up!!
 Rachel: What is that noise?
 Rachel: Well I’ve been up since six. Thanks to somebody’s dumb-ass rooster.
 Rachel: Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: I’m so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
 Rachel: How many guesses do you get?
 Rachel: No! There’s no orange juice in there! We win!!
 Rachel: Okay well we won that one.
 Rachel: Yeah and none of these stupid grocery questions real personal questions.
 Rachel: Fine! We’ll ask Phoebe.
 Rachel: I know! I know it’s such a huge life-altering thing.
 Rachel: Tails!
 Rachel: We’ll take Literature!!
 Rachel: Chandler gets it! It’s Chandler Bing!
 Rachel: (shouting) It’s All Relative!!
 Rachel: (shouting) I’m sorry!
 Rachel: Monica I don’t want to lose 200 dollars.
 Rachel: Monica?!
 Rachel: Okay so let’s play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!
 Rachel: Oooohh that’s interesting.
 Rachel: Throw in the duck too!
 Rachel: Well he gets the other one all riled up.
 Rachel: Monica betting the apartment I don’t know about this.
 Rachel: Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
 Rachel: All right let’s do it.
 Rachel: Okay. (They go into the living room.)
 Rachel: All right!
 Rachel: 14?
 Rachel: Space cowboy!
 Rachel: Oh gosh it has something to do with numbers.
 Rachel: He carries a briefcase.
 Rachel: Oh-oh-oh he’s a transponce—transpondster!
 Rachel: Oh my God.
 Rachel: (entering from Chandler’s bedroom I guess and sees the foosball table.) Oh my God! I can’t believe you guys are actually think you’re moving in here!
 Rachel: Well I-I-I’m not moving.
 Rachel: No it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
 Rachel: Noooo.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: I don’t care I’m not going anywhere.
 Rachel: No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl’s apartment! That is a boy’s apartment it’s dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It’s-it’s so pretty! And look and it’s-it’s purple! And I’m telling you you with the steady hand I am not moving and now I have got the steady hand. (She holds out her hand which is shaking uncontrollably.)
 Rachel: That’s right! You do what the hand says!
 Rachel: How did it go?
 Rachel: Y’know what you are mean boys who are just being mean!
 Rachel: That is not true. She did! She forced me!
 Rachel: Well it stupid unfair question!
 Rachel: Will you stop calling it your apartment!
 Rachel: No it’s not!
 Rachel: Oh I think I saw some in here.
 Rachel: I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut it’ll die.
 Rachel: Bloomingdale’s eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps)
 Rachel: No but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: (on the phone) Monica I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! (Pause) I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye call me when you get this message. (Hangs up as her boss Mr. Waltham walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham I ah really need to talk to you.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Hi I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
 Rachel: Oh I’m so sorry.
 Rachel: Well at least that’s a great suit.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: No-no that wasn’t me! (To Joshua) Well we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.
 Rachel: Oh-oh sorry it’s this way it’s this way. (Motions to the correct way.)
 Rachel: I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today and I got to dress him up all day!
 Rachel: Oh I wish he was a doll then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name I never realised it Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
 Rachel: Hi-e!!
 Rachel: Well it was just something Josh said about v-necks but you had to be there.
 Rachel: It’s Joshua.
 Rachel: Why? Honey what is the big deal?
 Rachel: Yeah that’s true.
 Rachel: Chandler what did she say?
 Rachel: Beefsteak Charlie’s?
 Rachel: Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joey’s.) Oh hey do you need help with that?
 Rachel: Ooh I just feel bad I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and Joey’s.)
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: So I was with Joshua for an hour today and he has not asked me out. It’s just so frustrating!
 Rachel: Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?
 Rachel: Hmm-mmm.
 Rachel: Yeah but I’ve never asked a guy out before.
 Rachel: No. Have you?
 Rachel: I don’t even know how I would go about it.
 Rachel: You know what I’m gonna do that I’m gonna call him up and I’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin’? (Calls him) Hi! Joshua? It’s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale’s. (Listens) Yeah umm I was wondering if you umm if you umm left your wallet at the store today? Well we found a wallet and we—(Listens) the license?

 Rachel: Really?! You think that will work?
 Rachel: Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) You know its funny basketball because I happen to have tickets too… (Tries again.) Umm who likes the Knicks—(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)
 Rachel: Oh! Well as a single woman who is available I think you look great!
 Rachel: Yep. Oh yeah look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how they would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah this looks great. (Pause) Umm so you like it?
 Rachel: Great.
 Rachel: Sure.
 Rachel: Yeah-eah-ha!
 Rachel: Oh well you don’t want to do that now?!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Basketball!
 Rachel: I uh I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re interested just as a thank you for this week.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not two tickets I have an extra ticket.
 Rachel: He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got the date I’m just not on it!
 Rachel: Wow! Monica!
 Rachel: Honey this is not your fault just because you guys had a fight it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello Rachel. Hi Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes I just wanted to see you again. Oh I’m glad. Rachel I’d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin’?
 Rachel: How does going to a strip club help him better?
 Rachel: Um-hmm. (Joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves Rachel staring at his ass.) There we go. There it is.
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Oh okay. Uhh well let’s see. (Grabs his hand.) You’re about—well uh this one is large. And this one—(Grabs the other hand.)
 Rachel: Yeah! Okay two larges coming right up!
 Rachel: Yes.
 Rachel: Sure. You got it. Great!
 Rachel: Me Fledermaus great. I really—(motions to Joshua.)
 Rachel: So? (She puts her hands in his totally forgetting about the gloves and hoping for something more intimate.)
 Rachel: Ohh! Right! Right sorry I’ll be right back!
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: No! Nothing!
 Rachel: Yeah! That would be great!
 Rachel: (shocked) Well I-I guess—I…
 Rachel: Yeah great you betcha!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh. Oh right.
 Rachel: Oh yay!
 Rachel: (entering) Hey!
 Rachel: Hey Monica!
 Rachel: Ohh it’s Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So… What are you gonna do?
 Rachel: No! Help me!
 Rachel: Phoebe?
 Rachel: Ugh!
 Rachel: Ohh gosh. You guys come on this is—I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y’know the Wouldn’t it be great if she was my wife Rachel. Ohh all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
 Rachel: Ohh! (Realises that Ross is in the room.) Hi!
 Rachel: So….
 Rachel: Ohhhh come on!!!
 Rachel: No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross please!
 Rachel: I’ll be right there! (to Ross) Okay Ross please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we’ve gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
 Rachel: Oh thank you! Thank you thank you thank you! (Monica opens the door.) Emily?
 Rachel: I’m Rachel Green.
 Rachel: There’s been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I’m not free tonight. So…
 Rachel: Oh well no I…
 Rachel: I’ll get her.
 Rachel: Hey—whoa slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No keep moving. (Joey runs off.) Wow!
 Rachel: Well I didn’t see Joshua last night but I did punch a girl in the face.
 Rachel: The whole night was horrible it was pouring down rain and when I got there there was no Rachel Green on the list but there was a Rachel Greep.
 Rachel: No there is no Rachel Greep but then this other girl overheard us and she was all I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep! and he let her right in.
 Rachel: No she was already in but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
 Rachel: Honey that’s you’re name.
 Rachel: What? Who the hell is Emily—(realises) noooo!!
 Rachel: They’re in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her arms franticly and hits Chandler.)
 Rachel: How—how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hits Chandler again.)
 Rachel: I don’t get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler yet again.)
 Rachel: I don’t care! All right y’know what I’m just upset that I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
 Rachel: Oh y’know would you just for once not remember every…little…thing!! (Storms out.)
 Rachel: (joining them) Well I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t call. I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh you know what makes it so much worse Ross is all happy in Vermont!
 Rachel: (entering) I can’t believe it! He still hasn’t called.
 Rachel: It’s Joshua.
 Rachel: No I don’t.
 Rachel: Yeah come on! What’s going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)
 Rachel: See I don’t know for me it would have to Chantal.
 Rachel: Oh my goodness she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…
 Rachel: Well are we all together? Like in a group?
 Rachel: Oh hey!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh hmm.
 Rachel: Joshua.
 Rachel: Yeah I…
 Rachel: Oh thank goodness!
 Rachel: Oh no problem. I’m so glad I could help. Happy for you. (She playfully punches him.)
 Rachel: No happy for you! (Hits him harder.)
 Rachel: No-no-no that’ not Joshua.
 Rachel: Chandler there’s a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)
 Rachel: Chandler don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a guy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) That does! (Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
 Rachel: Hmm.
 Rachel: Well here’s another question for ya. Uhh do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
 Rachel: Okay good. Now that since you know when you come over would you mind actually using it?
 Rachel: Guess who we ran into today?!
 Rachel: You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
 Rachel: (entering with Joey) Hey!
 Rachel: Y’know you-you also could’ve used uh lamps and then followed the light.
 Rachel: It’s coming from Joey!
 Rachel: Please Ross you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
 Rachel: (starts laughing Ross stares at her) I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You’re right you are a tough guy. You’re the toughest palaeontologist I know.
 Rachel: Oh well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him.
 Rachel: You…are…not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today and guess what happened?
 Rachel: No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
 Rachel: (refers to the table) What are these?
 Rachel: Okay okay okay should I be scared?
 Rachel: Wow! If only more people knew.
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: (noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that weren’t there originally.) What-what are-what are these?
 Rachel: Oh my God! Look at this!
 Rachel: I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!
 Rachel: And did you?!
 Rachel: Oh my God.
 Rachel: Hello Mrs. Chatracus.
 Rachel: Thank God.
 Rachel: Well Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
 Rachel: Oh here’s that trench-coat that you wanted.
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: (stopping him) Oh no-no no-no they don’t want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
 Rachel: Well that’s because of a lot of…(She imitates someone picking their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)
 Rachel: I know!
 Rachel: Oh?
 Rachel: Well congratulations so do you love her?
 Rachel: Huh. Well uh that’s uh that’s interesting. (She goes over and retrieves her note.)
 Rachel: Oh it’s just an anti-theft device.
 Rachel: You need that you need that too ‘cause obviously a thief could just tear this up. (Rips up the note.)
 Rachel: Oops sorry. Listen we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually we have to have one in five minutes so everybody cancel your plans.
 Rachel: We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look he said he’s not ready to date so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)
 Rachel: Surprise!!!
 Rachel: Well it was all Ross’s idea.
 Rachel: Uhh because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh quick he’s looking over here say something funny.
 Rachel: Okay y’know what y’know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She does a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!
 Rachel: Care for a cherry?
 Rachel: No? Y’know I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
 Rachel: Oh could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
 Rachel: Up!
 Rachel: Yeah I did. I needed my lucky dress.
 Rachel: Ohh God! Look at him he’s so cute. I wanna go over there grab him and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: It’s not Christmas!
 Rachel: He’s not 11!
 Rachel: What? You’re leaving?!
 Rachel: No! You guys can’t leave yet! You have to stay we-we got the whole big thing planned!
 Rachel: (spinning the bottle) So Spin the Bottle works like this I spin the bottle it lands on Gunther so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther’s face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?
 Rachel: Yay! Emily!
 Rachel: Okay my turn!!
 Rachel: It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once it’ll kick again!
 Rachel: All right well everybody just remember where they were sitting.
 Rachel: Just a bug.
 Rachel: No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn’t working out to well for me but for four years this baby never missed.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Ohh yeah well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an ‘E!’
 Rachel: Gimme an ‘M!’
 Rachel: Gimme an ‘I!’
 Rachel: Gimme an ‘L!’
 Rachel: Gimme a ‘Y!’
 Rachel: What do you get? (She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) Emil—Whoa!! (She falls in Chandler’s room.) Okay! So that’s me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Gunther’s the only one that claps.)
 Rachel: I’m fine! I’m fine! I’m just losing a tooth it’s no big deal. I have a dentist! Y’know. I’m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. (She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do now?
 Rachel: All right come on let’s go get your coat.
 Rachel: Oh yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Y’know this bra… Really bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Y’know this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here a lot of memories. If these walls could talk y’know what they’d say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently pulling on her bra in order to remove it but it isn’t co-operating.)
 Rachel: Oh no-no-no! No I got this all under control.
 Rachel: Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is this is not how this is supposed to happen.
 Rachel: Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that if I could get you here I could seduce you.
 Rachel: Well I’m sorry I thought you needed them!
 Rachel: Why?!
 Rachel: You like me?
 Rachel: Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God I can’t believe this all this time I liked you and you liked me!
 Rachel: Oh no-no-no don’t say but! No-no but’s never good! Let’s just leave it at you like me and I like you.
 Rachel: Oh now see that’s a fancy but.
 Rachel: But….
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Ohh here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so you and Emily are free to go.
 Rachel: Oh Ross I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
 Rachel: Well if it makes you feel any better I made a fool out of myself.
 Rachel: Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
 Rachel: I’m so sorry.
 Rachel: Well maybe you didn’t want it to end?
 Rachel: You seem to really like her.
 Rachel: Ross that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends asking to hear stories about you looking through Monica’s photo albums I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.
 Rachel: Yeah you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: I don’t know it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: You’re a pathetic loser right?
 Rachel: Sit!
 Rachel: Oh my gosh Joshua!
 Rachel: They’re not true?
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Oh! Oh I love that but.
 Rachel: You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
 Rachel: Okay. (Joshua goes inside and to Chandler.) Every time.
 Rachel: All right y’know what come on do we really have to watch this while we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)
 Rachel: Honey what are you doing? That’s too heavy.
 Rachel: Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh God. (And gives it to Monica right away.)
 Rachel: Is that the heartbeat?
 Rachel: Oh wow! This is so cool.
 Rachel: Well so are-are you sure that there are three?!
 Rachel: What’s that song? It has been in my head all day long.
 Rachel: Y’know who doesn’t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
 Rachel: No he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
 Rachel: Yes!
 Rachel: I’m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. (As she exits Phoebe enters.) Hey Pheebs!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Well so why don’t you just turn it off?
 Rachel: Well what-what ‘cha got there?
 Rachel: Honey you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Well we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised…
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: (interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!
 Rachel: Well well I can up with it!
 Rachel: Well I…
 Rachel: Okay it’s not Relaxi Cab. It’s Relaxicab like taxicab.
 Rachel: Hey Mon if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight which one of these would you want to be wearing. (She’s holding two frilly lace nighties.)
 Rachel: Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal.
 Rachel: What am I making him by the way?
 Rachel: I thought I was making him filet mignon?
 Rachel: Wow I really get crabby when I cook.
 Rachel: Ohh please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So dig in!
 Rachel: (taking a bite) Hmmm!
 Rachel: Oh I know my God this is so—this rice is so—I am so good.
 Rachel: (sees the chick and the duck) Oh yeah I’m sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
 Rachel: Yeah sure okay. Okay.
 Rachel: All gone! So farm birds huh?
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Okay. So can I serve you a little of—What? What? What? (She sees that Joshua isn’t relaxed.)
 Rachel: But they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
 Rachel: Okay y’know would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.
 Rachel: Your parents’?
 Rachel: Ohh.
 Rachel: Yeah that works.
 Rachel: Wow! This place is fabulous!
 Rachel: Whoa-whoa there’s two living rooms? God growing up here this place must’ve been a real babe magnet.
 Rachel: Ohh you should know this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
 Rachel: That sounds like a plan. Umm is there a place I can go freshen up?
 Rachel: Ah.
 Rachel: Hi you!
 Rachel: I know I can do more than cook.
 Rachel: Ohh! It’s so nice to meet you. (She goes over and shakes their hands.) Hello.
 Rachel: Hello.
 Rachel: What? This-this no oh no no-no-no this is not—that’s-that’s not what it is. See see okay I work in fashion see and-and this is a real dress actually. It’s-it’s they’re-they’re wearing it in Milan so part of my job is too wear the clothes and then I see how people respond and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale’s so… And obviously in uh in-in this case (She grabs a pen and paper) I am going to report back USA not ready.
 Rachel: Yes!
 Rachel: Well we were going to do that after—I mean umm next.
 Rachel: Oh yeah well… Yeah no use wasting this baby just lyin’ around the house.
 Rachel: Yes.
 Rachel: Oh yeah. And uh the best part though when the uh waiter spilled water down my back I jumped up and my boob popped out.
 Rachel: No it’s all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod there heads in agreement.)
 Rachel: So?
 Rachel: Huh.
 Rachel: She’s totally right! When we were together you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
 Rachel: Absolutely! Absolutely!
 Rachel: What—yeah—what y’know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
 Rachel: HEY!! Do you have to do that? It’s Saturday!
 Rachel: I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
 Rachel: Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
 Rachel: Monica you don’t even have a bed you sleep in a ball on the floor!
 Rachel: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
 Rachel: (entering) Hey!
 Rachel: So—Hey Pheebs! So how are the elves?
 Rachel: Yeah my mom got my dad’s season tickets in the divorce so she just gave them to me.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Do you guys want these?
 Rachel: Ohh well you got ‘em.
 Rachel: Just give us our apartment back!
 Rachel: Oh come on! We know what these are worth.
 Rachel: You’re bachelor pad?!
 Rachel: Or I’ll give them to my new boyfriend Joshua.
 Rachel: All right okay look what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
 Rachel: Let me finish.
 Rachel: I’m talking about a bet winner takes all.
 Rachel: Oh okay well I think we should let Phoebe decide because she’s the only who’s impartial and she’s so pretty.
 Rachel: What? Shut up! We’re winning!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: All right cut let’s pick again pick again.
 Rachel: Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queen is high!
 Rachel: We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)
 Rachel: All right. We figured you might respond this way so we have a backup offer.
 Rachel: Let us keep the apartment and…
 Rachel: Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Yeah I-I heard. (Pause everyone looks at each other waiting for Rachel’s reaction.) I think it’s great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh I’m so happy for you!
 Rachel: Hey Mon I was just doing the dishes!
 Rachel: Oh! It’s you. (She stops doing the dishes.) Hi.
 Rachel: Yeah yeah I was just about to take a break anyways so…
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Yeah. Yeah. Definitely well it definitely took me by surprise but I’m okay.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Oh that’s sweet.
 Rachel: (breaking the hug) Uhh hang in there?
 Rachel: I mean maybe you didn’t hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
 Rachel: Oh no-no-no no-no-no it has become it has—yeah. Oh no those were four great dates.
 Rachel: Yeah. Oh yeah. And I mean the connection I mean y’know emotionally mentally physically…
 Rachel: I know isn’t it? It’s like I’m right there with Joshua.
 Rachel: You are right there with Emily. And it’s y’know it’s kinda like…. it’s a tie! Well I gotta get I gotta get back to the dishes.
 Rachel: Oh yeah? Fine.
 Rachel: Oh yeah no what’s that?
 Rachel: That would be great!
 Rachel: (to the closed door) Hang in there. You hang in there. (Gives him the raspberry.)
 Rachel: No just singing. (Does a little song.)
 Rachel: (entering) Hi!
 Rachel: Handling it? What do you mean handling it? There’s nothing to handle. Now maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua. Y’know they’re not gonna get married anyway!
 Rachel: Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous! I mean they’re gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off. I’m telling ya you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re dancing at there’s.
 Rachel: Why not?
 Rachel: Nothing.
 Rachel: In a month?
 Rachel: You mean you mean 30 days?
 Rachel: From now?
 Rachel: Well that’s great.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Ohh nothing I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. (Hugs him) See you.
 Rachel: Yeah! (She sits down) Sit!
 Rachel: I’m more than okay I am really really happy! Wanna know why?
 Rachel: ‘Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are I think we are so on the right track! Y’know? I mean I think we are working I think we are clicking. Y’know?
 Rachel: Yeah-yeah y’know if-if there was just like one little area where I—that I think we need—we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we’re just not crazy enough!
 Rachel: Well yeah right y’know what? Yeah you’re right I mean we no we have our fun. Yeah! But if (Grunts uncomprehensively)……I mean I mean like craaaazy! Y’know? Okay all right. This is gonna this is gonna sound y’know a little umm hasty but uh just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
 Rachel: Oh I know I know it’s-it’s so it’s so totally like Whoa! Can we do this? Y’know I mean but I mean it just feels right! Don’t you think? It does! I mean it just feels right don’t you think?
 Rachel: (entering from her bedroom) Well I just called Joshua…
 Rachel: Well I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.
 Rachel: Well uh his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
 Rachel: Yeah maybe but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married but as it turns out I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.
 Rachel: And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
 Rachel: Well yeah y’know how Ross and I were on again off again on again off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road we would be on again.
 Rachel: Yeah well you uh better make it for three.
 Rachel: Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there.
 Rachel: Uh well I think I think he broke up with me.
 Rachel: Well apparently he scares easy.
 Rachel: It’s okay. Sometimes things don’t work out the way you’d thought they would.
 Rachel: (breaking the hug) Oh hey don’t you have to go pick up Emily?
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Yeah! I got my girls.
 Rachel: Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebe’s lap.)
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Y’know I gotta tell ya this really does put in a better mood.
 Rachel: Oh okay! (She goes to answer the door.)
 Rachel: I’m not gonna marry Chandler!
 Rachel: Okay you guys just relax. (She goes over to open the door and as she does she says.) I doooo. (Sees that it’s Joshua not Chandler that knocked on the door.)
 Rachel: Oh wait Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah well that oughta do it.
 Rachel: Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you werent there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are you are!
 Rachel: Hi sure!
 Rachel: I knew.
 Rachel: I did.
 Rachel: Yeah maybe...
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Oh Ross youre so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Ohhh!!!! [looking at something behind Ross]
 Rachel: Oh look at the little cat! [a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross] Look at it!
 Rachel: All right listen missy. If you want this cart youre gonna have to take me with it!
 Rachel: (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?
 Rachel: I could not have done this without you.
 Rachel: (hurt) What?
 Rachel: Hey I was doin great before I found out about you. You think its easy for me to see you with Julie?
 Rachel: Alright fine you go ahead and you do that alright Ross.
 Rachel: Cause I dont need your stupid ship.
 Rachel: Good. (Ross leaves)
 Rachel: Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...
 Rachel: Well neither do I!
 Rachel: (shocked) Oh my God.
 Rachel: Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again Ross no you’re you’re you’re making this too hard.
 Rachel: I don’t know I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look maybe we should take a break.
 Rachel: No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.
 Rachel: Hi. Ohhh you got my message.
 Rachel: So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
 Rachel: (opening the door) Yknow what I want you to leave! Get outta here!
 Rachel: Just get out! Now!!
 Rachel: Okay! All right! How was she?
 Rachel: Was she good?
 Rachel: Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it let’s talk about it!! How was she?
 Rachel: Good different?
 Rachel:  ...the way you owned up to everything it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Yknow?  I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all “Once a cheater always a cheater.”  Ooh I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
 Rachel: You seem to really like her.
 Rachel: Ross that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends asking to hear stories about you looking through Monica’s photo albums I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.
 Rachel: Yeah you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: (entering) Hey guys! What’s up?
 Rachel: What’s this? Is this Ross’s wedding invitation?
 Rachel: Oh no! No you guys! Come on you don’t have to do that! I’m happy for him! I am! I really—I’m-I’m happ—I’ll work on it.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Oh honey I don’t know. I…
 Rachel: No I’ll think about it. Yeah.
 Rachel: Whos this from?
 Rachel: Oh... (opens it and sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.
 Rachel: It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store and I saw this pin in the window and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I cant believe he remembered!
 Rachel: What did you just say?
 Rachel: Oh.... my God.
 Rachel:  (seeing Ross come off the plane with another woman.) Oh my God.
 Rachel: Julie! Julie isnt that great? I mean isnt that just kick- you-in-the-crotch spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
 Rachel:  She didnt hang up either...
 Rachel: (on phone) Ross hi its Rachel. Im just calling to say that um everythings fine and Im really happy for you and your cat...(cut)...I am over you. I am over you and that my friend is what they call closure. (She hangs up and tosses phone in the ice bucket.)
 Rachel: Oh my God. Oh my God Ross no hang up the phone give me the phone Ross give me the phone give me the phone give me the. . . (She jumps the couch and lands on Rosss back finally getting the phone from him. Ross has a confused expression on his face.)
 Rachel: Ohhhhhhhh God. (climbs off his back)
 Rachel: Ohh ohh.
 Rachel: Well basically lately Ive uh Ive uh sort of had feelings for you.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Oh god.
 Rachel: Oh its OK. You were worth the wait and I dont just mean tonight.
 Rachel: Ah oh God. Oh honey oh thats OK.
 Rachel: Yeah because I was mad at you not because I stopped loving you!
 Rachel: Noo.
 Rachel: Noo! Maybe! I I don’t know.
 Rachel: I just I feel I-I just...
 Rachel: Yknow I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
 Rachel: And hey! Just so you know it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
 Rachel: Oh my God.
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: I cant go to my own prom without a date I cant its too late.
 Rachel: Yeah. It’s just gonna be too hard. Y’know? I mean it’s Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y’know it’s just it’s for the best y’know it is it’s… Y’know plus somebody’s got to stay here with Phoebe! Y’know she’s gonna be pretty big by then and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
 Rachel: I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah see there’s so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
 Rachel: So uh Pheebs honey how are those mood swings coming?
 Rachel: Whoa! Hey-hey you planning on inviting us?
 Rachel: Hormones!
 Rachel: Nooo!
 Rachel: All right fine! You’re not invited to the party we’re gonna have either.
 Rachel: Well umm…
 Rachel: Little village people.
 Rachel: Oh that is so sweet!
 Rachel: Huh. Except Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
 Rachel: Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
 Rachel: Oh and somebody can get those leather pants she’s always wanted!
 Rachel: Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebe’s way.)
 Rachel: No we…
 Rachel: …hormones yeah.
 Rachel: Oh well actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross’s wedding.
 Rachel: It just might be too hard given the history and all that…
 Rachel: Well h-how is this like that?
 Rachel: (starting to cry) I’m-I’m sorry I just thought that…
 Rachel: Good.
 Rachel: What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)
 Rachel: You what?

 Rachel: Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!
 Rachel: I don’t know!
 Rachel: I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour.
 Rachel: Well isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
 Rachel: No really. Really Pheebs you’re not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college or yelling at them when they’re bad y’know or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down. Y’know?
 Rachel: And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
 Rachel: And y’know what else oh my God are they gonna love you.
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Who are you saying check too?
 Rachel: Have fun!
 Rachel: Oh I know.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Yeah well I gotta work I’m sorry.
 Rachel: Because I can’t! Ross I told you no. I can’t.
 Rachel: Oh honey! Don’t get up! What do you need?
 Rachel: Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
 Rachel: Okay that is all you.
 Rachel: Oh I don’t know. I guess we have to eat.
 Rachel: I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
 Rachel: (interrupting) Still in love with?!
 Rachel: I’m not in love with Ross!
 Rachel: Phoebe I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because I’m still in love with him! I mean hey y’know I like Ross as much as the next guy y’know? Clearly I have feelings for him but feelings don’t mean love! I mean I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But I have I have continuing feelings of love but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him. Y’know? I-I have sexual feelings for him but I do love him—Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my—why didn’t you tell me?!!
 Rachel: We?!
 Rachel: You all know? Does Ross know?
 Rachel: Oh I can not believe you didn’t tell me!
 Rachel: (depressed) Hi.
 Rachel: Manhattan does not have enough stores.
 Rachel: You can?
 Rachel: Um-hmm.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Ooh is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
 Rachel: I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
 Rachel: I don’t know his uh his hair never really bothered me that much and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: All right.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Ow!
 Rachel: Well I like you less!
 Rachel: Pheebs?
 Rachel: Do you remember where the duck food is?
 Rachel: (enters with a bag packed) Because I’m going to London.
 Rachel: Yeah I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey you take care you don’t have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.)
 Rachel: Yeah I know I know I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
 Rachel: Ohh—Do you think he will?!
 Rachel: Y’know what? No. It’s not over until someone says I do. (Exits)
 Rachel: (Running to the ticket counter) Ooh ooh oohoohooh. (Slightly out of breath) Hi.
 Rachel: (Faking cheerfulness.) Hello. Umm when is your next flight to London?
 Rachel: Ohh good.
 Rachel: Ohh thank you thank you thank you.

 Rachel: Hello. I need to get on the 11 oclock flight.
 Rachel: Okay you know what/ You’re going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.
 Rachel: Sure you know what? Come on we’ll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the engine.
 Rachel: Look If I don’t get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!
 Rachel: All right you know what? I am not leaving here until you call that plane back!! (She pounds her hand on the counter twice. The ticket agent counters by placing the closed sign on the counter and tapping it twice.)
 Rachel: Ohhh.(she rhythmically taps her hands on the magazine on her lap.)
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Oh. I’m sorry. I’m very sorry. Sorry. (She hums and sighs happily.) It’s just I’m ahh I’m kinda excited. I’m ahh going to London to ahh tell this guy that I love him and... (He puts his headphones on to ignore her.)
 Rachel: ...And so then I realized. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua lying to Ross about why I couldn’t come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...
 Rachel: Ehh pardon me?
 Rachel: But he has to know how I feel!
 Rachel: (Sighing) Well I-I think your wrong.
 Rachel: Well I just came...(She touches him near his heart. She’s almost in tears.) I just needed to tell you...(Looking into his eyes. She takes a deep breath.) Congratulations. (He hugs her. She can barely hold back the tears.)
 Rachel: (To the woman sitting in front of her) He-he said Rachel right? Do you think I should go up there?
 Rachel: Mon honey I gotta ask you something.
 Rachel: Ross said my name up there I mean come on I just can’t pretend that didn’t happen can I?
 Rachel: Monica what should I do?

 Rachel: Oh hi!
 Rachel: Hi. Sorry things aren’t working out so well.
 Rachel: Oh yeah! Of course I mean she’s gonna get over this y’know? I mean so you said my name! Y’know you just said it ‘cause you saw me there if you’d have seen a circus freak you would’ve said I take thee circus freak. Y’know it didn’t mean anything it’s just a mistake. It didn’t mean anything. Right?
 Rachel: Right…
 Rachel: (laughs) Y’know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
 Rachel: Get the hell out of there y’know?
 Rachel: Well look at that same thing.
 Rachel: Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! (They both just stare at her.) Okay don’t believe me I know I’m right—do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Hello? Oh Pheebs! (To them) It’s Phoebe!
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Well Ross said my name.
 Rachel: Okay Pheebs y’know what let’s look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time his obsession begins to grow. So then…

 Rachel: Well of course I am! Its not gonna happen to Ross! Hes your brother. (To Chandler) Hes your old college roommate. Ugh it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
 Rachel: Honey come on! You live far away! Youre not related. You lift right out.

 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Please! We did not fog Danny! Whos Danny?
 Rachel: Hi! You might not remember us but we are the girls that fogged you.
 Rachel: Hi! Just so you know we-we didnt mean to fog you we thought you were like a yeti or something.
 Rachel: Hi! Sorry to bother you but I dont think we can accept your acceptance of our apology it just doesnt really seem like you mean it.
 Rachel: Really! What is with that guy? I mean youd forgive me if I fogged you.
 Rachel: Oh my God honey Im so sorry!
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Oh my God! Oh my God look at these pelts!
 Rachel: What? Uhh Phoebe honey honey I know youre quirky and I get a big kick out of it we all do actually but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature fashion!

 Rachel: Well yknow if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
 Rachel: And stop saying that! I hate that!
 Rachel: Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You cant even open up your mind for a second to see if youre wrong! What does that say about you?
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Okay. Okay.
 Rachel: (entering) Hi!
 Rachel: Oh I went to have pizza. With Danny.
 Rachel: That yeti is one smooth talker.
 Rachel: Yeah yknow I-I think Im just gonna hang out in my room.

 Rachel: Okay oh heres what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
 Rachel: Well like anything can be sexy. Like umm oh-oh like this dishtowel! (She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) Ooh ooh this feels sooo good against my cheek!

 Rachel: Oh-oh-oh symbolism! And uh the-the uh wildness of the mores which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliffs character.
 Rachel: Well honey that was pretty obvious.
 Rachel: Be-because I didnt want him to think I was stupid! I mean that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
 Rachel: Joey is what she just said umm—Oh my God. (Looks around the room.) You were actually gonna… (Chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.) (Rachel stares in shock.)

 Rachel: Okay but if it only happened that one time how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
 Rachel: And the video camera?
 Rachel: Oh my god. Ok you guys there’s Danny. Watch. Just watch this. (He walks past the couch to the counter.) See?! Still pretending he’s not interested. Ohh he’s coming over. Just pretend like we don’t know him. We’ve forgotten who he is.
 Rachel: Thanks Mon.
 Rachel: Monica!!!
 Rachel: (Somewhat angrily) Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don’t answer me. (Giggling) I have a date with Danny.
 Rachel: I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.

 Rachel: No but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
 Rachel: She was kinda stupid. Youre right. All right Im just gonna go on the date. Im gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.

 Rachel: Oh good point.
 Rachel: (To Joey) Happy New Year Joey!
 Rachel: But your divorce isnt even final yet.
 Rachel: Op look! Claire forgot her glasses! And shes gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend who I hear needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer if you know what Im talking about.
 Rachel: I dont gossip!
 Rachel: Well maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on yknow kinda like a public service it doesnt mean Im a gossip. I mean would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
 Rachel: What? They were like this!
 Rachel: I didn’t! Even when I found out…umm all right well lets just say I found something out something about someone and lets just say shes gonna keep it. (Goes into her room.)
 Rachel: I think theyre very nice.
 Rachel: Awful absolutely awful. (Plus other negative comments from Phoebe and Monica.)
 Rachel: (entering singing) Baddest man in the whole damn town.
 Rachel: Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)
 Rachel: (entering) Joey do you have a minute?
 Rachel: Oh Joey I have such a problem!
 Rachel: Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey I have got to tell you something!
 Rachel: Oh my God its so huge but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
 Rachel: Yes! Yes! Yes you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
 Rachel: What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
 Rachel: I know I know! I just cant keep this one in so I pick up the phone… (Joey in a childish attempt to not hear what Rachel is about to say puts his fingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. Rachel turns and walks out upon seeing that Joeys not gonna listen and as she exits Chandler walks in and sees Joey in his current state.)
 Rachel: That really is something; thats really cool.
 Rachel: Good luck honey!
 Rachel: Hey uh Joey?
 Rachel: Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
 Rachel: Im not gonna tell you but if you found out on your own that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
 Rachel: (quietly) Yeah. Well. (Pause.) Hey uh Joe would mind going over to Chandlers bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Do you know something?
 Rachel: I might know something too.
 Rachel: Oh no I cant tell you until you tell me what you know.
 Rachel: Well then I cant tell you what I know.
 Rachel: All right how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandlers bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know! (Note Kudos to Ms. Aniston on the delivery of that line. She said it very quickly and didnt screw up a word. Try it yourself it aint that easy.)
 Rachel: AND YOU KNOW!!!
 Rachel: Chandler and Monica?!! Oh this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
 Rachel: Ohhh yeah me too.
 Rachel: Come on Joey!!!
 Rachel: I cant believe you would say that!
 Rachel: No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! (She sits next to him on the couch.) Fine I want—I need more details who-who initiated the first kiss?
 Rachel: Is he romantic with her?
 Rachel: Are they in love?
 Rachel: You dont know anything.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Pheebs I don’t think anyones mad about that.
 Rachel: Oh umm yknow I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
 Rachel: (To Monica) Hey!
 Rachel: Whats up?!
 Rachel: Well yeah I do but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Yknow I-I feel that we dont talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?

 Rachel: Nothing! You go!
 Rachel: Wow thats uh juicy. Umm (checks watch) yknow what though Mon I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if—are you sure theres just not anything else?
 Rachel: No! (Gets up to leave.) (Under her breath.) If there was I wouldnt tell you.
 Rachel: Ross couldnt fit down the trash chute.
 Rachel: There he is!
 Rachel: Ohh out oh God I dont know why we didnt think to check there!
 Rachel: You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
 Rachel: Yeah! No thats what I was thinking.
 Rachel: Ross! Janice?!
 Rachel: (entering) Okay I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay you go!
 Rachel: Ugh Monica I know about you and Chandler.
 Rachel: I overheard you guys on the phone the other day and you said Ill just tell Rachel that Im doing laundry for a couple of hours. And he said Laundry? Is that my new nickname? And you said No! You know what your nickname is Mr. Big.
 Rachel: Well I wouldnt know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: All right. So youre telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
 Rachel: Sure! Why?
 Rachel: What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! Thats it! Yknow what? Im just gonna go over there and confront them right now!

 Rachel: Joey if you wanna look good why dont you just come down to the store? Ill help you out.
 Rachel: Sure! (Pause) God please take those off!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Well maybe maybe shes with us right now?
 Rachel: Okay now Joey yknow that since youre returning all of this stuff right after the audition youre gonna have to wear underwear?
 Rachel: Okay its missing something. Ooh I know! Umm okay. (Goes and grabs a bag that looks like a purse and shows it to Joey.)
 Rachel: Its not a purse! Its a shoulder bag.
 Rachel: No Joey look. Trust me all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look men carrying the bag.
 Rachel: Exactly! Unisex!
 Rachel: No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
 Rachel: (entering) Joey what are you doing with the bag? Youre audition is not until tomorrow.
 Rachel: Joey yknow you get any mustard on that bag you cant return it.
 Rachel: All right then you owe me $350.
 Rachel: (glaring at him) Joey…

 Rachel: What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
 Rachel: Honey wait Joey I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it… (Looks for help.)
 Rachel: …I just dont know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
 Rachel: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Im not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag I just—its just there are other bags that are a little less umm (Pause) controversial.
 Rachel: Id say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
 Rachel: Ohh Im gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
 Rachel: Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
 Rachel: Well I never thought Id say this but Im gonna go use Ugly Naked Guys bathroom. (Does so.)

 Rachel: OH MY GOD!!!
 Rachel: Phoebe!! Phoebe!! Its okay!! Its okay!!
 Rachel: I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!

 Rachel: Nothing! Oh God were just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
 Rachel: Uh-huh doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
 Rachel: Joey! Come here! Come here!
 Rachel: Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
 Rachel: No. Joey she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guys apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. (Joey gasps) Actually we saw them doing it up against the window.
 Rachel: Wh-what do you mean?
 Rachel: Ohhh I-I would enjoy that!
 Rachel: Ehhh no I wanna do Phoebes thing.
 Rachel: You dont have any secrets!
 Rachel: (To Phoebe) So umm how-how are we gonna mess with them?

 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
 Rachel: All right honey wed better go if we wanna catch that movie.
 Rachel: Oh Ross honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
 Rachel: Yknow what you should do?
 Rachel: You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm sandwiches. Or uh or my underwear.
 Rachel: (To Ross) See?
 Rachel: Yeah he broke those too.
 Rachel: Hello! (Listens) Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second shes right here! (To Phoebe) Its Chandler.
 Rachel: Are you kidding?!
 Rachel: I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey do they know that we know?
 Rachel: Joey!
 Rachel: Ugh I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
 Rachel: All right. Be sexy.
 Rachel: Oh yeah! (She gasps.) Oh my God! That is our friend! (Monica covers her face.) Its Naked Ross! (Monica turns and buries her face in Chandlers shoulder.)
 Rachel: Show time!
 Rachel: Okay! (She runs to get some.)
 Rachel: (handing her the wine) Okay honey now Im gonna try to listen from right here!
 Rachel: Okay? Whoa wait! (She undoes one button on Phoebes dress.)
 Rachel: Yeah oh wait! (She goes for another one.)
 Rachel: Joey look just look at it this way the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
 Rachel: Okay!
 Rachel: (running from the guys apartment with Joey in tow) Hey whats-whats going on?!
 Rachel: Awww no its okay weve actually known for a while.
 Rachel: Well Ross we were worried about you. We didnt know how you were going to react.
 Rachel: Oh! Oh I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
 Rachel: Aww Joey come here. (She takes his hand.) Look honey I know this must be really really difficult for you and I--Oh Im sorry. Am I hurting you?
 Rachel: Hmm. Look Ross if you want your neighbors to like you why dont you just pay the hundred bucks? The partys gonna cost you way more than that.
 Rachel: Okay I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
 Rachel: And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
 Rachel: Umm Chandler you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monicas head.
 Rachel: Well because she loves you and because you love her.
 Rachel: Hey Chandler dont freak out! Im telling you something you already know! Come on she broke up with Richard because he didnt want to have babies. And shes a woman and shes almost 30 and yknow its Monica.
 Rachel: No youre right you are absolutely right. I mean that makes that makes everything different.
 Rachel: Not unless different means the same.
 Rachel: Hi! Wow! You look you look…big.
 Rachel: Uhhh yeah. But its not obvious why.
 Rachel: Hey! Hey cute jacket!
 Rachel: Oh! Ow! (Joey motions You see what I mean?!)
 Rachel: Whoa! (Laughs) Yknow what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much. (She punches Katie back.)
 Rachel: Ohh and the nicest girlfriend! (She retaliates.)
 Rachel: Ohh youre so sweet! (She kicks Katie in the shin.)
 Rachel: Ohhhh I cannot look at it! (She doesnt move.)
 Rachel: Oh no wait Pheebs I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But Im not sure Chandler?
 Rachel: (looking at the bill) Uhh we still need a tip.
 Rachel: A couple of bucks.
 Rachel: Phoebe I bet somebodys missing that badge.
 Rachel: Hey Joey!
 Rachel: (disgusted at Rosss antics) Ugh!
 Rachel: What?! You say that to kids?!!
 Rachel: Ross honey its a nice couch. Its not a magic couch.
 Rachel: Wait! No thats ridiculous. Come on he lives three blocks away!
 Rachel: Yeah! (She puts on her coat and turns around and sees Ross is expecting her to help.) (Laughing.) Are you kiddin?
 Rachel: (Disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. Much to her amazement she is successful.) Oh. Oh! I can do it!
 Rachel: Ross!
 Rachel: Ross!
 Rachel: Come on I dont really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
 Rachel: (To Ross) Fine! (To the salesman) We went out.
 Rachel: Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
 Rachel: Ross didnt you say that there was an elevator in here?
 Rachel: Okay yknow what? There is no more left left!

 Rachel: I know.
 Rachel: Whats up Joe?
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: (laughing) What are you saying?
 Rachel: Yknow honey umm as uh as flattered as I am that uh you saw me first uhh I just I-I dont think we should be cranking anything up.
 Rachel: (laughs and pushes the chair back in) Yeah well yknow umm… No honey listen I think its a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them but I think the way you do it is yknow you meet someone become their friend build a foundation then you ask them out on a date. Dont hit on your existing friends!
 Rachel: Yeah. Yeah. Oh but once you find it ohh its so worth the wait.
 Rachel: (entering) Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
 Rachel: Well I brought the next best thing.
 Rachel: Whoa-oh whats-whats that? (Points.)
 Rachel: Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
 Rachel: Okay!
 Rachel: Ross I dont I just dont think its going to fit.
 Rachel: I know me neither! I mean you had a sketch!
 Rachel: Hey! Hows it going? Did you make any new friends?
 Rachel: What?! Why?!
 Rachel: Oh my God Phoebe are you gonna go to jail?!
 Rachel: Good you guys are all here!
 Rachel: Well I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
 Rachel: I know!
 Rachel: Wh-what?!
 Rachel: Anyway Im going to be the coordinator of the womans collection Ill work right under the director its the perfect perfect job for me!
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: O-okay!
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: Ugh horrible! I did the stupidest most embarrassing thing!
 Rachel: No!
 Rachel: Ugh it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well yknow? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like Well yeah! If youve got enough life jackets! (She starts laughing; Chandler and Joey are not amused.) Trust me it was actually it was very funny. Anyway so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
 Rachel: (We see a flashback as Rachel describes what happened.) All right we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me… Yknow maybe he was going to open the door but I totally miss read him and I uhhh… (The flashback shows that she kissed him on the cheek.)
 Rachel: Well I didnt know what else to do!
 Rachel: Thanks Chandler.
 Rachel: I cant believe it! I got a second interview!
 Rachel: What-what wait a minute you dont think thats why he wants me back?
 Rachel: I accidentally kissed him in the interview and now he wants me back yknow of course cause Lets bring the girl back who kisses everybody!
 Rachel: Oh my God! What if he thinks Im the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
 Rachel: Maybe. I-I dont know—Oh God how could I be so stupid?!
 Rachel: Ohh well Im not totally back yet but thank you.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Excuse me?
 Rachel: (stopping him) Wh-whoa! All right okay-okay I see I see whats going on here! Now listen look-look Im sorry if I gave you the wrong impression but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I (He tries to interrupt and tell her about the ink) hey-hey-hey even though I kissed you that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want this job that bad. Good day sir. (She storms out of his office.)
 Rachel: (entering) Ugh you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
 Rachel: Okay-okay that-thats amazing. How did you know that?
 Rachel: Oh. (Realizes.) Ohhhhhhhhh….
 Rachel: Ah first I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
 Rachel: (looks around for the camera) Okay. Umm well first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh for yelling at you.
 Rachel: Now youre probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah (She puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. Rachel then doesnt know where to put her hands.) who did who did not umm yell at you and storm out and I think thats a big mistake and heres why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job I said no. That shows integrity. And I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizes that she said courage twice.) Okay umm now I know I already said courage but yknow you gotta have courage. And umm and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  So she didnt want to sue him.   Dont worry I had to look it up too.} So there you go you got you got (counts them off with her fingers) courage you got integrity you got (Pause) courage again and not litigious. Look Mr…
 Rachel: Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really really want this job and I think I think I would be really good at it.
 Rachel: (gasps) Oh! You are?
 Rachel: Really? Oh thank you! Oh… Oh would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
 Rachel: Okay well then how about a handshake? (She goes to shake his hand but misses and touches his groin.) Oh God Im sorry! Oh God Im sorry! I did not mean to touch that—I mean you there. There. Uhh okay so thank-thank you Im going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh thank you so—Hey! Ill see you Monday! (Exits.)
 Rachel: (laughs) I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
 Rachel: Yeah! Oh by the way thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
 Rachel: (entering from her room) Okay gotta go! Wish me luck!
 Rachel: Uh well yknow what? I dont think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…
 Rachel: Okay guys way to wish me luck!

 Rachel: I mean what if this keeps happening? Yknow theyll-theyll be outside smoking making all the decisions and Ill just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air yknow?

 Rachel: Ross! We broke up two years ago; youve been married since then. I think its okay that we see other people.
 Rachel: Hm-mmm.
 Rachel: Okay yknow what? We dont need her measurements.
 Rachel: Big night!

 Rachel: Oh what you-you want both of them?
 Rachel: Okay okay okay look just dont freak out but I kinda lost it. I know its in the apartment but I definitely lost it.
 Rachel: Tell her to wear her own earrings.

 Rachel: Because I lose her stuff!
 Rachel: Oh boy I just cant watch. Its too scary!
 Rachel: Oh yeah well you know me babies responsibilities ahhh!!!
 Rachel: Uhh no no it bothered me when he slept with other women.
 Rachel: But yknow I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
 Rachel: Oh! Yknow what? Youre right! We meet you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
 Rachel: Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
 Rachel: Okay that is the one we already have!
 Rachel: (smiling) What?!

 Rachel: (smiling) Joey why dont you just tell her what happened? Its not your fault.
 Rachel: Its not here Pheebs its not here. Ohh I went to Joey and Chandlers last night! Okay! (Goes to the door.)
 Rachel: Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
 Rachel: (entering) (To Phoebe) (whispering) Hey!
 Rachel: The earring? No. But look I found my sunglasses under the couch! Ive been looking for these since like last summer. (Puts em on.)
 Rachel: Okay calm down here they are. (Gives back the sunglasses.)
 Rachel: I dont know I dont know.
 Rachel: Oh gosh shes going to kill me.
 Rachel: Ohh thatd be great!
 Rachel: Okay wait a minute. Wait a minute I-I-I I cant do this. Listen honey this is its not Phoebes fault. She lent me the earrings and I lost it. Im so sorry. Honey I feel terrible too. (Holds out her arms for a hug.)
 Rachel: Your sunglasses?!
 Rachel: Honey you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl I dont flirting is the right thing to… (Ross interrupts and shushes her.)
 Rachel: Im sorry.
 Rachel: Okay well Im gonna clear out some of these boxes. (She grabs a couple of the old pizza boxes and exits.)
 Rachel: Hey! Hey! (Stops Caitlin) Hi! Hey-hey-hey Im Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
 Rachel: No. No. Every things--theyre fine. Great pizza. But its uh actually umm my friend Ross. He uh just gets really nervous when hes flirting.

 Rachel: Yeah. Im-Im telling you hes really sweet and hes really funny and hes just ugh got a good heart. And besides I yknow I think he really likes you.
 Rachel: Well yknow we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas what do you think?
 Rachel: (entering) Hey Ross? Umm I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
 Rachel: Well I dont get it but she wanted me to give you her phone number. (Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: I-I-I didnt! I didnt! She thought you were cute.
 Rachel: Yay!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Ohh thank God! Finally!
 Rachel: Ohh its me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.

 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Ohh please dont be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! (She picks up the 2 pieces and looks at the stand.) Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh who would buy this?! (Looks for a place to hide it and finds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phone rings.)
 Rachel: Hey! Whats up?!
 Rachel: So all we have is ice?
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Oh. Oh! (Takes a slug of tequila.)
 Rachel: (does Monicas) I know!
 Rachel: What?! We cant do that!
 Rachel: Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!
 Rachel: I dont think hes the one who needs help.
 Rachel: Ugh!
 Rachel: Okay you are crazy! Im sorry but she sounded generally upset! I mean listen! (She hits a button on the machine.)
 Rachel: Noooooooo!
 Rachel: No wait. Wait.
 Rachel: No Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
 Rachel: Yeah well unless we tell him.
 Rachel: Oh maybe thats Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
 Rachel: Right?
 Rachel: Hey! Hi!
 Rachel: Hey! Yknow what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
 Rachel: Okay just a little scared. Whats going on Ross?
 Rachel: What?! What? What happened?!
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: (gasps) Really?!
 Rachel: Because a car backfired?
 Rachel: Well I-I-I dont know how this fits into your whole seizing thing but um Emily called you today.
 Rachel: No she left a message. (He starts for the machine.) (Stopping him.) But it-it kinda got erased. Theres just (Pause) something wrong with your machine.
 Rachel: Well uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh she wants you to call her.
 Rachel: Now that-that was a good thing that I told you right?
 Rachel: Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—Im sorry all right. Because yknow what? She didnt want me—not important. The point is I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. (She starts for the door.) (Stops) Your decision.
 Rachel: Okay no thats not the right decision. Thats not thats not right no Ross-Ross come on! I mean that woman made you miserable! Okay Ross do you really want to get back into that?
 Rachel: Ugh Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
 Rachel: Okay yknow what? Maybe this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
 Rachel: I mean look-look today you escaped (Pause) (Not believing it) death yknow? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
 Rachel: Well there you go!
 Rachel: (laughing) Close call day.
 Rachel: Ohh honey no problem. Okay. (Gets up.)
 Rachel: Oh?
 Rachel: No. (She heads for the door again.)
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: (going out the door) Yeah uh you-you probably need that for stamps right?
 Rachel: (entering) Hey you guys…
 Rachel: Is Monica here?
 Rachel: All right listen umm I just bought something Im not sure shes gonna like it and its gonna seem a little crazy but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
 Rachel: Noo! I wish! Okay you ready?
 Rachel: Okay! (She goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it Ross stares in shock.) Check it out!
 Rachel: Its a its a cat!
 Rachel: Yes it is!
 Rachel: Excuse me! But this is a purebred show-quality Sphinx cat!
 Rachel: Well it was a little extravagant but I a pretty good deal.
 Rachel: A thousand bucks.
 Rachel: All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute it would sit in my lap and purr all day long and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
 Rachel: Ugh! Look you guys Im really excited about this! Okay? I dont care what you think! Im gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. (They both glare at her.) Well what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Oh wow! Congratulations thats quite a waste of time.
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Well its my cat.
 Rachel: Oh yeah I got a cat.
 Rachel: You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmothers cat. I mean its not sweet its not cute I even dragged that little string on the ground and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear I know this sounds crazy but every time this cat hisses at me I know its saying Rachel!
 Rachel: Well I was gonna let you play with it.
 Rachel: (shes wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) I give up you guys I dont know what Im going to do with this thing!
 Rachel: I tried! They wont take her back.
 Rachel: Well they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean what am I going to do get a thousand regular cats?
 Rachel: No Mon thats not the point. Im out a thousand dollars Im all scratched up and Im stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (Storms out.)
 Rachel: Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! (A woman approaches.)
 Rachel: Its not a baby! Its a cat!
 Rachel: Oh no! No! Its actually—its very sweet. Its very sweet. Look! (Goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) Yeah do you want it?
 Rachel: Well so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
 Rachel: Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
 Rachel: Oh terrific! Thatll be $2000.
 Rachel: Okay a thousand.
 Rachel: Well I do but youre just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
 Rachel: (makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) Obviously you know how to haggle so Im not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I dont call the cops because youre robbing me blind! Blind! (Covers her eyes) Just take cat leave the money and run away! Run away! (Uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled) Damnit! (To the cat) Cat cant you at least smile or something?! (The cat hisses at her again it sounds like Rachel) Okay did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
 Rachel: Its not! Im defrosting a chicken. (Pause) Oh I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
 Rachel: Yeah 15 hundred dollars.
 Rachel: Oh yeah there you go. (Hands over the pillow.)
 Rachel: Oh good great! Ill-Ill keep that in mind. (Turns and walks away.)
 Rachel: Phoebe! Its 6 oclock in the morning! Why arent you at Garys?
 Rachel: Phoebe are you okay?
 Rachel: Phoebe honey wanna get some breakfast?
 Rachel: Yeah it is amazing it lasted that long.
 Rachel: No I meant with the dropper over here. (Points at Chandler.)
 Rachel: Well my eye is a little itchy.
 Rachel: Richard? Im not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
 Rachel: Well Im sorry Im not going to an eye doctor!
 Rachel: (flinches) Ross! Come on! Thats all right! Fine--Okay I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
 Rachel: (flinches again) Monica! Come on!
 Rachel: (freaks) Ross! Stop it! Come on!
 Rachel: Chandler!
 Rachel: Just stop it! Come on!
 Rachel: (entering from her bedroom) All right! Lets get this over with! Ugh! (She walks by the table and notices that no one is looking and accidentally on purpose knocks over the open cereal box.) Ohhh! No! Look what I did! (She starts walking through the mess. {Also notice the continuity error in this scene. Note the position of the box and dispersal pattern of the cereal before and after the camera cut.}) Oh I mean look at this mess! I mean were probably gonna have to clean this up! Yknow? Were gonna have to reschedule!
 Rachel: Oh my God! What does that thing do?
 Rachel: All right Im outta here!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: So were done then!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Uh-huh.

 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Okay. Okay!
 Rachel: (really excited) Great!! It was very very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! (He took out that thing they use to look at peoples retinas and looked at Rachels when she was shaking his hand causing her to flinch and scream at him.)
 Rachel: Yeah no I dont-I dont put things in my eye.
 Rachel: Great!
 Rachel: Okay just give me the damn drops! (Grabs them and storms out.)
 Rachel: Yknow I-I gotta tell ya those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
 Rachel: Damn!
 Rachel: Bye you guys!
 Rachel: Oh honey Ill say good-bye to you at the car if you dont mind the puss.
 Rachel: Well wait a minute! The puss is good! It means its healing! (Runs after him.)
 Rachel: Oh did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
 Rachel: Eh! Stop it!
 Rachel: Okay. (She tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. The only problem is its not over her eye.)
 Rachel: Okay then yknow what? Help me! I need help! I cant do this!
 Rachel: All right!
 Rachel: All right.
 Rachel: Yes!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Okay they are. (No theyre not.)
 Rachel: (thinks) Four.
 Rachel: Really?!
 Rachel: Okay!
 Rachel: Great!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Well well you said it was practice!
 Rachel: Because I knew you were lying!
 Rachel: (as shes being dragged) What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it! (Monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)
 Rachel: Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
 Rachel: Monica! Stop it!
 Rachel: Wow yknow if Joey and Chandler walked in right now we could make a fortune! (Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risqu� pose at least for primetime TV.)
 Rachel: Yep!
 Rachel: What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
 Rachel: Oh! (Shes trying to recover while still on the floor.)
 Rachel: Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
 Rachel: No! No! Its just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
 Rachel: (under her breath) Sucker!
 Rachel: (entering with Ross) Hi!
 Rachel: Well I guess I could take a couple days off work.
 Rachel: Oh no wait a minute wait Ive got a presentation tomorrow. I cant miss that.
 Rachel: That sounds great.
 Rachel: Okay. Yeah that would be nice actually to have the apartment to myself for a night.
 Rachel: No! So I can be by myself. Yknow? Have a little alone time.
 Rachel: No! Phoebe just because Im alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean you live alone you dont walk around naked.
 Rachel: (takes off her robe) Oh! Look what happened! {Dont get your hopes up guys we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franzs butt.} (In her head.) Huh check me out! Im in my kitchen…naked! Im picking up an orange. (Does so) Im naked! (Goes into the living room) Lighting the candles naked and carefully. (She backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her body away.)
 Rachel: (singing) Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! (Theres a knock on the door she turns off the music puts on her robe and goes to answer the door.) Love to love ya baby! (Theres another knock.) Darnit! (Looks through the peephole and turns on the lights.) Ugh. (She opens the door to Ross whos leaning against the door jam.)
 Rachel: Uh yeah if you want too.
 Rachel: Yeah sure?
 Rachel: And um what-what is that Ross?
 Rachel: (laughs) What?! Are you crazy?
 Rachel: (gasps) Oh God you saw me?! Oh!
 Rachel: Noo!! No! You thought you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
 Rachel: Ohh wow! I’m sorry but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
 Rachel: Yes of course absolutely! Youre right. Im sorry.
 Rachel: Yes.
 Rachel: Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm do-do we still need to uh settle the question of us?
 Rachel: (taking off her sweater) Okay umm Ross? Im-Im really warm so Im going to be taking off my sweater. Now Im just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
 Rachel: Im sorry. Im done. Im done.
 Rachel: No not really. I mean youve seen me naked hundreds of times.
 Rachel: Okay. All right thats true! But yknow I just dont embarrass that easily.
 Rachel: No I dont! Ross I think Im just a more secure person than you are.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Yeah all right. All right! Just keep walkin! All right?
 Rachel: Ross! What are you… Im sorry sir. I just I think he just really likes you.
 Rachel: (to the flight attendant who appears in record time. It was only seconds after Rachel pushed the call button was she there. Once again more proof that TV isnt real IRL she wouldve been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then Rosss pants would be dry.) Hi!
 Rachel: Yes Im sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm my friend seems to have had a little accident.
 Rachel: Yes I did. Thank you very much it was excellent. (Disembarks)
 Rachel: Ahh.
 Rachel: Hello! (She makes a face and the kid laughs harder. Finally his parents drag him off.) Ohh kids love me.
 Rachel: Hi! (Hugs Phoebe)
 Rachel: Pancho Vila?
 Rachel: What are you talking about Pheebs? (Takes out her compact) I dont… (She gasps when she looks in the mirror and sees her face.) (To Ross) Oh my God you drew on me?!
 Rachel: Ross I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can—you have so crossed a line. (Heads for the bathroom)
 Rachel: (returning with her purse covering her face) All right it wont come off!
 Rachel: It wont come off!
 Rachel: No actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
 Rachel: Hi!!
 Rachel: Hi. (She hugs Joey.)
 Rachel: What?! What else did he say?
 Rachel: Ross no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
 Rachel: Ross I am a human doodle!!
 Rachel: Okay I need a I need a drink! (Makes a beeline for the mini-bar.)
 Rachel: (shes finished reliving the fridge of its entire alcohol content.) Macadamia nut?
 Rachel: Hm-mmm! (Opens the container)
 Rachel: Nope! (She puts one in her mouth and spits it out then does it again in another direction.)
 Rachel: Oh my God Im starting to look like my great aunt Muriel.
 Rachel: Hit me!
 Rachel: I bet 20.
 Rachel: Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (She slows down with each one.)
 Rachel: Yeah and also we need more umm drinks. Hold on a second. (Gets up but stumbles a little bit.) Whup okay. (She makes it to the phone and picks it up without dialing.) Hello! Vegas? Yeah we would like some more alcohol and yknow what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh I forgot to dial!
 Rachel: Ohh I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck! (Goes and hugs Joey.)

 Rachel: Well hello Mr. Rachel! (Throws some more rice.)
 Rachel: Wait! (Gets her bearings) Okay!

 Rachel: I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
 Rachel: Really?!
 Rachel: Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
 Rachel: Ohh I mean we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.
 Rachel: (To Ross) I don’t know. (To the gang.) What do you mean last night? Nothing nothing uh happened last night.
 Rachel: (gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)
 Rachel: No we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous!
 Rachel: Oh my God.
 Rachel: No!
 Rachel: Well I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)
 Rachel: Hey hubby!
 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: Okay! So we’ll just stay married.
 Rachel: And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
 Rachel: Okay see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think you’re kidding.
 Rachel: What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!
 Rachel: Ohh okay I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We absolutely can stay married because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right look just please take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me.
 Rachel: You are asking me to be your wife!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: (thinks about it for a second) No! Ross come on! No! Listen look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line Ross is we can not stay married.
 Rachel: Oh b-b-but it is!
 Rachel: Oh Ross come on! This is not this is not a marriage!! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross listen if you do not get this annulment I will!
 Rachel: Thank you. (He goes to leave.) Hey-hey umm uh is there is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
 Rachel: Huh that’s funny. You look like you’re gonna be the…

 Rachel: Hey so did everything go all right with the annulment?
 Rachel: Ross thank you. Hey do you guys wanna go see a movie?
 Rachel: Pheebs?
 Rachel: Okay umm I’m gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)
 Rachel: Hey so did everything go okay with the annulment?
 Rachel: Ross thank you. Hey do you guys wanna go see a movie?
 Rachel: Okay umm I’m gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)
 Rachel: Oh? Yeah! Sure!
 Rachel: Oh but Phoebe we’re gonna be late for the movie.
 Rachel: Yeah we’re we’re actually just gonna walk ‘cause it’s right up there at the Angelica.
 Rachel: (to the driver) Okay stop-stop! Phoebe?!
 Rachel: What was that?!
 Rachel: I haven’t seen it yet!
 Rachel: Noooooooo!!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Ugh the worse day! Y’know you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
 Rachel: I believe you. So it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys!
 Rachel: And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
 Rachel: And Chandler you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late.
 Rachel: Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God… (Gasps and starts to sing) Come and knock on my door…
 Rachel: (entering) Hey roomie!
 Rachel: (gasps) Are you pregnant?!
 Rachel: Um-hmm.
 Rachel: (laughs) Oh my God! Oh that’s funny I can’t believe I did that.
 Rachel: Okay. (Sits back and resumes her reading.)
 Rachel: Sure? (Monica hands her one.) Thanks.
 Rachel: Monica where did you get these?!
 Rachel: Ooh good God they’re so yummy! (She re-ingests the previously expelled cookie matter from the tissue.)
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Okay!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: (grabbing the star) What the hell is that?
 Rachel: Wow! Mon thanks! I love this plate!
 Rachel: Mon honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time.
 Rachel: Are you okay? You’re not blinking.
 Rachel: Oh all right. But y’know I gotta say I don’t I don’t think six years counts as an era.
 Rachel: What is the matter with you?!
 Rachel: All right fine but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just a little hard to believe.
 Rachel: Well y’know it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y’know? I mean you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m sorry.
 Rachel: But I…
 Rachel: It is? Really?
 Rachel: (starting to lose her composure) I mean we’re not we’re not gonna live together anymore?
 Rachel: What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much! (Starts to cry.)
 Rachel: I mean it’s the end of an era!
 Rachel: Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: (entering from her room) Pheebs I wanna ask you something.
 Rachel: Well since I’m movin’ out and-and you’re so beautiful…
 Rachel: …how about I move in with you?
 Rachel: You have a roommate?!
 Rachel: Oh that’s true.
 Rachel: Yeah yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place.
 Rachel: Pheebs I have to ask you…
 Rachel: You’re just staring into space.
 Rachel: This one? (Picks it up.)
 Rachel: Pheebs this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean look at this; (Points to one and starts to read it.) Wanted. Female roommate non-smoker non-ugly. It’s just there is nothing! The city’s full!
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Yeah! Why?
 Rachel: That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love Warren! Thank you!
 Rachel: Oh this is great! I am gonna call him right now! (Jumps up.) Oh thank you!
 Rachel: (returning from calling Warren) Ugh!!! Well the apartment is already subletted! I mean this is just hopeless. I’m never gonna find anything.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Oh my God! Are you serious?!
 Rachel: I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank you!
 Rachel: Ross-Ross you have no idea what this means to me! I mean I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!
 Rachel: Oh I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! (Kisses him on the cheek and exits.)
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Oh thanks but listen I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.
 Rachel: No-no they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
 Rachel: Yeah I feel kinda bad for them but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here!
 Rachel: No-no I’m staying put.
 Rachel: Why where are you going?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Oh wow.
 Rachel: Yeah. Y’know umm uh umm about that umm Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything but don’t you think it’s gonna be weird?
 Rachel: Well because of us! Because of our history.
 Rachel: No?
 Rachel: No! Not at all!
 Rachel: Okay but Ross eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
 Rachel: Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend you’re gonna have a girlfriend…
 Rachel: But y’know what if you think it’s gonna be okay we’ll just work out a system. Y’know it’ll be like college I’ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign Come back later I’m gettin’ lucky. (Laughs.)
 Rachel: Umm well let’s see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
 Rachel: No the other thing. I really think it’s great they work things out.
 Rachel: Hey can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
 Rachel: Thank you. (Gets up) Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy there’s no turning back.
 Rachel: All right well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later.
 Rachel: Well it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.
 Rachel: So which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
 Rachel: And?
 Rachel: Look at that!
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: No-no I bought those.
 Rachel: Yeah. (Rachel walks away.)
 Rachel: Well who wouldn’t?!
 Rachel: And Mrs.?!
 Rachel: What?!!
 Rachel: Ohh! Oh God! (Laughs her way into the living room.)
 Rachel: Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?
 Rachel: Ross hey you know what might make it less boring?
 Rachel: Some uh some visual aides.
 Rachel: Hey Pheebs you’re still alive! How are you doing?
 Rachel: Pheebs what-what are you doing?
 Rachel: Oh yeah scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you forever. Pheebs you lie down?
 Rachel: Monica!
 Rachel: Did-did you take these back?
 Rachel: Oh yeah they’re really great! Aren’t they?
 Rachel: Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Wow that’s great Ross I’m sorry we weren’t more supportive before.

 Rachel: Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
 Rachel: Really? Really?!
 Rachel: Okay! (Picks up the phone and starts dialing.) (In an Irish accent) Hello Ross this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University we’d like you to come on board with us full time! (Hangs up.)
 Rachel: Hey!

 Rachel: Ross got married again—Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
 Rachel: Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh I could just kill you!!!!
 Rachel: I cannot believe that you didn’t tell me that we are still married!!
 Rachel: When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! (To All) Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.
 Rachel: So I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross’s and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
 Rachel: Well maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
 Rachel: Well there’s an idea!!
 Rachel: That would be great! Wait how long is Denise gone for?
 Rachel: December 26th huh maybe she’s Santa Clause.
 Rachel: (deadpan) Oh look who it is my husband. The apple of my eye.
 Rachel: Well sure if you say you’re gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! (Grabs them from him.) All right now I’m gonna do this my way and I don’t want to hear a peep out of you!
 Rachel: Op! You’re peeping!
 Rachel: Ross! Y’know what I just got—why? Why did you do this?!
 Rachel: I don’t wanna hear Three failed marriages!
 Rachel: Well y’know what? Thanks to you I’m half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross I don’t think I have ever been this angry!
 Rachel: Ugh! (Stares at him.)
 Rachel: Yes your honor and here are are forms all filled out.
 Rachel: Uh yes heroin and crack.
 Rachel: Well you would know.
 Rachel: (starts to cry) Ross please I found the magazines!
 Rachel: Ugh!
 Rachel: Ross! Your honor rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! (To the stenographer) And could you strike Consummated like bunnies from the record?
 Rachel: Well yes we got married in Vegas and uh and the names I think.
 Rachel: (stands up as well) What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
 Rachel: (to the judge) Okay do you see do you see what you’re keeping me married too?!
 Rachel: All right look lady here is the deal I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
 Rachel: And thank you for your time. (They both beat a hasty retreat.)
 Rachel: This is totally your fault!
 Rachel: Well you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!
 Rachel: Don’t call us that! (Storms away)
 Rachel: (deadpan) Oh honey thank God you’re home I was getting worried.
 Rachel: Oh little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything!
 Rachel: Oh name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
 Rachel: Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
 Rachel: Nothing. (Sits down.)
 Rachel: Uh-hmm. (Just as Rachel finishes signing her name Ross yanks each page out of the way.)
 Rachel: Okay Ross we’re—wait a minute. Umm I uh I kinda have a little confession.
 Rachel: Well y’know this whole marriage thing kinda my idea.
 Rachel: Well remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
 Rachel: And uh yeah I didn’t really I didn’t want to say anything but it kinda it just it kinda kept coming back to me and umm remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a as a compromise we decided first to get married and then (Ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes. So umm sorry I got us into this mess.
 Rachel: Yeah don’t push it though.
 Rachel: I know. I always thought if you and I got married it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn’t be a secret and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. (They both laugh.)
 Rachel: No it was on the house it was it was a newlywed special.
 Rachel: Hey thanks Ross for taking care of all of this.
 Rachel: I’m gonna need a copy of those.
 Rachel: (entering from her room) Pheebs I was wondering…
 Rachel: Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
 Rachel: Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
 Rachel: Yeah yeah I know.
 Rachel: Surprise!!
 Rachel: No no don’t get mad because look—this is what happened. So I-I started packing then I realized What am I doing? I am lousy at packing! Right? But you love packing! So as a gift to you on our last night ta-da!
 Rachel: Ohhhhhh look it’s the roller blades.
 Rachel: You remember when we got these?
 Rachel: I guess you weren’t there. (They hug.)
 Rachel: I’m sorry Pheebs I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.
 Rachel: I have one.
 Rachel: Uh well I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen. (Laughs. Monica lags behind the laugh a little bit.)
 Rachel: You get your messages!
 Rachel: So-so you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
 Rachel: Ooh your brother. Score!
 Rachel: You know what else I’m not gonna miss? I’m Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!
 Rachel: I’m Monica I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!
 Rachel: Oh my God I can’t find a boyfriend! So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!
 Rachel: I’m unpacking!
 Rachel: I’m not moving! (She re-hangs a picture crookedly.) Is that picture straight?
 Rachel: Hey y’know what? You’re the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
 Rachel: Well it’s mine too! What else you got?!
 Rachel: Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! (She knocks over Monica grabs a box and runs into the kitchen.)
 Rachel: Great! Monica’s moving!
 Rachel: Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (Monica starts chasing Rachel around the table.)
 Rachel: Yeah I’m just mad!
 Rachel: Funny because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
 Rachel: Well Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
 Rachel: Oh really? Like what Monica?
 Rachel: Oh yeah good start Mon.
 Rachel: Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet.
 Rachel: Yeah I do. I-I do do that.
 Rachel: Well y’know I don’t want you to be cold.
 Rachel: Oh it’s gonna be fine.
 Rachel: But honey I think she’s moving in with Chandler.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Oh! I have your key. Here you go. (Hands it to Monica.)
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Oh God! This is silly I’m gonna see you in a couple of hours! (They hug again.)
 Rachel: Bye house!
 Rachel: Bye Mon.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Hi...
 Rachel: Rachel...
 Rachel: Phoebe’s...
 Rachel: leave...
 Rachel: Wait I-I just said leave.
 Rachel: Phoebe come on thats silly.
 Rachel: No I have all of the good words. OK fine fine we can switch.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Everybody…
 Rachel: Rachel…
 Rachel: Phoebe’s…
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Phoebe come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why dont you come with me?!
 Rachel: Yeah itll be fun. Well run in the park. Itll be like our first y’know roommate bonding thing.
 Rachel: Yeah and theres really cute guys there.
 Rachel: OK!
 Rachel: Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
 Rachel: Okay. (Runs off.)
 Rachel: You guys Im telling you when she runs she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
 Rachel: Oh! I used to do that too!
 Rachel: Aw Mon...(Kisses her on the cheek)
 Rachel: Yeah yeah and you know what I know shes gonna wanna run again I just dont know how to get out of it I mean I live with her.
 Rachel: Youre right youre right. I should just tell her the truth.
 Rachel: Pheebs Monica tripped me I dont think I can ever run again ever!
 Rachel: Ankle.
 Rachel: No no Phoebe no I was...no. You know what I was I was actually just checking to see if I could run. And I can!
 Rachel: No wait Phoebe.
 Rachel: Hey Phoebe can I talk to you for a second?
 Rachel: Okay um I...(Phoebe walks into her room.) All right Phoebe look I just wanted to say that Im sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
 Rachel: Well I-I shouldve told you the truth.
 Rachel: Well yknow the reason I didnt wanna go running with you is because um well yknow the way that you run is a little...(Starts flapping her arms)
 Rachel: Well its embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
 Rachel: Because theyre people.
 Rachel: Yes but still. Theyre people…with eyes.
 Rachel: I-I am not uptight—Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen I am not uptight man.
 Rachel: (Runs into Phoebe.) Hey!
 Rachel: Oh honey Im so sorry you were right this feels great!
 Rachel: Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. (Turns and bumps into a mounted policeman and falls) Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry! (Runs off.)
 Rachel: Ohh are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Well sure but they might think it’s kinda weird considering I don’t work there anymore.
 Rachel: I-I got a job at Ralph Lauren.
 Rachel: Yeah. (chuckling) A year ago..
 Rachel: But Pheebs you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn’t like me very much.
 Rachel: Sure.
 Rachel: Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
 Rachel: What? What!?! You kissed him?
 Rachel: (Gasps) Phoebe are you serious?
 Rachel: Phoebe I mean you do know he’s married?
 Rachel: Phoebe…
 Rachel: Oh Kim Hi. (Kim doesn’t even look up from her report.)
 Rachel: So you know I…I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
 Rachel: Ahh….So…Wow…The spring line it’s really going to be great this year huh?
 Rachel: So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room. (Kim stops the elevator and turns to Rachel.)
 Rachel: Yeah. Your teeth? Yes I saw them from outside. (Sitting down on the couch.) You guys are never going to believe this. But Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
 Rachel: Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just…made out. And the craziest thing is now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.
 Rachel: That-that is your make out buddy. Don’t you recognize him? (Holding up the magazine in front of her face.) Oh wait. Ohh Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh My God Phoebe that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copy guy.
 Rachel: Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
 Rachel: To get you to make out with him!!!
 Rachel: Ohh hi Kim.
 Rachel: Yeah remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn’t happen.
 Rachel: Okay two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well it turns out that’s not true.
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: Oh no no no. Oh God you think I made out with him.
 Rachel: I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my keycard. (The elevator stops. Ralph steps on.)
 Rachel: Now she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
 Rachel: I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
 Rachel: You were with Kenny today weren’t you?
 Rachel: Ohh Phoebe what am I going to do?
 Rachel: I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean I could but I wouldn’t.
 Rachel: That wouldn’t help me.
 Rachel: Kim hi.
 Rachel: Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
 Rachel: (Faking crying.) Yeah he dumped me. He said Rachel I can’t do this. Even though you are a very very very beautiful women. I can’t do this. I’m married and I’m sorry. And then I don’t know why but he said and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine.
 Rachel: Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.
 Rachel: You and Ralph?
 Rachel: Hey! Hey Pheebs check it out. Yeah for my desert I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
 Rachel: (worried) Nothing?
 Rachel: So if-if I mess this up there’s nothing else for dessert?
 Rachel: Wow Monica I love that you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question how do you know when uh the butter’s done?
 Rachel: Her dancer friends?
 Rachel: Really?!
 Rachel: I dunno. Y’know to me he’ll always be “Jack Geller walks in while you’re changing.”
 Rachel: (looking at her truffle) Look at it isn’t it beautiful?
 Rachel: It’s a truffle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers then a layer of jam then custard which I made from scratch [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries more ladyfingers then beef sauteed with peas and onions [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then a little more custard and then bananas and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
 Rachel: The beef? Yeah that was weird to me too. But then y’know I thought “well there’s mincemeat pie” I mean that’s an English dessert these people just put very strange things in their food y’know. [To Joey] Oh! by the way can I borrow some Rum from your place?
 Rachel: (teasingly) And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste.
 Rachel: Joey God your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
 Rachel: No!
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: (sarcastically) No I did but tell me again because it’s so romantic.
 Rachel: Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybodys gonna be like “Oh remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”
 Rachel: So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it alright?
 Rachel: Okay...
 Rachel: What’s up Ross?
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Oh no. No Ross don’t do this.
 Rachel: I just- I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea.
 Rachel: I thought this might happen today. Ross I know the holidays can be rough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
 Rachel: No I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you’re [pity-tone] alone alone. And I just-it’s just not the time for us. I’m sorry.
 Rachel: Joey you’re gonna have to stop rushing me you know what? You don’t get any dessert.
 Rachel: No I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay everybody it’s trifle time!
 Rachel: It sure is.
 Rachel: Beef.
 Rachel: Alright Monica I want you to have the first taste.
 Rachel: Oh oh oh wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
 Rachel: Op! Wait you dropped a pea.
 Rachel: Well?
 Rachel: Really? How good?
 Rachel: Okay now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
 Rachel: ...So a bird just grabbed it and then tried to fly away with it and and then just dropped it on the street?
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe do I wanna hear this?
 Rachel: (humoring Phoebe) Oh my God he dream-cheated on you!
 Rachel: (reading the recipe magazine finally figuring out that...) I wasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle!
 Rachel: You guys! It was bananas cream and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!
 Rachel: That’s a good story Grandpa.
 Rachel: So pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
 Rachel: Well I used to date him but you’re still going out with her!
 Rachel: Yeah but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah honey I’m sorry but I don’t think that was a romantic thing.
 Rachel: Well that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
 Rachel: Okay you look in the kitchen I will look in the back closet.
 Rachel: We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
 Rachel: Don’t worry we’re just gonna search here for an hour them we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search OK?
 Rachel: Chandler aren’t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
 Rachel: Chandler that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present two medium presents and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
 Rachel: That’s right!
 Rachel: Oh it’s a Macy’s bag!
 Rachel: (Reading) Dear losers do you really think I’d hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler I knew they’d break you.
 Rachel: We are so gonna find them this year.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Yeah we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
 Rachel: Well Chandler what is this very weird metal A Z thing?
 Rachel: Ha!
 Rachel: Yes okay oh by the way I just gotta say I think its really nice of you that even after youve moved you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
 Rachel: Hey this is hollow.
 Rachel: This bench it’s hollow! I can’t believe I never knew that! (She pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up) Oh the presents!!!
 Rachel: Oh this one’s for me!
 Rachel: Ooh let’s open them!
 Rachel: Whatever Linus I’m opening mine.
 Rachel: Uh wait so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
 Rachel: ‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then!
 Rachel: Yeah. Don’t do this to yourself.
 Rachel: I know.
 Rachel: Oh-oh Pottery Barn! (Grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds the rest back out to Chandler.) You can throw the rest away.
 Rachel: Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Shows her the picture.)
 Rachel: Yeah! It’s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
 Rachel: Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
 Rachel: Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
 Rachel: Okay fine! I’ll-I’ll just tell her it’s an antique apothecary table she doesn’t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Guess!
 Rachel: Ha! See I knew I knew you’d get it on the first guess. Isn’t it cool! It’s an apothecary table.
 Rachel: Ohh yes.
 Rachel: Almost.
 Rachel: It was only 500 bucks.
 Rachel: Oh okay see I thought I thought you meant how much was it when it was new y’know like back then.
 Rachel: Yeah no I mean it was at a flea market so it was y’know it was like a dollar.
 Rachel: And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Uh it’s from yore. Like the days of yore. Y’know?
 Rachel: Yes! That I know this is from White Plains.
 Rachel: Hey! We’re here!
 Rachel: (seeing his new table) Ohh! Oh my God!
 Rachel: Oh no!
 Rachel: Ross! Phoebe’s gonna be here any second she cannot see this!
 Rachel: I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she’s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
 Rachel: Because she hates Pottery Barn.
 Rachel: I know! I know she says it’s all mass-produced nothing is authentic and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (Ross looks at his table.) So come on she’s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
 Rachel: Ooo! Oh I forgot they made sheets!
 Rachel: Ross get over it! It’s not like she hates you.
 Rachel: Ross she’s not weird she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Ooh Phoebe’s here! Okay let’s turn out all the lights and we’ll just watch the movie!
 Rachel: He got it a flea market!
 Rachel: That’s funny. (Phoebe puts her feet up on Ross’s table.)
 Rachel: Ohh!!
 Rachel: Noooooo!! (Phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact same apothecary table they have.)
 Rachel: Oh my God Phoebe Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
 Rachel: Oh yes.
 Rachel: …see I can’t decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair the Sahara desk or the Parker console table.
 Rachel: I know I know. I went a little crazy.
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Oh it does it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
 Rachel: Well there’s yore. And uh y’know yesteryear.
 Rachel: Oh honey he doesn’t need my help.
 Rachel: (not sure of what to do) Y’know what? I don’t I don’t think Phoebe really wants to come.
 Rachel: Oh she does want to.
 Rachel: Pheebs I don’t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Yeah y’know what? Don’t look at it. (Realizes the display is their living room) Seriously don’t look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)
 Rachel: Ugh those bastards! Let’s go.
 Rachel: No! No! No! No it’s not! No it’s not! Come on! Phoebe ours is totally different! I mean we don’t have the… (Looks desperately for something different.) We don’t have the…that lamp! And-and that screen is y’know on the other side.
 Rachel: Okay! Okay-okay look—no I did I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just… Come on don’t be mad.
 Rachel: Well then honey buy the lamp! Hey we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
 Rachel: What?! No! I’m not gonna move out!
 Rachel: (gets it) Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
 Rachel: That’s right!
 Rachel: I’m sorry I was just reading the joke below it. Man that one is funny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)
 Rachel: We are looking at a Playboy.
 Rachel: Oh yeah sure. I mean like in the case of this young woman she has lost her clothes so she rides naked on the horse she’s crying out ‘Where are they where are they?’
 Rachel: You see now I would date this girl. She’s cute she’s outdoorsy you know and she knows how to build a fire. I mean that’s got to come in handy
 Rachel: (thinks) I don’t know.
 Rachel: Monica what are you doing?
 Rachel: (To Monica) Well people are different.
 Rachel: What? Wait a minute. What are you saying that I’m a pushover? I’m not a pushover.
 Rachel: Oh my … you think I’m a pushover. Well wait watch this you know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that’s pretty strong that’s what I think. Come on Monica let’s go to lunch. (She leaves)
 Rachel: I cannot believe her.
 Rachel: Oh oh I love that Japanese place.
 Rachel: All right wherever you wanna go is cool.
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: Joey honey I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.
 Rachel: Come on Joey I did it and it was fine.
 Rachel: Well you know what? This is great. Finally I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a long way. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
 Rachel: Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
 Rachel: Yes we are very sorry to tell you this but you Phoebe are flaky.
 Rachel: So what you’re just you’re just okay with being flaky?
 Rachel: Yeah and I am okay with being a pushover.
 Rachel: I am not a pushover!
 Rachel: Wow you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever heard.
 Rachel: How-how did you lose your job here?
 Rachel: He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not that’s not right.
 Rachel: Joey you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what I’m not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No I really shouldn’t say anything—No I should say something to him. (Goes to the counter) Gunther I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him…
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: That’s right he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go Joey you got your job back.
 Rachel: Yeah pretty nice huh? Now who’s a pushover?
 Rachel: Oh I’m sorry. (Gets up and moves.)
 Rachel: Oh yeah. Definitely you Pheebs.
 Rachel: Hey. Oh I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with who would you pick?
 Rachel: Wait a minute you’re only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
 Rachel: Honey no one thinks you’re a pansy but we do think you need a tissue. (She notices something hanging from Monica’s nose as does Joey.)
 Rachel: Oh my God Jill!
 Rachel: This is Chandler. (Points at him.)
 Rachel: And you know Monica and Ross!
 Rachel: And that’s Phoebe (points) and that’s Joey.
 Rachel: Don’t!! (Joey backs away frightened.) (To Jill) Honey what are you doing here?!
 Rachel: Wow! What did he say?
 Rachel: Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad’s proud of me! My dad’s proud of me.
 Rachel: Oh yeah sorry. Wait honey so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
 Rachel: Jill honey I think this is the best thing that could’ve ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it I-I-I at first I was scared and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay well this is this is what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna get a job you’re gonna get an apartment and then I’ll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs she can stay with us?
 Rachel: (entering) Hey! What’s goin’ on?
 Rachel: (notices Jill’s bags) Jill! Did you shop?!
 Rachel: You went shopping?! What and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill’s nose when you know she’s trying to quit. Wow you guys are terrible!
 Rachel: What’d you get?
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Apartment pants?
 Rachel: No of course of course I’ve heard of them! Ross what did you get?
 Rachel: A pajmena?
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Jill?
 Rachel: Oh come on! You think that’s gonna work on me?! I invented that!
 Rachel: All right it’s okay. One little setback is okay just don’t let it happen again all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff I should take it all away. But I’m just gonna take the-the pajmena. (Ross hands it to her.) And the uh and the uh pants. Y’know what I’m just gonna take it all away ‘cause that way you’ll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty I’m gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. (Leaves with all of Jill’s stuff.)
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: What’s up?!
 Rachel: Well it’d better not be about the apartment pants because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: With Ross and Jill?
 Rachel: With Ross and my sister?
 Rachel: With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
 Rachel: Oh there is no way.
 Rachel: Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it when Ross goes out with anyone but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?! Oh my God and they’re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t—I don’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister this terrible. Oh my God this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
 Rachel: (on the couch) Oh hi! Y’know I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
 Rachel: That is great. Hey y’know who doesn’t have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
 Rachel: Oh so you know that you guys talked about that so you get along so you think you’re gonna go out?
 Rachel: I just Phoebe said y’know thought she saw something between you guys.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Oh not-not so much. Umm what-what do you what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
 Rachel: Are-are you saying he’s a geek?
 Rachel: No! No I no Ross is not a geek!
 Rachel: What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
 Rachel: Oh no-no-no no-no-no that’s not what I meant.
 Rachel: Yeah but he’s not your type.
 Rachel: Yeah but you don’t you don’t you don’t want to try to much too fast. Y’know? I mean you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don’t you?
 Rachel: She-she died Jill.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Well yeah…
 Rachel: Really?!
 Rachel: Oh so-so not really never.
 Rachel: Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
 Rachel: Well I-I don’t like it.
 Rachel: It’s kinda slutty.
 Rachel: Yeah well I’m-I’m a slut.
 Rachel: Rachel.
 Rachel: Yeah I know and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it’s not!
 Rachel: Why aren’t you home yet?!
 Rachel: Oh yes it’s me! Sorry!
 Rachel: Uh I’m just I’m just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
 Rachel: (gasps) Oh he brought her back to his apartment.
 Rachel: Ugh she is a slut!
 Rachel: Oh my God look-look he’s taking off her clothes!
 Rachel: Oh this is just terrible.
 Rachel: Oh. (Squeaks again.)
 Rachel: Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
 Rachel: Yeah. And y’know who should’ve shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
 Rachel: Oh don’t even ask!
 Rachel: Oh Ross hi! Hey how are ya? There you are!

 Rachel: Ross thanks.
 Rachel: Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No I mean come on that’s-that’s crazy—I mean that’s crazy. So what’s-what’s going on with you? What is going on with you?
 Rachel: Yeah do it now call right now.
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
 Rachel: It’s not random it’s Bob.
 Rachel: No honey okay okay you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
 Rachel: Hm-mmm.
 Rachel: Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history…
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: (changing the subject) Y’know Bob in Human Resources…
 Rachel: Look this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross! There’s a million other guys out there you just…
 Rachel: I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
 Rachel: Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can’t have!
 Rachel: All right all right well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
 Rachel: In Human Resources!!!!!!
 Rachel: …I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
 Rachel: Do I have my own castle?
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: Wow! I mean I just—I can’t I can’t believe this. Y’know I mean you think you know someone even even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.
 Rachel: Absolutely not.
 Rachel: Probably just the first half.
 Rachel: Well it’s hard to tell… (Rachel gets up to get a closer look only she’s having some trouble.) Oh God if she would just stop moving.
 Rachel: Oh it’s a tattoo! That’s weird Phoebe doesn’t… Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula!
 Rachel: Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere.
 Rachel: Well is Ross home? Maybe I’ll just call him to see if he’s actually seen her.
 Rachel: (on phone) What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
 Rachel: Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
 Rachel: Ross I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
 Rachel: Oh! I knew it! What happened?
 Rachel: What?! You kissed!
 Rachel: Well it doesn’t sound like it! I mean it’s pretty easy not to kiss someone you just don’t kiss them! See look at us right now not kissing!
 Rachel: Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! Y’know what? Let me give you something to think about! (She pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.)
 Rachel: Oh well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Wow. I I don’t even know what to say. Thank you. (Gently kicks him.)
 Rachel: Yeah I got that.
 Rachel: Bye-bye-e!
 Rachel: Hey you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
 Rachel: Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
 Rachel: Yeah but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
 Rachel: Well apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad? (Giggles.) God could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
 Rachel: Merrill Lynch?
 Rachel: Well why didn’t you take the job?
 Rachel: (gasps) Rob Tillman!
 Rachel: Oh I’m sorry. Ross Tillman.
 Rachel: Ohh of course Monica’s brother!
 Rachel: Wow! How are you?!
 Rachel: Ohh! Me too!
 Rachel: Oh it’s the best! (They both exhale contemplating the joys of marriage.) So umm how’s Monica?
 Rachel: Ohh I would love too.
 Rachel: Ohh! Okay!
 Rachel: Oh wait don’t you have to pay for your (looks at his magazine) Busty Ladies?
 Rachel: (laughs) Oh yeah? Okay.
 Rachel: But! Don’t you have to give him his money back?
 Rachel: Ohh so do you! Did you lose weight? (She’s not quite sure of that one.)
 Rachel: Oh yeah.
 Rachel: Oh yeah. Right. So now are—do you do you still do music?
 Rachel: (interrupting him and seeing Joey) Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives just walked in here!
 Rachel: (stunned) You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
 Rachel: He’s coming over! He’s coming over!
 Rachel: (giggles and can’t look at him) Hi!
 Rachel: (still not quite able to look at him) Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you…
 Rachel: Ah!
 Rachel: Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: (laughs) Wow! Umm y’know I-I would really love to but I-I shouldn’t.
 Rachel: (awestruck then not) Isn’t that a line from the show?!
 Rachel: That’s a line from the show too!
 Rachel: Yeah sure iced tea would be great.
 Rachel: (mouthing it to him) Yes you did.
 Rachel: Oh Mon listen I have to ask! Okay Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment now does he do this with a lot of girls?
 Rachel: Ohh! And I’m one of them!! Wow! Oh I just cannot believe this! I mean Joey Tribbiani!
 Rachel: Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y’know I just wish we could be like on a break!
 Rachel: Oh it’s so easy for you I mean you’re not married you get to have sex with who ever you want!
 Rachel: Monica. You’ve you’ve done it right?
 Rachel: Oh my God! You’re a 30 year old virgin!
 Rachel: Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey you’ve waited long enough!!
 Rachel: Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions! Y’know people should be able to sleep with who ever they want whenever…
 Rachel: Oh what do you know? Virgin!
 Rachel: (very relived) Oh! Thank God!
 Rachel: Okay! (She picks up the phone Joey’s phone number and starts to dial.) Here we go! Okay! (On phone.) Hi Joey! It’s Rachel! Umm I am free tomorrow night. Yeah sure sure I can bring some sandwiches.
 Rachel: Ohh I mean it’s just so realistic!
 Rachel: Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! (Laughs and finishes her drink.)
 Rachel: Oh I probably shouldn’t—so I will! (Joey starts making her refill and Rachel notices that rain thing Joey has.) Oh! Wow! It’s like it’s raining!
 Rachel: Umm can I use your bathroom?
 Rachel: Okay. (Starts to go.) God y’know if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani’s apartment…
 Rachel: Yeah it sure is!
 Rachel: Joey you’re such an amazing actor! (He smiles.) How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
 Rachel: Wow! Tell me something Joey—(She falls off the couch)—Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
 Rachel: Okay. (She climbs back onto the couch.)
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Wow! I can’t I can’t feel my hands.
 Rachel: (wakes up suddenly and realizes where she is) Oh right.
 Rachel: (groans) Oh God. Oh I can’t believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
 Rachel: Noo! Oh God we did—we didn’t we didn’t uhh…
 Rachel: God I’m just a horrible person.
 Rachel: Because I’m married. That’s right I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star’s apartment to have an affair! Uck!
 Rachel: Yeah and I’m a horrible horrible person.
 Rachel: The ring from the cave yeah.
 Rachel: (seeing the ring and gasping) Oh my God they let you keep that stuff?!
 Rachel: No! No-no-no…
 Rachel: But I thought that ring stood for Caprice’s undying love for her brother.
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Ohh! My God! Barry!!
 Rachel: Oh that’s right! I’m sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
 Rachel: Hi Ross!
 Rachel: Is Joey Tribbiani here?
 Rachel: Well if you see him will you please tell him that I’m looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
 Rachel: Me? I’m great! I’m fine! I’m sooo good!! But you know who’s not great?! Men! You’re a man right Ross?!
 Rachel: Sit down!
 Rachel: Let me uh let me ask you something do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we’re going out of town bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor’s dog walker?!
 Rachel: No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
 Rachel: Aw what are you?! A detective?
 Rachel: Oh. (Doesn’t believe it.)
 Rachel: Who are these men?
 Rachel: Well you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is (whispers) gay.
 Rachel: Good day for married people huh?
 Rachel: I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great either.
 Rachel: Yeah kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there (points) and pretend you’re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
 Rachel: Isn’t that a kind of sushi?
 Rachel: Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
 Rachel: (To Phoebe) Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
 Rachel: Well Valentine’s Day was like two weeks ago so I wouldn’t get her a calendar!
 Rachel: Aw I love that.
 Rachel: (interrupting him) Okay-okay-okay! So making things. That sounds like so much fun.
 Rachel: Hey wait a minute! That is my sock!
 Rachel: What the hell was that?!
 Rachel: All right so we weren’t prepared!
 Rachel: Ahhhhh salmon skin roll. (She does the finger thing.)
 Rachel: Yep!
 Rachel: Oh of course!
 Rachel: Definitely! Phoebe you will not find a single game show host who’s ass I cannot kick.

 Rachel: Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
 Rachel: I… Well I don’t think they need any help.
 Rachel: Who wrote it?
 Rachel: Okay wait a minute wait a minute why are we so sure that this is a girl?

 Rachel: (on phone) Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! (Hangs up) That was the fire department there was a fire at our place!
 Rachel: Well he didn’t say but it was a fire. I’m guessing not very good. Come on we gotta go!
 Rachel: My God! (They both run into the bedrooms.)
 Rachel: Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater. (Hold it up.)
 Rachel: Fine! I’m sorry for your loss! (Hands it back to her.)
 Rachel: (stands up) Wow! Oh-okay look pal I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
 Rachel: Okay Phoebe calm down there’s no need to place blame. Okay? (To the fireman) I warned her about those candles.
 Rachel: Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here.
 Rachel: Hey! Hey-hey now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
 Rachel: Okay! (She jumps on the bed.)
 Rachel: I have.

 Rachel: I’m not paying for half of that! I’m only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
 Rachel: That refrigerators don’t live as long as people.

 Rachel: Thank God you’re pretty. (Exits.)
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Do you guys know any cute guys?
 Rachel: Anyway there’s this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table so I kinda have to go…
 Rachel: I don’t know something either trees or disease—Ralph mumbles a lot.
 Rachel: Yeah! It’s weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
 Rachel: Well someone that has his own tux or has the ability to rent a tux.
 Rachel: Oo! When’s her birthday?!
 Rachel: Well y’know it’s just been so long since I’ve been to Chuckie Cheese.
 Rachel: Hey! You guys umm I want you to meet Sebastian.
 Rachel: We just uh we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. (Chandler’s shocked.) What? I read that.
 Rachel: Oh yes! Thank you! (He does so and Rachel sits down on the couch.)
 Rachel: (shocked) What?
 Rachel: You found me a guy?
 Rachel: Well y’know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I’m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
 Rachel: Oh thank you.
 Rachel: What are you guys doing?
 Rachel: Oh but y’know no you didn’t give me your phone number.

 Rachel: I’m just sort of in the middle of something.
 Rachel: Okay y’know what? Maybe I should go!
 Rachel: Yeah I’m good.
 Rachel: No-no! Don’t dance for me! Please? Don’t! (She gets up to yell at her ‘friends.’) What is the matter with you guys?
 Rachel: I… Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
 Rachel: I’ll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It’s you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much but I do not need you to get me a date!
 Rachel: I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean no offense to you guys. Really! I mean (To Patrick) congratulations on all the cash (He nods) and-and y’know—(Feels Eldad’s hair)—Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! (Grabs her stuff starts to leave then turns back suddenly and to Eldad) Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
 Rachel: Thank you! (Storms out.)
 Rachel: Oh that’s all right! Y’know I ended up having a really good time. Y’know the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
 Rachel: I wanna say a disease.
 Rachel: Huh. All right.
 Rachel: Oh-oh Professor Geller.
 Rachel: So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
 Rachel: Huh—Wait so Joey if you get this you’re gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you’ll be like the Big Cheese! (To Phoebe) Or the Big Mac—Hey! You love those!
 Rachel: Joey what are you talking about? You’re a terrific actor.
 Rachel: Ugh how can you even ask that question?!
 Rachel:  Im sorry what?

 Rachel: Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
 Rachel: Already? That’s pretty bad what you did.
 Rachel: I’m sure he will forgive you. Look we have all been there! Y’know you fight you make up it’s just the way it works.
 Rachel: Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
 Rachel: What?!!

 Rachel: Yknow I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
 Rachel: And hey! Just so you know it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
 Rachel: That is the most ridiculous...
 Rachel: I did not sell you out.
 Rachel: Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead]
 Rachel: OK well you wouldnt let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]
 Rachel: Fine!
 Rachel: Okay Chandler!
 Rachel: And your horoscope says On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift.
 Rachel: Op but the twelfth brings a lover’s spat.
 Rachel: Oh wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
 Rachel: (ecstatic) Oh my God! It’s Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
 Rachel: Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: (To Phoebe) We do?

 Rachel: Oh! Ross is sooo great!
 Rachel: (seeing him) Oh hi!
 Rachel: Oh! Well let’s look for them. (Finds some under one of the couch cushions. It has a pink fuzzy ball on the key chain.) Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
 Rachel: All right! (Throws them back under the cushion.)
 Rachel: Oh good.
 Rachel: (chasing after him) Oh wait! Sorry Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
 Rachel: Paul. Umm I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
 Rachel: You just don’t look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
 Rachel: Oh. We?
 Rachel: Oh no! Yes! Of course I know that! I just—I meant y’know are you still a ‘We’ or are you just ‘You?’
 Rachel: (sympathetic) Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
 Rachel: Ohh. (She touches his arm for support and likes what she feels) Ooh!
 Rachel: I was just getting him to like you.
 Rachel: Ross Joey is not here.
 Rachel: Ross it’s okay. You can come out.
 Rachel: Bye!
 Rachel: Well y’know he lost his keys so he was looking for them…
 Rachel: No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y’know for like two hours and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
 Rachel: Ross what’s the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
 Rachel: Wh—You dated my sister!
 Rachel: What? Why?!
 Rachel: Ross look look this is good for you. Okay? Let’s face it so far the guy’s not lovin’ ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner y’know? And I can talk you up! Ross the guy is a very very successful lawyer!
 Rachel: Oh it’s important!
 Rachel: So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up so Ross selflessly offered to take me.
 Rachel: Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.
 Rachel: Oh we were but that was just a (pause as the audience reacts) I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
 Rachel: Oh! Whoops! I’m sorry you were talking about Emily!
 Rachel: I mean if you think about it I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
 Rachel: Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily he just didn’t tell me. (Everyone looks at her Ross not happily.) Maybe I have to pee again. (Gets up to try to use the bathroom.)
 Rachel: (returning) Wait-wait-wait I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
 Rachel: Oh! I’ve got a lot of those too!
 Rachel: What’s the matter?
 Rachel: So what-what is the exhibit.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
 Rachel: Umm.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Ooh the gift shop!
 Rachel: Oh wait yes but I can’t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight he said he has a big surprise planned.
 Rachel: What?! No! Why?!
 Rachel: I didn’t know you could get married here.
 Rachel: Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
 Rachel: Monica you should totally put your name down on the list
 Rachel: Yeah hon it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it.
 Rachel: I’m gonna do it too!
 Rachel: Really? Who would who would you marry?
 Rachel: Oh Pheebs.
 Rachel: (from another room) Oh my God what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
 Rachel: It’s so secluded up here.
 Rachel: I feel like we’re the only two people in the world. (She sets down her wine class picks up a walnut and knocks another one on the floor.) Oops. Sorry. (She reaches down to pick it up and Ross hands it to her. Ross is hiding under the couch and causes Rachel to scream.)
 Rachel: No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I—would you—actually would you go check on that?
 Rachel: Well okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
 Rachel: Okay. (After Paul leaves Rachel drops to the floor to confront Ross.) What?! What are you doing here?!
 Rachel: I came with Paul!
 Rachel: Get up!
 Rachel: Ahh. Thank you!
 Rachel: Op ice. I need ice.
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! (Ross gets up and heads for the kitchen.) No! Not in there! He’s in there! (She points Ross to the door next to the kitchen.)
 Rachel: Go-go!
 Rachel: Ohh thank you.
 Rachel: Well she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
 Rachel: Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
 Rachel: Well why do y’know go in that room (points to the room Ross is in) and do your homework?
 Rachel: That’s your that’s your dad’s bedroom. (Yelling) That’s your dad’s bedroom!
 Rachel: Whoa that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
 Rachel: Really? Okay. Okay I-I’ll go upstairs. (to Paul) If-if you get me something from the car.
 Rachel: Surprise me.
 Rachel: (yelling) So you’re gonna be in the car I will be upstairs and that’s where everybody’s gonna be!
 Rachel: (yelling from the living room) Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don’t go in there! Don’t go in there! I need another soda!
 Rachel: Oh my God Ross! What in heaven’s name are you doing here?
 Rachel: Good. Although y’know he-he’s a private guy. Y’know I wish I could get him to open up a little bit share some feelings.
 Rachel: So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: (To Phoebe) Okay.
 Rachel: Okay. (Gets up and starts to leave with Paul.)
 Rachel: Yeah that’s great. But first wait talk to me talk to me. Tell me about your day.
 Rachel: Okay. Hey what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
 Rachel: Yeah that’s great Paul but y’know I wanna know what—(Puts her hands on his shoulders)—Wow those are really great! I just wanna know what what is behind this-this strong silent exterior. Y’know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
 Rachel: No Paul I don’t know anything about you! Y’know like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
 Rachel: Okay well then how about puberty! Come on that’s always a painful time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
 Rachel: Well you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway umm… The rest of you life y’know? Any regrets?
 Rachel: All right Paul I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: All right.
 Rachel: Hm-mmm.
 Rachel: That’s-that’s great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay come on. Now we can go eat. Let’s go. (Gets up to leave but Paul doesn’t move.)
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Yeah. Yeah I-I-I see the scare. Listen Paul I think this is really great that-that y’know you shared your feelings. It’s really it’s beautiful but umm what do you say we go share some food?
 Rachel: What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
 Rachel: My God I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I wouldn’t do that!
 Rachel: Oh my God! Oh my God!!
 Rachel: Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God I didn’t know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy clingy moist monster!
 Rachel: What’s the other one?
 Rachel: Oh that’s right. You’re the talker. (They both reflect on that briefly) Anyway uh great idea! Umm I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
 Rachel: No you don’t!
 Rachel: Hi. I’m back.
 Rachel: Ah that’s great. No actually that’s… (In a sexy voice) That’s great! That’s really great! Y’know I gotta tell ya writing I mean writing gets me uh gets me kinda hot.
 Rachel: A lover?
 Rachel: Oh yeah surfer?
 Rachel: Okay hold on real quick hold on a second let me just uh (sits on the counter and buttons her sweater to show some cleavage) get a little more comfortable here. Wait now wait a second this isn’t too revealing is it?
 Rachel: I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y’know the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
 Rachel: Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’t mean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming.
 Rachel: I’m so glad I’m so glad you shared. (Feeling his shoulder.) And I’m glad that you’re done. What do you say we umm… (Nods in the direction of the bedroom.)
 Rachel: (who has just entered) Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby I’ll dump you too!
 Rachel: Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! (Hugs him.) You guys are gonna be so happy!
 Rachel: (gasps) Nice! One and a half carat easy.
 Rachel: Yeah? Well you should know. You’ve bought like a billion of ‘em.
 Rachel: Ohh…
 Rachel: (entering) Hey!
 Rachel: Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring the better I look. So Monica? Chandler?
 Rachel: Oh my God I’m so sorry.
 Rachel: How about you guys? (Points to Phoebe and Joey.)
 Rachel: I think so.
 Rachel: Hey! Ross listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
 Rachel: See? Now he could date her.
 Rachel: (breaking up) We’re just really…very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
 Rachel: Oh! Thank you!
 Rachel: Uh well uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
 Rachel: (suddenly worried) Uh wh-why?
 Rachel: Oh hi!
 Rachel: Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson this is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Mr. Thompson. (She introduces them.) He’s the head of my department.
 Rachel: And I also brought my friend Joey…
 Rachel: Well y’know I-I don’t know where he is.
 Rachel: Well y’know what? Actually I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Thank you. (Mr. Thompson walks away and after he’s left.) Okay (writing her bid down) twenty dollars.
 Rachel: Ugh! So close!
 Rachel: What are you doing?
 Rachel: Well now it’s an empty bar.
 Rachel: What?! What?! What?!
 Rachel: Joey! It is an auction! You don’t guess you buy!
 Rachel: Joey! Sit down! (Pulls him down.)
 Rachel: What were you thinking?!
 Rachel: Wh?!
 Rachel: Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
 Rachel: Ugh!
 Rachel: Phoebe don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink?
 Rachel: How is you drinking helping the kids?
 Rachel: Joey! Joey good one! (Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)
 Rachel: (stopping him) Hey! You…can’t…leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave my boss is gonna kill me!
 Rachel: I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. All right this is what we’re gonna do we are gonna go to the next highest bidder and we are just gonna let them buy it and then you’re just gonna pay the difference.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Not great.
 Rachel: Oh great!
 Rachel: (To Phoebe) Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
 Rachel: Oh well hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18000.

 Rachel: Pam! Oh God okay just imagine this The Pam.
 Rachel: Okay uh-uh imagine this The Mr. Bowmont.

You-you get all that peace and quiet that you’ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin’! You can—ooh you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain and then when you’re old Cappy.
 Rachel: (To Joey) What?! What?!
 Rachel: But Joey you don’t have $20000!
 Rachel: (entering) Hey! (Sees Monica gasps and runs over to her.) Oh my God you’re here let me see your hand!!
 Rachel: Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler gettin’ married.
 Rachel: Ohh… I mean two best friends falling in love how often does that happen?
 Rachel: No! I’m so happy for them!
 Rachel: I’m so happy and not at all jealous.
 Rachel: I mean I’m probably 98% happy maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing.
 Rachel: Yeah me too.
 Rachel: (staring at him) Wh—no but y’know who did stop in here looking for ya Tennille.
 Rachel: We’re gonna find love!
 Rachel: Yeah I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
 Rachel: Well y’know some people make deals with a friend like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40 they marry each other.
 Rachel: Exactly!
 Rachel: You do?
 Rachel: Who?
 Rachel: Joey?!
 Rachel: Are you serious?!
 Rachel: Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40 you’re gonna marry Joey.
 Rachel: Oh seriously?
 Rachel: Charming.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Hey you!
 Rachel: Oh thank you. Hey y’know I’m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
 Rachel: Yeah love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it?
 Rachel: So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we’re 40 we get married. I mean we know each other we like each other and we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like What’s that?!
 Rachel: Exactly.
 Rachel: What? Who?
 Rachel: Phoebe?! Wait a—but-but she just she said that Joey was her backup.
 Rachel: Ross! I just had a conversation with her and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
 Rachel: Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!
 Rachel: Oh God Phoebe!
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Okay y’know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin (does so) and I’m gonna right Ross on the other napkin (does so) and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
 Rachel: Pick one.
 Rachel: You’re welcome.
 Rachel: (reading) Joey! (Pause) We should just switch.
 Rachel: Ohhh this is the least jealous I’ve ever been!
 Rachel: Oh hell he’s done this three times! He knows what its about!
 Rachel: Yeah Pheebs honey she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she’s even had time to…
 Rachel: (To Monica) Yeah you’re on your own.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: (quietly) Oh thanks.
 Rachel: I don’t know y’know? I feel a little umm… No y’know what? Nevermind I’m gonna be fine.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Well thank you you too.
 Rachel: Hey do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
 Rachel: Ohh…
 Rachel: Yeah I guess. I-I… I mean do-do you think we’re ever gonna have that?
 Rachel: Oh no-no-no-no-no no no! We you with someone and me with someone.
 Rachel: Shake it off.
 Rachel: No absolutely. Y’know like it was umm…
 Rachel: Yeah just give me a minute! (Thinking) Oh well yes I can think of one good thing.
 Rachel: Well you uh you were always really good at the uh at the uh the stuff.
 Rachel: Uh-hmm uh-hmm yeah yeah I really liked your hands.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: Oh I know. Hey y’know what we never did? (Ross looks at her.) Oh no not that. (Ross nods okay.) We uh we never had bonus night!
 Rachel: Y’know bonus night. Y’know when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
 Rachel: Yeah-yeah we never had that
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh honey but it is just about…
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
 Rachel: Honey I swear it we just kissed.
 Rachel: Okay come on Phoebe it’s nothing! Monica come on!
 Rachel: No!
 Rachel: No-no it’s really not huge.
 Rachel: Joey you are not! You’re 31.
 Rachel: Honey Monica this is ridiculous! Look…
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn’t want to talk especially with me? I mean why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
 Rachel: Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously what did she mean by that? (Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!
 Rachel: I care!
 Rachel: Y’know what I-I have to go talk to her would you let me just get changed?
 Rachel: Am I going to let you watch me undress?
 Rachel: Monica what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want to talk to anyone especially me?
 Rachel: No-no seriously-seriously what was the especially me part about?
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Monica what are you talking about?
 Rachel: Monica y’know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
 Rachel: Oh!!
 Rachel: Monica your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
 Rachel: Ugh Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder!
 Rachel: All right easy mimey the moment has passed it ain’t gonna happen!
 Rachel: I swear I never wanted any part of your night!
 Rachel: (ignoring them) Monica why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
 Rachel: Oh wow. That—y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross let’s go have sex!
 Rachel: We’re not gonna do this all right? She’s just gonna think that we’re doin’ it.
 Rachel: Who is it?
 Rachel: Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to follow her lead but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)
 Rachel: Yeah you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May we help you?
 Rachel: All right Monica do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
 Rachel: No you don’t know why!
 Rachel: Because! Because I was sad.
 Rachel: Look I am so…so happy for you guys but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
 Rachel: Anyway sweetie I am I’m so sorry I ruined your night.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Yeah so let’s get started on the wedding plans!
 Rachel: Yeah we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers the caterers the music…
 Rachel: Oh wait Chandler too many cooks…
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Aw.
 Rachel: What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
 Rachel: Joey there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Now Joey what did the duck do?!
 Rachel: Hey Joey what ‘cha doing?
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: Joey did you my face cream?
 Rachel: Joey (nervously) where did you learn that word?
 Rachel: (gasps) You found my book?!
 Rachel: Joey what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
 Rachel: Hey-hey y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my book. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality which by the way you will never understand. (She goes into her room.)
 Rachel: Well what happened at dinner?
 Rachel: Wait but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a rec. center!
 Rachel: No y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. I mean you don’t have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y’know? And-and you don’t need you don’t need this custom-made empire waisted duchess satin gown; you can wear off the rack. (She starts to cry as does Monica.)
 Rachel: Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
 Rachel: Well what?! How-how much is it?!
 Rachel: Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!
 Rachel: (starting to cry) Ohh you guys are so made for each other.
 Rachel: (quietly) Joey.
 Rachel: Uh-huh I get it smoke chimney chimney sweep very funny ha-ha.
 Rachel: Well no I don’t smell anything.
 Rachel: Nothing!
 Rachel: Y’know I can not believe you told him Joey!
 Rachel: Uh-huh yeah I did because I wore out my first copy when I was with you. (Exits.)
 Rachel: Who are you supposed to be?
 Rachel: Do you even know what a vicar is?
 Rachel: (sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey it’s enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it’s—I’m not—it’s just not funny anymore!
 Rachel: All right! Y’know what? That’s it! You wanna do it?! Let’s do it!
 Rachel: (starting to move closer to him) That’s right I wanna do it with you! I’ve been trying to fight it but you just said all the right things.
 Rachel: (moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh I’ve been waitin’ so long to get on that body!
 Rachel: Yeah that’s right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
 Rachel: Oh come on now don’t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But I would keep that helmet on because you’re in for a rough ride! (He backs into the door.)
 Rachel: Yeah what?
 Rachel: Yeah-yeah did-didn’t you use to have a pair? They were really round burgundy and they made you look kind of umm…
 Rachel: Yes!
 Rachel: Oh y’know what you should get ‘em? One of those little uh portable CD players.
 Rachel: Yeah and-and-and by someone she means Joey.
 Rachel: Y’know Joey I could teach you to sail if you want.
 Rachel: Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
 Rachel: What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
 Rachel: That is the Coast Guard.
 Rachel: Joey just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with the lesson yet.
 Rachel: Okay I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time are you ready?
 Rachel: Oh okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old hot chickas? Okay let’s do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though (grabs some of the rigging) what’s this called?
 Rachel: Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
 Rachel: No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
 Rachel: Time’s up now your dead.
 Rachel: Okay you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)
 Rachel: Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
 Rachel: (laughing) Yeah and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
 Rachel: I don’t know. Y’know they didn’t get us anything.
 Rachel: Well hello! So when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey?
 Rachel: Why not?
 Rachel: What? I was just trying to teach you.
 Rachel: Excuse me I wanted you to help but you couldn’t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
 Rachel: Look Joey I’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
 Rachel: Well does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
 Rachel: Yeah I didn’t want you to get hit by the boom!
 Rachel: All right y’know what? I-I’m sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
 Rachel: I won’t boss you around.
 Rachel: And I’ll be nice.
 Rachel: And—Joey!
 Rachel: Okay Joey honey you’re doing really good! All right now I’m just gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember which side is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
 Rachel: Right?
 Rachel: It’s left sweetie but that’s okay sweetie that’s a tough one.
 Rachel: Okay go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of the boat.) The left!
 Rachel: (yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)
 Rachel: No! No-no no-no-no very quiet said with love no yelling.
 Rachel: Okay Joey we’re luffing a little bit so could you tighten up the cunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)
 Rachel: Joey come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)
 Rachel: (angrily) No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
 Rachel: What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit!
 Rachel: Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do not quit!
 Rachel: Oh my God wait did I—I just said Greens don’t quit didn’t I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens don’t quit?!
 Rachel: No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you I’m just yelling near you. Oh God Joey ohh I’m my father. Oh my God this is horrible! I’ve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh Joey I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Awww…
 Rachel: Left.
 Rachel: Well Joey I hate to admit it your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
 Rachel: Ohh we’re not sailing.
 Rachel: All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.) Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees what’s in the cooler.) Sandwiches!
 Rachel: (hands him one) Here you go.
 Rachel: Oh wow! (She takes a bite but holds the sandwich vertically so that the stuff falls out.)
 Rachel: Ohh sorry.
 Rachel: Ohh whoops.
 Rachel: That’s nice.
 Rachel: Well that was umm…Okay.
 Rachel: Ohh no you don’t! You got lighting last time lighting is mine!
 Rachel: What are you gonna do Pheebs?
 Rachel: (entering excitedly) Oh! Hi you guys oh my God! You’ll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and…
 Rachel: Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
 Rachel: Okay so anyway I’m sittin’ in my office and guess who walks in.
 Rachel: Joey!
 Rachel: Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. (To Monica and Phoebe) It was Ralph Lauren! (Monica and Phoebe gasp) Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
 Rachel: It’s the same story.
 Rachel: (ignoring him) Anyway Ralph just came in to tell me that he’s so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: I got—I get a big pay raise!
 Rachel: I get to hire my own assistant!
 Rachel: (reading the resume) And you were at this job for four years?
 Rachel: Okay well this is all very impressive Hilda um I just have one last question for you. Uh how did I do? Was this okay?
 Rachel: I’ve never interviewed anyone before. I’ve actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid we did have a maid but this is-this isn’t the same thing.
 Rachel: No. Yeah and I know that. All right well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.

 Rachel: Oh come on what are you talking about? You’ve got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday’s come on!
 Rachel: Okay hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and takes his picture.) I’m sorry it’s for human resources everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
 Rachel: Chandler you have an assistant right?
 Rachel: No I-I just don’t know how you decide who to hire. I mean I’ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy…
 Rachel: I love him. He’s so pretty I wanna cry! I don’t know what to do. Tell me what to do.
 Rachel: Uh-huh. No I hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!
 Rachel: Okay you’re right. I’ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
 Rachel: Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
 Rachel: Kinda.

 Rachel: Really? (Giggles.)
 Rachel: Yeah this is Tag. Tag this is Phoebe. Phoebe can I see you for a second? (Goes into office.)
 Rachel: (grabbing Phoebe) Okay. We’ll be right back. (They go into her office and she closes the door.)
 Rachel: All right I know I know how it looks Pheebs but I’m telling you…
 Rachel: Yes I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I’ve ever done. But I’m telling you from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. (There’s a knock on the door.) Yes?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Gay? Yeah. (Kathy leaves dejectedly.)
 Rachel: (noticing him) Hi! (Puts the pictures away.)
 Rachel: Well yeah sure what’s up?
 Rachel: Oh really?!
 Rachel: Oh did you not want people to know that?
 Rachel: Why’s that?
 Rachel: Ohh you can say. Come on I don’t want you to feel like you can’t tell me things. (Motions for him to sit down.)
 Rachel: ‘Kay.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: (Pause) Yeah she’s gay.
 Rachel: Hey look-look Phoebe’s talking to uh Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
 Rachel: Hey I thought that guy was married.
 Rachel: Phoebe if this guy’s going through a divorce is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
 Rachel: Oh I gotta get back to work.
 Rachel: Yeah but my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
 Rachel: Oh no I know that. I know that. Although we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
 Rachel: I am not gonna get fired because I’m not gonna act on it.
 Rachel: Why? Is he? He is! Isn’t he? He’s dating that slut in marketing!
 Rachel: Oh no sit-ups today Tag?
 Rachel: Oh well drop and give me ten more!
 Rachel: Uh I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
 Rachel: Oh great could you make me four copies of those?
 Rachel: (startled) Ahh hi! Hi! Melissa what’s up? I’m just uh about to umm go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y’know like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What’s up? (She has put on the backpack.)
 Rachel: No. Why?
 Rachel: Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
 Rachel: Okay whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain’t a locker room okay? But y’know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
 Rachel: Oh yeah. All right back to work.
 Rachel: Yeah Melissa I don’t want to be known as the uh office bitch but I will call your supervisor.
 Rachel: Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
 Rachel: Yeah sure. Umm…here. (Hands him one.)
 Rachel: Yeah I don’t think so Joe.
 Rachel: Hey listen umm what-what are you doing tonight?
 Rachel: How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I’ll pay.
 Rachel: I’m not asking you to go on a date with him!
 Rachel: Joey just-just he-he’s new in town and I know he doesn’t have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I’ll really appreciate it.
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Hi Tag! Hey so did you have fun with uh with Joey last night?

 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: (entering) Hi!
 Rachel: So uh heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
 Rachel: Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
 Rachel: Y’know all the women.
 Rachel: All right would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay just the idea of you and he and all these women it’s just—And I know he’s my assistant and I can’t date him—but it just bothers me all right?!
 Rachel: All right will you will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this dating tons of women thing is!
 Rachel: I just don’t want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush—And I will get over it. It’s-it’s not like I love him it’s just physical! But—I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
 Rachel: Yeah. Sure. (Joey nods his head questioningly and Rachel nods no.)
 Rachel: (To Joey) So will you talk to him?
 Rachel: Oh come on! I’ll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
 Rachel: Hi! (He hands her her mail) Thanks hey so uh what’d you do last night?

 Rachel: I’d love to!
 Rachel: (panics turns around picks up the phone and pretend to talk on it) Hello?! (Listens) Oh yeah! (To Tag) This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. (Tag leaves and she closes the door behind him disgustedly.) Yeah!
 Rachel: Oh my God! This is it! (She and Phoebe hold hands.) (To Phoebe) I really hope it’s you!
 Rachel: Me too!
 Rachel: Okay bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
 Rachel: Hypothetically!
 Rachel: Uh-hmm.
 Rachel: Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea.
 Rachel: Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now I would like to make a toast to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing (A woman at the table behind them overhears Chandler’s name and starts listening closer) my best friend and truly one of the nicest people that…
 Rachel: Fine!
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Really?!
 Rachel: Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I’m just—Wait a minute. If I’m your maid of honor that means you are Monica’s.
 Rachel: Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica’s!
 Rachel: Why does it matter so much to you?!
 Rachel: What-what if I marry Ross—Or Joey?
 Rachel: Yeah but Phoebe…
 Rachel: Okay. Okay. It’s—since you’ve never done it before you can be Monica’s made of honor.
 Rachel: I’m gonna marry someone good y’know.
 Rachel: Better than Chandler. (Phoebe exhales as if to say Like what isn’t?)
 Rachel: Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor!
 Rachel: (shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!!
 Rachel: All right that’s it! I am maid of honor!
 Rachel: How come you are?!
 Rachel: Oh come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?!
 Rachel: Okay. Okay fine y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. (Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii Ross! Sweetie.
 Rachel: Okay uh…
 Rachel: …it’s gonna be okay!
 Rachel: Look Monica getting cold feet is very common. Y’know it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.
 Rachel: Thanks!
 Rachel: Thank you judges.
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
 Rachel: Ohh wait a minute we haven’t pre…
 Rachel: Okay! Okay! Umm Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage as… (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay never mind! Forget it! Umm umm okay uh… I met I-I met I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25 although he seemed like a six year old.
 Rachel: Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm I’ve known them separately and I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holds it up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
 Rachel: Aw thanks!
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm I wonder where I’ve heard that before.)
 Rachel: No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway this was ridiculous—We’re gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the coin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)
 Rachel: Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her her vegetarian voodoo goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)
 Rachel: Hi Pheebs.
 Rachel: Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby.
 Rachel: Yeah. Yeah and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
 Rachel: Yeah! Oh umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together y’know just in case…
 Rachel: Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny look this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows Phoebe the picture.) And look she made me carry her train which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here’s a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse) Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
 Rachel: And umm vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause people cry at weddings. (Starting to cry.) I’m just gonna grab a couple of these.
 Rachel: Oh I forgot this was in here. Umm this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s blue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah…
 Rachel: You do? Why?
 Rachel: But Pheebs y’know you earned it.
 Rachel: No I was ten. I just developed early.
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Yeah okay you laugh now but she’s gonna be yours. (Phoebe gets suddenly scared.)
 Rachel: Hi! Oh how was your date last night?
 Rachel: Oh good. (She walks to the closed bathroom door opens it and finds a naked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God sorry! (She closes the door and confronts Joey.)
 Rachel: What-what?! You’re gonna leave this person with me?!
 Rachel: Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
 Rachel: Y’know what? That’s a lot to remember can’t I just tell her you’re a pig?
 Rachel: Well forget it I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: Yeah Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: (pause) Would you like some pancakes?
 Rachel: Yeah we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
 Rachel: I know!
 Rachel: Oh and I’ll call ya too!
 Rachel: Bye!
 Rachel: Oh Joey I’m sorry I just couldn’t tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y’know we got to talking and I…
 Rachel: Cupid.
 Rachel: Look Joey come on she’s so perfect for you! I mean she’s sweet she-she likes baseball and she-she had two beers at lunch.
 Rachel: Yeah maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
 Rachel: Fine. (They start to walk away.)
 Rachel: Phoebe!
 Rachel: I’m sorry?
 Rachel: Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
 Rachel: Yeah there was. It was—there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read—Yes there was.
 Rachel: Well now what’s the rush?
 Rachel: Well look who’s here!
 Rachel: Hi! Well we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe we forgot that party we have to go to.
 Rachel: (does a retching sound) Wait a minute! Why don’t you guys do something?!
 Rachel: How did it go with Erin?
 Rachel: (gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkin’ about having kids. Oh my Joey. (She goes over and hugs him.) Oh please don’t get married before I do.
 Rachel: So how’s it goin’ with Joey?
 Rachel: Okay? Wait okay tell-tell me that you like him please? I mean tell me that you like him.
 Rachel: But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
 Rachel: Ugh tramp!
 Rachel: Yeah see ya.
 Rachel: Wow. Well I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Jo-Joey look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh she’s not lookin’ for a serious relationship.
 Rachel: Well she told me. She said she’s kinda a loner.
 Rachel: Joey…
 Rachel: Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell ‘em you’re not looking for a relationship.
 Rachel: Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?
 Rachel: Do you want some pancakes?
 Rachel: All right I got 48.
 Rachel: (counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting?
 Rachel: Oh right. Sorry. But Tags not coming; his girlfriend came into town so hes spending Thanksgiving with her.
 Rachel: Well I was going to but then I figured you know... youre food is so delicious and perfect you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
 Rachel: Seriously its moving!
 Rachel: (gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
 Rachel: Well sure! Come in! (He enters) Well what-what happened to your girlfriend?
 Rachel: Oh Im sorry.
 Rachel: Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean not even puppies?
 Rachel: Oh wait before you guys go can I just ask you a question?
 Rachel: When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
 Rachel: Interesting.
 Rachel: Huh. A moo-point?
 Rachel: (to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long or did that all just make sense?
 Rachel: Youre right Im sorry. Thank you. Okay thats what Im gonna do.
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: How are you holding up?
 Rachel: Yeah? Im sorry about your girlfriend.
 Rachel: So were you guys together a long time?
 Rachel: Now that she broke up with you?
 Rachel: Yeah. Hmmmm.
 Rachel: No…Yeah all the time constantly. Its terrifying. But you know that I figure it…it has to work out.
 Rachel: Because uh—it has to.
 Rachel: Yeah I know I do. I really do.
 Rachel: Well what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug)
 Rachel: Uh yeah well see he… Joey knows that Im-Im very insecure about my back and and…youre hugging me so obviously you are not repulsed by it yeah!
 Rachel: No? (He shakes his head) All right heres the truth um Joey said what he said because um Im attracted to you.
 Rachel: Yeah I admit it. I have a crush on you and uh and and I know thats crazy because we work together and-and nothing could ever happen and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Okay thats gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
 Rachel: (she hurries after him) Wait we still have time to talk and they’re-theyre not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh look there they go okay. (She hurries in too)
 Rachel: Yeah ohh! Why damnit why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee I-I know that I freaked him out
 Rachel: (gasps) Hi!
 Rachel: (uncovers the dog) Hi!
 Rachel: Oh hi! How are you doing?
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Look um I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
 Rachel: Ah I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? It just doesnt matter how I feel. I mean we work together so nothing could really ever happen between us and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday and-and never talk about this again okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So were okay?
 Rachel: Oh god I know it that I freaked you out.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Okay well thats one less thing we have to do on Monday.
 Rachel: (entering happily) Gooood morning!!
 Rachel: Well why shouldn’t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
 Rachel: Come on it’s not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
 Rachel: (pauses as she thinks and exhales loudly) We… We are not… …going to let it… be a problem.
 Rachel: Well y’know we did other stuff too. (Joey and Chandler start to giggle.)
 Rachel: Oh Monica come on y’know I don’t sleep with guys on the first date!
 Rachel: Anymore!!
 Rachel: Hi. Tag I have a conference call today is that correct?
 Rachel: Okay thank you. That’ll be all. (The mail guy leaves and Tag starts to follow but Rachel stops him.) (Excitedly) Wait! Wait! (Rushes over and closes the office-door.) Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us. (They kiss.)
 Rachel: Okay you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in your evaluation.
 Rachel: Well you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y’know there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate. (She turns around and sweeps the stuff off of her desk and hops up onto it.)
 Rachel: No I’ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
 Rachel: (hugging him) So did you read your evaluation yet?
 Rachel: (worried) Okay please you’re kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
 Rachel: I’m thinkin’ no.
 Rachel: Umm I said I thought you were a good kisser and uh and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
 Rachel: Well it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote Yes he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision and under Problems with Performance I wrote Dear God I hope not and then uh then I drew a little smiley face and then a small pornographic sketch.
 Rachel: Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know maybe they didn’t take it the way I meant it.
 Rachel: Ugh I just gotta get the thing back!
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Oh my God! Joey!
 Rachel: Ugh!
 Rachel: Okay I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it but we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office. Now he doesn’t get in until 10 so he’s no problem but his assistant Betty she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
 Rachel: Yeah well Betty’s kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. (Holding up the box of chocolates.) Now while I distract her you get in the office.
 Rachel: Let’s roll!
 Rachel: (worried and shocked) Yeah sure Mr. Zelner for you anything—minute. Okay. Fine. (To Tag) Abort the plan abort the plan. (She start to usher Tag out.)
 Rachel: Okay. Uh well can we can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates? (Holds up the box.)
 Rachel: (laughs) Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean (getting serious) what would happen exactly.
 Rachel: Well…
 Rachel: Oh no-no-no…
 Rachel: You’re lookin’ at it upside down—y’know what? (Grabs the evaluation and throws it out.) It doesn’t matter.
 Rachel: Whoa! I can’t believe you did that. That was really sweet.
 Rachel: No you could’ve lost your job.
 Rachel: Thank you! You’re great! (They kiss.)
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: I… It just—it took me so long to get that desk organized.
 Rachel: (looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)
 Rachel: (freaking out) Oh my god!!
 Rachel: You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
 Rachel: (to Monica) Did you know he was in there?
 Rachel: (entering) Hey!
 Rachel: Drums?
 Rachel: (stopping at Phoebe’s entrance) Ha!
 Rachel: Joey y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
 Rachel: What are you talking about? I love them! (Looks into the cage) Yeah I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died because my cat ate it. And then then my cat died. But Joey isnt this cool?
 Rachel: Oh isnt that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
 Rachel: What? Wait-wait a minute what? Phoebe whats the matter?
 Rachel: And that makes you angry because…
 Rachel: Where did you get that?
 Rachel: Phoebe?
 Rachel: Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey if you wanted to do that you might as well just gotten him a fish you know how fish freaked me out!
 Rachel: It wouldnt have mattered anyway Phoebe you and I are are gonna live together were roommates; thats the deal.
 Rachel: Oh its so much more fun with you.
 Rachel: We did!
 Rachel: Oh I would love to!
 Rachel: Good good good good good. (She runs to the drums and gets the sticks)
 Rachel: (with the sticks in her hands) Um... (She goes to the tarantula-cage and puts the sticks into it) Done!
 Rachel: Oh wow! Look at this place!
 Rachel: (yelling from another room) Oh my God!
 Rachel: (returning) Okay remember uh remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
 Rachel: And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
 Rachel: Do you really not know where I’m going with this? (Phoebe nods No.) It left! It’s one huge room!
 Rachel: See?
 Rachel: You can’t because of the new skylight!
 Rachel: So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
 Rachel: Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we?
 Rachel: Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
 Rachel: Phoebe it’s okay. I like living with Joey.
 Rachel: Oh please I hate packing it’s closer to work and we do have fun. Although I’m really gonna miss living with you.
 Rachel: I know. (They hug.) Oh-oh wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
 Rachel: (entering with Phoebe) Hey!
 Rachel: (seeing the collection of characters.) Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny’s funeral in here.
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: I got it!
 Rachel: Its back in cage!
 Rachel: Joey would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
 Rachel: (freaking out) Oh my god!!
 Rachel: You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.

 Rachel: Oh I don’t-I don’t know.
 Rachel: Yeah actually I think we’re gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
 Rachel: Uh Pheebs we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
 Rachel: Oh. (They leave leaving just Joey and Ross.)
 Rachel: You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable.
 Rachel: Okay. (They start to head for the bedroom) Oh wait! Umm did you send those contracts to Milan?
 Rachel: No seriously y’know the contracts I gave you did you overnight them?
 Rachel: Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don’t get.
 Rachel: Y’know like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? (He starts laughing.) Tag! I’m serious! This isn’t funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
 Rachel: Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said Must go out today and underlined today three times and and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn’t want to seem to bossy.
 Rachel: Y’know what Tag if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
 Rachel: Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
 Rachel: No! Come on its late we’re not gonna go down to the office.
 Rachel: Okay get your coat! (They get their coats and start to leave. Rachel suddenly stops and sticks the hand up the back of her shirt.) Oh! When did you unhook this? (Her bra.) Nice work!
 Rachel: Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess Tag! I mean this is what I’m talking about! You have to be organized! You’ve got newspapers! You’ve got magazines! You got—Ohh! (Finds a picture.) And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag but whatever.
 Rachel: Okay very cute braces. Anyway y’know what the point is Tag start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk. (She goes into her office.)
 Rachel: In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk and then I put a Post-It on it (Looks down onto her desk and finds the folder with the Post-It on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave Tag) that said Must go out today. So you just keep looking in there! All right?
 Rachel: Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um check the copy room maybe you left the contracts in there?
 Rachel: I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It’s not a perfect world! Just go please.
 Rachel: Thank you. (He leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottom drawer. She then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) Hello? (Hangs up the phone.) I still don’t get it.
 Rachel: Hi! I got you some coffee. To uh… (She looks for a place to set it on his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.) …fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
 Rachel: Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
 Rachel: Well yeah I wish that you would. (He opens the top drawer.) Well no it’s not in there! (Closes it.) How about that drawer? (She points to the bottom one and he opens it. She doesn’t see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)
 Rachel: (thinks) Y’know I don’t-I don’t know. Let me let me check. (As she heads for her office she stops glances over her should at Tag looks into her office and finds the folder on her desk.)
 Rachel: Can I see you in my office for a minute?
 Rachel: You put these on my desk!
 Rachel: Oh really? So you’re saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer crawled across the floor then jumped on to my desk?! (I think Dogbert should have a line here.)
 Rachel: (pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) I am so hot for you right now.
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Well y’know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
 Rachel: So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
 Rachel: And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
 Rachel: No?
 Rachel: I’m sorry Rosita? As in…
 Rachel: Joey it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal?
 Rachel: Stevie the TV?
 Rachel: No! (Joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.) Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita us chichas got to stick together! (She tries pulling on the back of the chair until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.) You bitch!
 Rachel: Joey Joey I am so sorry.
 Rachel: Okay come on—Joey I’ll buy you a new one! All right? We’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair.
 Rachel: But don’t you think Rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? I mean y’know she did always put…your comfort first.
 Rachel: (grabbing her coat) Okay? You ready?
 Rachel: You will like it!
 Rachel: You don’t even know!
 Rachel: Well look if you don’t like this…(The audience’s laughter at Chandler’s progress cuts out the rest of Rachel’s line.)
 Rachel: Come on Joey I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey y’know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
 Rachel: Joey the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y’know start the heeling process?
 Rachel: That’s weird.
 Rachel: It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure there’s some explanation.
 Rachel: Joey I really don’t…
 Rachel: Well no.
 Rachel: No y’know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
 Rachel: That’s right Joey the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. (She sits down in the chair.)
 Rachel: (grabbing a beer out of the chair’s fridge) I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
 Rachel: Hey how’s…how’s the uh miracle chair?
 Rachel: Yeah? Wow! Y’know that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
 Rachel: Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
 Rachel: Hey Chandler!
 Rachel: How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines has a rolling massage and speakers in the head rest?
 Rachel: Well what if I told you you can do it in my apartment?
 Rachel: I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000. (Which is an actual product by the way I’m not sure about the 3000 part.)
 Rachel: Well it’s a long story but umm I broke Joey’s chair…
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Ohhhhh. That’s how it got fixed!
 Rachel: Noo! (Laughs) Angels.
 Rachel: What? Wh-hey!
 Rachel: Yeah he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
 Rachel: No Joe no miracle.
 Rachel: Uh-huh! Nice try but you don’t get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! (Joey starts to get up.) No I take that back!
 Rachel: No-no-no! This chair’s not going anywhere.
 Rachel: The logic is that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
 Rachel: We’re the Cobras!
 Rachel: Ahhhh….
 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Oh yeah Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
 Rachel: Good ones?
 Rachel: Well can I keep the presents and still be 29?
 Rachel: Y’know I’m still 29 in Guam.
 Rachel: Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
 Rachel: Look y’know I know my life’s going pretty well but I look around and I just see so many people who’ve accomplished so many other goals by the time they’re thirty.
 Rachel: There you go!
 Rachel: Thirty. Ugh I mean thirty! Monica do you remember mean old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
 Rachel: Nothing. I don’t want to do anything.
 Rachel: Really! God Ross what were you thinking? (To Phoebe quietly) I know it’s really shallow but a part of me wants him again.
 Rachel: Y’know what? I am going to do something today. I’m not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I’m gonna get something pierced. Like my uh like my nose or my tongue or something.
 Rachel: So what?! Y’know what? The way I see it—(Phoebe pulls out a hair from the back of her head)—Ow! Son of a bitch!!
 Rachel: (glares at him) Get out get out of my apartment.
 Rachel: (entering) Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She’s coming!
 Rachel: What’s-what’s going on? Phil’s really pissed!
 Rachel: Okay but taking care of a drunk naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
 Rachel: Ahh!
 Rachel: (opening it) A scooter! (She’s not happy.)
 Rachel: No! No-no I love it. Thank you. (Kisses him.)
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Okay. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday Grandma! It’s better to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down as everyone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying) That’s funny yeah!
 Rachel: (crying) No I know! I get it! It’s funny!
 Rachel: No I know because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things. That’s why it’s so funny. (Runs into her room crying.)
 Rachel: Well I feel fine but I think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids.
 Rachel: Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids…
 Rachel: As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
 Rachel: So if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35 I don’t have to get pregnant until I’m 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant…
 Rachel: No so I don’t have to get married until I’m 33! That’s three years that’s three whole years—Oh wait a minute though. I’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding and I’d like to know the guy for a year year and a half before we get engaged… Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I’m thirty.
 Rachel: No! Ross no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
 Rachel: (To Chandler) I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
 Rachel: Hey. (After she leaves.) Oh poor Pheebs.
 Rachel: Ross I really don’t think…
 Rachel: Hey Joey can I…
 Rachel: Actually I just wanna talk to Tag.
 Rachel: Whatever! Okay I’m not your mother.
 Rachel: Not in the street!!
 Rachel: (to Tag) Hi.
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Yeah I’m doing okay. I’m um…let’s talk.
 Rachel: Umm…
 Rachel: Ohh Tag umm…you’re such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don’t-I don’t…
 Rachel: Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh but I just think I’m past the point where I think I can y’know just have fun.
 Rachel: Yeah it is! But you’re just a kid! I mean you’re 25!
 Rachel: Oh God! Y’know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually if I’m wishin’ for stuff I actually wish I was six years younger.
 Rachel: Yeah I’m sorry. (They hug.)
 Rachel: Oh if I only want two kids can I keep him for another year?
 Rachel: (starting to cry) Ohh…
 Rachel: Yeah it’s just y’know…
 Rachel: Oh! I would love to read a poem.
 Rachel: (crying) It’ll be a short one.
 Rachel: Ohhh…
 Rachel: Wait what do you mean you’re getting a new brain?
 Rachel: She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces I mean I don’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage.
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Cecilia Monroe man what a great actress.
 Rachel: (They both look behind them.) Well Id have to say gay.
 Rachel: Well mainly because hes kissing that other guy.
 Rachel: Oh yeah hes too cute to be straight.
 Rachel: All right straight and not subtle. (The man gets up and leaves.)
 Rachel: Oh well we can hand it to Gunther and hell put it in lost and found.
 Rachel: What if um if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldnt that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
 Rachel: What? Wait! Why…why do you get the story?
 Rachel: Phoebe you had a date three days ago.
 Rachel: Okay. Okay see? I get the phone.
 Rachel: Yeah! (Breaking up) And until now I didn’t think I’d love again.
 Rachel: Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
 Rachel: Well umm maybe we could uhh… (Grabs the phone) Ah-ha! Too slow!!
 Rachel: No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okay look I have an idea. Why don’t we why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
 Rachel: I don’t think so.
 Rachel: (checking the speed dial) All right first name on the speed dial is mom.
 Rachel: Okay no way you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
 Rachel: Yes okay. (Checking the speed dial again.) Well now see this isn’t telling us anything. (Reading the speed dial) Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat’s a steak house!
 Rachel: (looking at the speed dial) Oh I win! He’s got Barney’s on his speed dial.
 Rachel: (showing Phoebe her phone) His new girlfriend!
 Rachel: Hi Pheebs!
 Rachel: How are ya?
 Rachel: Umm Pheebs remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh the cute guy’s cell phone?
 Rachel: And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
 Rachel: And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
 Rachel: You stole the phone!
 Rachel: No? So you’re saying that if I called it it wouldn’t ring?
 Rachel: Umm okay. But while you dial let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. (Rachel dials her phone and Phoebe’s bag starts to ring.) Oh it does work! (Rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of Phoebe’s handbag.)
 Rachel: Phoebe!
 Rachel: Oh is it?! (She answers the cute guy’s phone.) Uhh hello? (On her phone) Yes hi is Rachel there? (On the other phone) Yes she is just one moment please. (To Phoebe holding out both phones.) It’s for me!
 Rachel: Oh my God! I bet that’s him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh (In a sexy voice) Hello? Or should I be (Happily) Hi! It’s Rach… (Phoebe knocks the phone out of Rachel’s hand catches it and answers it.) Would you stop doing that?!
 Rachel: Phoebe! You can’t do th…
 Rachel: You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
 Rachel: You just said it!
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe!
 Rachel: Ohh! (Exits.)
 Rachel: Hey! Hey!
 Rachel: Well why shouldn’t I?!
 Rachel: Well then I get to give him the cell phone.
 Rachel: (laughs) You’re not the man who left the cell phone.
 Rachel: Is-is he coming? (Looks hopefully out the door.)
 Rachel: We’ll be right back sir.
 Rachel: I don’t know!

 Rachel: Oh you’re one of those. But y’know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
 Rachel: Well y’know we would umm repeat everything the other said or uh we’d jump out of closets to scare each other or switch the sugar for the salt so they’d put salt on their cereal.
 Rachel: Yeah? You like that one?
 Rachel: I’m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey I’ve got a ton of these! Umm oh hear—Do you want a good one? Here’s a good one. Umm you uh you take a quarter take a quarter and and you blacken the edge. Right? (Does so.) And then you say to person I bet you can’t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it they’re left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
 Rachel: Yeah I-I-I-I’m funny Ben but I’m not stupid. Okay?
 Rachel: Coming.
 Rachel: Uh-oh.
 Rachel: Oh yeah? Did he pull the old… (She is waving her hand up and down her face. She’s thinking about the pencil mark.)
 Rachel: Oh that.
 Rachel: Oh come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat you don’t think that’s just a little funny?!
 Rachel: (looking at his mark) Yes.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Well y’know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself What’s up with Carol and sweet little Ben?
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: I’d love that. I would loooove… (Carol goes to make the coffee and she sits down.) So uh so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
 Rachel: I found him! (To Ben) Very funny come here! (She sits down on the coffee table and Ben walks up.) That is exactly why I’ve come here to talk to you okay?
 Rachel: Yes oh—(To Ben)—Do I want sugar in my coffee? (Ben nods no.) No just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. (To Ben) Okay do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
 Rachel: Don’t do that.
 Rachel: Seriously your dad doesn’t like pranks.
 Rachel: Oh damnit!
 Rachel: No! Don’t say that! Don’t say that!
 Rachel: No don’t! Go back to repeating!
 Rachel: Oh crap!
 Rachel: So now what have we agreed?
 Rachel: And-and what else?

 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Carol…Lesbian?
 Rachel: What line?
 Rachel: All right I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already!
 Rachel: Okay maybe they are not funny to you…
 Rachel: Or Carol! But they’re funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
 Rachel: That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout I will be revenged?!
 Rachel: Fine. Fine but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!
 Rachel: Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!
 Rachel: I gotta go! (Runs out.)
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun don’t we Ben? (He nods yes.)
 Rachel: Ohh okay. (Ross has a sign on his back that reads ‘Poop.’) Wh—Ah-ha! (Ross stops and turns.) Wait a minute. Uh Ben I can’t do it.
 Rachel: I can’t let him go out that way he’s got a meeting. (To Ross) You’ve got something here on your back.
 Rachel: Oh I…
 Rachel: No! Wait! Come on!
 Rachel: No you guys… (She walks out into the hallway.)
 Rachel: EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! (She runs over to him and finds that it was a dummy and that she had been had.)
 Rachel: Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
 Rachel: I do the same thing.
 Rachel: I’m just kidding too. (Laughs) I’m getting married in December. (Turns away not happy with herself.)
 Rachel: Oh y’know what? Y’know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman’s and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
 Rachel: So does this (The dress) come in another color or… (The store owner walks away.)
 Rachel: (To Phoebe) So this is Brooklyn.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Oh they’re pushing! They’re pushing!!
 Rachel: Well I…

 Rachel: No! You gotta hold my hand!!
 Rachel: (seeing who’s trapped) Hey…
 Rachel: You’re out of Diet Coke.
 Rachel: You’re out of toilet paper!
 Rachel: Yeah I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh two months later the couple got divorced. And now I’m not saying that there’s any connection here y’know but they did tell me that’s why they got divorced.
 Rachel: Well what is the other reason?
 Rachel: Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid.
 Rachel: (gasps) Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
 Rachel: Oh stop that! Don’t kid about that! (Gasps) Will all the stars be there?
 Rachel: Oh my God! Oh my God! I can’t go! I’m gonna be too nervous!
 Rachel: No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.

 Rachel: So you’ll definitely get onstage even if you don’t win.
 Rachel: Well of course I do! But y’know favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you’re up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
 Rachel: Well Joey you’ll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y’know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y’know? So it’s sorta like… (Does it you’ll have to see it.)
 Rachel: Y’know?
 Rachel: Oh no at the Grammies I always win.
 Rachel: (entering from her room) Whoa what?
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Not right now.
 Rachel: Oh see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in love.

 Rachel: Do you really want an award you didn’t win?
 Rachel: Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
 Rachel: Joey no this is wrong! You have to take it back okay? You don’t want to win an award this way. You’re very talented. And someday you’re gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.

 Rachel: (calmly) Okay. I’m sorry. You’re right you’re right.
 Rachel: Phoebe I already I already did.

 Rachel: (pause) What?
 Rachel: Okay. Okay. All right you take care of that. And meanwhile the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list.
 Rachel: Hey! What’s up Mon?
 Rachel: Have at it.
 Rachel: Are you makin’ him a sandwich?
 Rachel: (To Phoebe after Monica’s gone) We have to get her a present?!
 Rachel: Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Well I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
 Rachel: (to her) Hi! I’m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I’m the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
 Rachel: Ohhhh!
 Rachel: That’s great!
 Rachel: (to the woman) Excuse us for a minute. (They go into the kitchen.) You didn’t tell her to come?!
 Rachel: No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
 Rachel: Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
 Rachel: Oh Monica we are so sorry.
 Rachel: Well first for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
 Rachel: Yeah we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower and now you don’t have either.
 Rachel: Ugh…
 Rachel: What do you what do you mean?
 Rachel: Surprise…
 Rachel: …Monica.
 Rachel: Hey! Out of all of us who do you think is gonna get married next?
 Rachel: (to the gang) Oh my God Melissa Warburton. I don’t think I have the energy for this.
 Rachel: (screaming) Melissa!
 Rachel: Wh—(Turns and looks at the gang who’s staring)—Why don’t I tell you over here? (She walks Melissa away from the gang.)
 Rachel: Oh no-no no! It’s good! It’s all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
 Rachel: I will not! I’m the divisional head of men’s sportswear!
 Rachel: Oh please…
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: Oh tomorrow oh I don’t know. Um…
 Rachel: Shut up.
 Rachel: Oh wow thanks! (Reading the card) Oh you’re in real estate!
 Rachel: Wow! What do you do now?
 Rachel: Okay! (Joins the rest of the gang.)
 Rachel: Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
 Rachel: She’s actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
 Rachel: (To Monica) Yes.
 Rachel: It’s not a big deal!
 Rachel: No we weren’t! It was nothing! It was one night senior year we went to a party had a lot of sangria and y’know ended up…kissing for a bit.
 Rachel: Oh wow. Why don’t we just take me (Grabs her pin) and put me with a Manhattan in my hand talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs. Monica just glares at her.) These pins aren’t for playing are they?
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Stop picturing it!!
 Rachel: That is not a problem.
 Rachel: Oh get out of here! (Jumps back and walks away.)
 Rachel: (motioning to a rack) So now these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there’s anything that you like we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a few) But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
 Rachel: I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me!
 Rachel: Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they’re done with them they just send ‘em back.
 Rachel: Some of them.
 Rachel: Honey might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
 Rachel: Umm well let’s see uh this one is Tom Brokaw.
 Rachel: (reading a tag) This one is uh Paul O’Neil.
 Rachel: He plays for the Yankees. Seriously ESPN! Just once and a while have it on in the background. (Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux) Ooh this one was Pierce Brosnan!
 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: It’s a pretty cool tux.
 Rachel: (entering) Hey!
 Rachel: So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding do you need one?
 Rachel: Well what are you going to wear?
 Rachel: Huh. Does Monica know about this?
 Rachel: Can I please be there when you tell her? (Joey nods yes.)
 Rachel: Oh y’know what? I can’t. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
 Rachel: Well do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey’s lewd version?
 Rachel: Hey come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time…she and I y’know…kissed a little bit.
 Rachel: It-it did!
 Rachel: Yeah it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
 Rachel: Yeah why is it so hard for you to believe?!
 Rachel: I’m not saying that I’m a lesbian! I’m just saying that this happened!
 Rachel: (shocked) Vanilla?!
 Rachel: I’m not vanilla! I’ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
 Rachel: All right y’know what? If you don’t want to believe me about this why don’t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
 Rachel: Oh. Oh that’s great!
 Rachel: (changing the subject) Anyway speaking of drinking too much. I was uh tellin’ Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh we made out.
 Rachel: Remember?! We—come on both had the sarongs on and we had the-the coconut bikini tops…
 Rachel: …we went back the house and we got really silly and we…we made out.
 Rachel: How can you not remember us kissing?!
 Rachel: Wh… Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn’t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin’ together?
 Rachel: Yeah—but come on—Listen I’m sorry I don’t want to make you uncomfortable but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn’t believe me.
 Rachel: No!!
 Rachel: Thank you Phoebe.
 Rachel: It happened! I am telling you it happened!
 Rachel: What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! (She does so.) Okay? Look that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life and I’m not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay so if you don’t remember that maybe you will remember this! (She grabs Melissa and kisses her on the lips.)
 Rachel: (shocked) What?
 Rachel: (moving away) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
 Rachel: (moves away again) I-I-I-I’m just…I’m just a good kisser!
 Rachel: I’m sorry!
 Rachel: Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna…
 Rachel: What the hell was that?!
 Rachel: And?
 Rachel: Well y’know what they say the 23rd time’s the charm. (Chandler enters.) Aww look at you all handsome!
 Rachel: Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
 Rachel: I don’t want to say.
 Rachel: Diane Keeton.
 Rachel: Monica what?
 Rachel: What is the emergency?!
 Rachel: Well I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
 Rachel: Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm maybe you can start with Chandler even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more.
 Rachel: Well y’know sometimes that helps. (She realises what that could’ve meant.)
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Hey what have you guys been up to?
 Rachel: I can’t believe they’ve been together for three years.
 Rachel: I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us.
 Rachel: Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: OH MY GOD!!!
 Rachel: Phoebe!! Phoebe!! Its okay!! Its okay!!
 Rachel: I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
 Rachel: Yes I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesnt know so you have to stop screaming!!

 Rachel: Nothing! Oh God were just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
 Rachel: All right honey wed better go if we wanna catch that movie.
 Rachel: Are you kidding?!
 Rachel: I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey do they know that we know?
 Rachel: Joey!
 Rachel: Ugh I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
 Rachel: Joey look just look at it this way the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
 Rachel: Okay!
 Rachel: You really think it would be that different?
 Rachel: Well things change.
 Rachel: Hey whos this little naked guy?
 Rachel: Aww look at the little thing.
 Rachel: Wow Monica you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
 Rachel: Well we were just talkin’ about you guys gettin’ married and how great it is.
 Rachel: Oh can we read them?
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: (To Monica) Monica will-will you marry me?
 Rachel: Wait a minute! (To Monica) You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you you say you’re the only one who’s allowed to drive it.
 Rachel: (shocked) You let Joey drive it?!
 Rachel: Wow! I can’t believe you lied to me.
 Rachel: Take the top down did ya?
 Rachel: Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she’s talking about! I am an excellent driver!
 Rachel: Well in High School that added up to head cheerleader.
 Rachel: I think she’s checking out your beehive Ross.
 Rachel: Gimme the keys!
 Rachel: Well no brush!
 Rachel: (to the woman) Alimony. (Runs outside.)
 Rachel: Ahhh! (Gets in.) Ooh nice!
 Rachel: My God!
 Rachel: Just washing the windshield. (She turns on the wipers forcing Ross off of the hood.)
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Look Ross if you’re so freaked out just get in the car!
 Rachel: All right. (She starts off.)
 Rachel: What are you doing?! Get in the front!
 Rachel: Oh my…
 Rachel: God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
 Rachel: Oh Ross you’re so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax… (She takes her hands off of the wheel.)
 Rachel: I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
 Rachel: Uh-oh. (She starts to pull over.)
 Rachel: Really? You think so?
 Rachel: Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I’ll go under you go over!
 Rachel: Oh come on Ross!! (She tries to switch places with him and goes under his leg.)
 Rachel: (sexily) Hi officer was I going a little too fast?
 Rachel: Oh yes absolutely! Y’know it’s weird uh but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh…well I probably shouldn’t tell you the rest.
 Rachel: (handing it to him) Yes. Here you go Officer uh Handsome.
 Rachel: Oops sorry my mistake.
 Rachel: Really?! You think so? Y’know I had just rolled out of bed.
 Rachel: Y’know you’re-you’re probably wondering about the old date on there.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: I bet you’re a Gemini.
 Rachel: Taurus?
 Rachel: Virgo?
 Rachel: Sagittarius?
 Rachel: I knew it! I knew it ahh….
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: I won’t speed.
 Rachel: I promise.
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Oh well…
 Rachel: Remind me to introduce you to someone!
 Rachel: Fourth gear!!
 Rachel: Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o’clock position.
 Rachel: It’s a different guy!
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: (pause) You have a son!
 Rachel: (checking her watch) Op! We gotta go! (The girls stand up.)
 Rachel: What ‘cha doing Mon?
 Rachel: Hey! Those are all the things I’m responsible for!
 Rachel: The commercial?
 Rachel: Oh that’s great!
 Rachel: Oh wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II not World War I.
 Rachel: You’re gonna be late! Go! Go! (He runs out.)
 Rachel: Mexico?
 Rachel: Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
 Rachel: Yeah! But I don’t know what he looks like!
 Rachel: Man in the black dress… (Monica walks away and Rachel looks around to find a woman in a black dress.) (To her) Hi! I’m Rachel! I’m a friend of Monica and Chandler’s!
 Rachel: Oh I get it! A…man…duh!
 Rachel: I’ll do it.
 Rachel: I said I’ll do it!
 Rachel: Monica! I’m not gonna screw it up!
 Rachel: Well of course that is what I’m here for!
 Rachel: Ugh! (To Phoebe) What grandmother?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: She’s steaming her dress why? What’s up?
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: (reading the note) Tell Monica I’m sorry.
 Rachel: Yeah but maybe it’s not what we think. Maybe it’s tell Monica I’m sorry I…drank the last of the milk.
 Rachel: Okay. Phoebe I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: (closing the door) Ross said there’s still no word from Chandler.
 Rachel: Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
 Rachel: God! Don’t—We can’t let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God but wait she’ll be in the gown and then he won’t show up and then she’s gonna have to take off the gown…
 Rachel: I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It’s just…It’s just so sad!
 Rachel: I know. I know. Oh God. (Looking around) There’s no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Oh thank you! (Wiping her nose.) Oh God! (She throws it out.) Can I have another one?
 Rachel: Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn’t show up!
 Rachel: Oh I mean she’s gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering Oh that poor girl. Y’know? Then she’ll have to come back here and live all alone.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: No she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
 Rachel: Okay Phoebe we can not tell anyone about this.
 Rachel: Okay?
 Rachel: No. Why?
 Rachel: Anything?
 Rachel: All right we’ve got to tell her he’s gone. (Starts to leave.)
 Rachel: Ross she’s gonna start getting ready soon!
 Rachel: All right well how much time do you need?
 Rachel: One hour.
 Rachel: Then why do you ask?!
 Rachel: All right I’ll see you guys later.
 Rachel: I’ll figure something out.
 Rachel: Thanks.
 Rachel: Okay uh but before you do that. I-I I need you to talk to me.
 Rachel: Umm… I’m never gonna getting married!
 Rachel: No Monica! I’m serious! Oh maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
 Rachel: Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
 Rachel: The nights are the hardest. (Checks her watch.) But then the day comes! And that’s every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again…
 Rachel: I know. At dusk. That’s such a hard time for me.
 Rachel: Okay. But wait!
 Rachel: Let’s go to lunch.
 Rachel: Right.
 Rachel: Oh good God! I’ve fallen down! (She trips and falls.)
 Rachel: Okay. All right. (Gets up.) Honey listen. When I tell you what I’m about to tell you I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
 Rachel: We can’t find Chandler…(Phoebe sticks her head and motions that they found Chandler)—‘s vest. We can’t find Chandler’s vest.
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: You look so beautiful.
 Rachel: Hello?
 Rachel: Yeah we got him back. Everything’s fine.
 Rachel: What? Why? Where are you?
 Rachel: Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
 Rachel: Oh my God! I’m gonna have to find another minister.
 Rachel: Ugh! Joey I have to go.
 Rachel: Well Phoebe we gotta do something! (They turn the corner.) Well y’know. I mean there’s no way Joey’s gonna make it in time. So I’m gonna through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding excellent! {It’s a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me they were written on a sign.}(The happy couple emerges.) Congratulations. (To the best man and maid of honor) Mazel Tov! (The rabbi emerges.) Hi! Oh great hat. (He’s wearing an interesting hat and she takes him over to talk.) Listen umm I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
 Rachel: Yeah! Yeah. They’re…they’re-they’re my friends uh Monica Stephanopolus and uh and Chandler Acidofolus.
 Rachel: (leaning in) As are you…
 Rachel: Go on! Go on. (She turns back to Chandler.)
 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: Oh my God who is it?! (Phoebe rolls her eyes.)
 Rachel: For you. (Chandler leaves.)
 Rachel: Oh thank you for doing that. I just can’t deal with this just quite yet.
 Rachel: You said that she was I just didn’t disagree with you.
 Rachel: Oh yeah.
 Rachel: Oh! (They smile and the picture is taken.) Oh by the way?
 Rachel: James Brolin?
 Rachel: Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: No!
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: Ugh! Look honey y’know what? I haven’t told him yet so until I do I don’t think I should tell anybody else.
 Rachel: Phoebe!!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Honey stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
 Rachel: Oh y’know what honey? Let’s not talk about that right now?
 Rachel: Sure but come on as big as your wedding?
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Hey! Y’know sometimes you can do everything right everyone can wear everything they’re supposed to wear and one of those little guys just gets through!
 Rachel: I don’t know! Maybe they have tools.
 Rachel: Well maybe that’s maybe that’s really brave.
 Rachel: Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well.
 Rachel: (starting to cry) I don’t know.
 Rachel: Uh-hmm. I’m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
 Rachel: Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass takes a sip and realizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass without Monica noticing. It doesn’t work.) Oh that’s-that’s actually how the French drink it.
 Rachel: I don’t know. I don’t know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don’t want to make. (Takes another sip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!!
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: How many ways are there to do that?
 Rachel: All right I’ll-I’ll take it again when I get home.
 Rachel: Okay. Thank you.
 Rachel: Oh you guys are so great.
 Rachel: Wh—Hey I just gave you peeing on a stick.
 Rachel: How much longer?
 Rachel: 30 seconds okay.
 Rachel: Oh I know. I know. (They hug.)
 Rachel: Oh wait! Y’know what? I can’t I can’t look at it. I can’t. Somebody else tell me somebody tell me.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! (Pause) That is—that’s great—that is really great-great news. (Pause) Y’know ‘cause the whole not being ready and kinda the financial aspects all that. Whew. Wow this is so just the way it was supposed to be. (Starts to cry.) God.
 Rachel: Thanks. (Crying) God this is so stupid! (Pause) How could I be upset over something I never had? It’s negative?
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Are you sure?
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Oh-oh that’s a risky little game!
 Rachel: Yeah. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby! (They all hug.)
 Rachel: Ah it’s still not the time.
 Rachel: Listen y’know what sir? For the last time I don’t care what the computer says we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!
 Rachel: Are you joking? Check out is not ‘til noon and he has a good (checks her watch) eleven minutes left.
 Rachel: Yeah one time when we were dating uh we got a late checkout he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y’know he screamed out Radisson at the end.
 Rachel: (entering) Hi.
 Rachel: Shh-shh-shh! The guys don’t know yet do they?
 Rachel: Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today.
 Rachel: Ew! No!
 Rachel: Well then you have his baby.
 Rachel: Yeah. Uh-huh I guess it is pretty big news.
 Rachel: Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean I’m not gonna ask him for anything.
 Rachel: Hey Joey what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?
 Rachel: Oh Joey! Joey! No it’s not you! You didn’t get anybody pregnant!
 Rachel: Not yet.
 Rachel: No! Phoebe it’s not Gunther.
 Rachel: Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven’t told him yet and I don’t think I can tell him at all now!
 Rachel: I don’t know let me think. I was walking down the street thinking ‘I’m gonna tell the father today’ and then bam!
 Rachel: No you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!
 Rachel: I know but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn’t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.
 Rachel: What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe how do you even know who the father is?
 Rachel: Oh God… Oh he’s in there right now?
 Rachel: Uh let’s rip!
 Rachel: Oh Phoebe!
 Rachel: Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y’know you do wear that sweater a lot are you involved in some kind of dare?
 Rachel: Oh it’s just not the right time.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Tag…
 Rachel: I’m having a baby.
 Rachel: You can go.
 Rachel: Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
 Rachel: Oh wow you didn’t even try to unhook my bra!
 Rachel: No I will. I’m just not up for it tonight.
 Rachel: I’m not?
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: No! Joey oh you’re so sweet. You’re so-so sweet honey. But I’m not I’m not looking for a husband.
 Rachel: Now if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. (Exits.)
 Rachel: (entering) Oh good you’re still here!
 Rachel: I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon! (Hugs Monica.)
 Rachel: And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. (They all look at her expectantly) What? What? What?
 Rachel: How?! How do you know?
 Rachel: Oh I so wanted Ross to know first but I’m so relieved you guys know.
 Rachel: I know! (They hug.)
 Rachel: (breaking the hug) You’re all gonna be aunts and uncles.
 Rachel: Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I’m gonna tell Ross!
 Rachel: Well I was gonna tell him that I’m-I’m gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
 Rachel: Yeah but how do I start? I mean what’s-what’s the first thing that I say? (They all pause to think.) Okay great! Thanks. (She starts to leave.)
 Rachel: (seeing him) Hi!
 Rachel: Hi. (He helps her up.) Umm I think there’s something that we really need to talk about.
 Rachel: You do?

 Rachel: (confused) What?
 Rachel: Seriously. What?!
 Rachel: Okay y’know what? Can I can I talk now?
 Rachel: (touches his knee) I’m pregnant. (Ross stops.) Ross? (Ross is staring off into space.) Ross? (Ross is still frozen) Okay whenever you’re ready. (Sits back and opens her magazine.) And you’re the father by the way—but you got that…
 Rachel: (closes her magazine) Can I get you some water?
 Rachel: Ross there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want. (Ross nods.)
 Rachel: I know. I know but y’know condoms only work like 97% of the time.
 Rachel: They do!
 Rachel: Okay Ross come on let’s just forget about the condoms.
 Rachel: Listen y’know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out…
 Rachel: Y’know what? Let’s let’s talk later.
 Rachel: Okay y’know maybe I should come back… (Starts to leave.)
 Rachel: (stops) Okay.

 Rachel: Yeah maybe if you’re in love. But Ross we are not in love are we?

 Rachel: I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!
 Rachel: Wow. There it is I see it.
 Rachel: Okay.

 Rachel: I know I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can’t even see my own baby!
 Rachel: Oh. Oh it’s beautiful. I see it now.
 Rachel: No I don’t see it!
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: That’s it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh thank you.
 Rachel: Wow! I can’t believe that’s our baby.
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: Oh everything went great.
 Rachel: Oh no I know I couldn’t see it either at first but it’s right umm… (Starts to cry) Ross I lost it again.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Welcome home.
 Rachel: Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!

 Rachel: Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now the father of my child the porn king of the west village.
 Rachel: Thank you. (She sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it with her shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They all yell again.) You don’t want to see this do you?
 Rachel: I am not gonna show you this!

 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: What are you talking about?!
 Rachel: How do you know about that story?!
 Rachel: I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!

 Rachel: So uh apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
 Rachel: It was an amazing night.
 Rachel: You think it looked amazing?
 Rachel: Yeah me neither. Yet…
 Rachel: Yeah it would be really weird.
 Rachel: Good luck to you.

 Rachel: Well don’t—What happened to Jessica’s body?!
 Rachel: You don’t know do you?
 Rachel: Oh! (Motions to Joey’s co-star.)
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: Well Joey probably thinks I’ll just embarrass him. Y’know he thinks I’m some kind of a soap opera nut—Which I’m not! I’m not. Although I do know that your uh your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. (Starts stroking his arm) And uh and that your-your dog’s name is Wally. Well look at that I’m just stroking your arm.
 Rachel: Oh we’re leaving. Bye Kash.
 Rachel: Say hi to Wally.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: I thought I was a complete idiot.
 Rachel: Oh! Oh I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Okay Joey first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
 Rachel: Good-good don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay?
 Rachel: Okay you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more actors! I’ll meet ‘em all!
 Rachel: Hey what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. Umm I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon or I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Oh no I can’t. I got a date.
 Rachel: Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
 Rachel: Yeah—Ooh! Earrings! (Goes into her room.)
 Rachel: (entering from her room) Hey guys do you think this is too slutty—Hi Kash!
 Rachel: Yeah! All right I’ll see you guys later.
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Well I’m alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars what do you think?
 Rachel: I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
 Rachel: Well better than you but y’know still not what you want.
 Rachel: He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh Yeah I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch.
 Rachel: Doesn’t he?
 Rachel: Yes.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: (thinks then gasps) Chandler M. Bing?
 Rachel: Oh my God. (Laughs)
 Rachel: Oh it’s all right. I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing. It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different. This is hard.
 Rachel: Thanks sweetie.
 Rachel: Oh no I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
 Rachel: Oh you did there are twenty in here.
 Rachel: Good night.
 Rachel: Please tell me you’re not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it because soon she won’t be able to fit into it.
 Rachel: Ahh!
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids right now. Y’know ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal instincts.
 Rachel: (to them) Just a minute!!! (She takes the candy and opens the door to two parents a witch a clown and a cowgirl.) Look at you guys! Wow! You are a very scary witch. (Gives her candy.)
 Rachel: And you are a very funny clown. (Gives him candy.)
 Rachel: (to the cowgirl) And you are so in style right now. Y’know I work at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. I don’t suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue but…
 Rachel: Yeah. Sure. (Throws some in her bag and she walks away as Phoebe dressed as Supergirl walks up and eyes Monica who eyes her back.)
 Rachel: (To Monica) Oh you did this to him?
 Rachel: Oh! (Opens the door to reveal a ballerina) Well you’re just the prettiest ballerina I’ve ever seen.
 Rachel: Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.
 Rachel: Well I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.
 Rachel: Ohh… Oh honey here. Take it all. (Pours the entire large bowl into her bag and closes the door.) Monica! We need more candy?
 Rachel: Yeah I know but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave her everything.
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Hi! Y’know what honey we’re actually out of candy right now. But someone just went out to get some and I have been giving out money but I’m out of that too. Hey can I write you a check?
 Rachel: Okay what’s your name?
 Rachel: Okay I’m just gonna write this out to cash.
 Rachel: Hey Mona!
 Rachel: Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet.
 Rachel: Honey someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.
 Rachel: Gotta go! (Opens the door to a boy in a cape.) Hi! Wow! There you go! (Hands him some candy.)
 Rachel: Oh yeah we were but umm now we’ve got candy.
 Rachel: Well that-that’s not your choice. Happy Halloween!
 Rachel: Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff?
 Rachel: You shut up!
 Rachel: Uh I think I just did. And uh-oh here it comes again. Shut up!
 Rachel: (To Joey) Yeah I know—I’m good—I got it! (Joey slowly backs away.) (To the boy) Now wait a minute I’ve got one more thing I have to say to you…oh right! Shut up!
 Rachel: No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook! (Grabs her checkbook and runs after him.)
 Rachel: Hey! Well I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
 Rachel: No I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh I am just awful with children!
 Rachel: Really? You think that’s all it is?
 Rachel: Wow! What did he do?
 Rachel: I can’t. I’m busy. I’m apartment hunting.
 Rachel: Yeah I can’t live with Joey once the baby comes. I don’t want my child’s first words to be (in a baby’s voice) How you doin’?
 Rachel: Well I haven’t discussed it with him yet but I know he’s gonna be relieved. Last week he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
 Rachel: Not so much.
 Rachel: Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
 Rachel: Yeah that would really be great.
 Rachel: Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn’t. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.
 Rachel: Shall we?
 Rachel: And I’m Rachel an admirer of the building.
 Rachel: Ahh.
 Rachel: So she’s really not dead.
 Rachel: Hmm. Do you think—Could you tell me if she’s hanging in in a one bedroom or a two?
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: How was the game?
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.
 Rachel: Oh but Joey I have to go. There’s no room for a baby here.
 Rachel: Honey it’s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there’s a screaming baby around.
 Rachel: Honey it’s so sweet that you want me to stay but I-I can’t do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
 Rachel: I know.
 Rachel: I do too a little bit.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: You gave them to me!
 Rachel: All right I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.
 Rachel: What bra?
 Rachel: You mean the one that you’re wearing? (Adjusts Monica’s pink bra strap as Monica looks down her shirt.)
 Rachel: What is this?
 Rachel: You’re so sweet. (Notices something in the crib.) Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy! (A stuffed penguin wearing a ski jacket goggles and hat.)
 Rachel: But Joey the baby is going to be crying it’s going to be loud.
 Rachel: It’s gonna be up all night!
 Rachel: It’s gonna poop!
 Rachel: What about all the women you want to bring home?
 Rachel: Joey are you sure?
 Rachel: I want me to stay too.
 Rachel: Thank you. (They hug.) Oh Joey and look at this crib! It’s so cute!
 Rachel: Are you serious—Really?! It’s in such good condition.
 Rachel: Wow! Whoa-whoa what’s under the covers?
 Rachel: It’s moving.
 Rachel: It’s still—(Screams)—It’s got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
 Rachel: Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I’m gonna stay here.
 Rachel: (coming from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs?
 Rachel: I’m having dinner with my dad tomorrow night do you wanna come?
 Rachel: Oh no no I’ll be there too.
 Rachel: No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven’t told him I’m pregnant yet.
 Rachel: ‘Cause I know he’s gonna flip out and I hate it when he’s angry.
 Rachel: What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he’d make me eat the entire pack.
 Rachel: Thank you.
 Rachel: (panicking) No you don’t.
 Rachel: Well you could’ve untied it with your hands.
 Rachel: Well actually umm…
 Rachel: (To Phoebe) In case you didn’t notice that is a scary man.
 Rachel: This was such a huge mistake. I can’t tell him Phoebe. I can’t I can’t I can’t I can’t…
 Rachel: No it’s okay this is what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.
 Rachel: Hey that is the…baby’s problem. (Dr. Green returns.) Oh everything okay with the waiter?
 Rachel: Well… Umm I got TiVo.
 Rachel: Phoebe!
 Rachel: Well uh yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up yeah.
 Rachel: No it’s Ross. It’s Ross. You like Ross. (He just shakes his head.) Oh daddy I hope you’re okay with all of this. I mean think about it this is a good thing. You’re gonna—This is your first grandchild! You’re gonna be a poppy!
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Who?
 Rachel: February 2nd!
 Rachel: I know. I know. I panicked I panicked. I didn’t want him to start yelling at me like I was some ’74 Latour.
 Rachel: All right here he comes. I’m gonna do this I’m gonna tell him I’m gonna be strong.
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! (Hugs him and Phoebe glares at her.) Right. Daddy I need to talk to you. Please sit down.
 Rachel: There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
 Rachel: I’m sorry daddy.
 Rachel: Oh now daddy stay calm. Please.
 Rachel: Yes. Yes he says I’m damaged goods.
 Rachel: (quietly) Oh no…
 Rachel: Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person or via e-mail.
 Rachel: Oh okay I’ll fix that to. What’s her e-mail address?
 Rachel: All right I promise. I’ll fix this. I swear. I’ll-I’ll-I’ll-I’ll talk to her.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: I know Mona just hear me out. First of all I’m so sorry about my father yelling at you but I heard you totally held your own. You’re gonna have to tell me how you did that.
 Rachel: Okay. Um…But—Okay yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.
 Rachel: Oh we just—we drove each other crazy!
 Rachel: I mean he was possessive he was jealous he could never just let the little things go!
 Rachel: Right! But none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is. (Rubbing his shoulder.)
 Rachel: I know I get it but Mona what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? (Mona looks at her.) I am so gonna leave right now. (Ross opens the door for her and she leaves.)
 Rachel: (entering) Forgot my purse! (Sees them kissing.) Oh you guys made up. (To Mona) He’s a good kisser isn’t he? (Ross goes to close the door on her.) I’m going! (Quickly leaves and Ross locks the door.)
 Rachel: About an hour ago.
 Rachel: Yes! (She gets up and sets the phone on the counter without hanging it up.) Bye daddy. (Phoebe and her leave.)
 Rachel: (looking at her fingers) Oh my…God! Let me see that! (Grabs the book from him.)
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Oh Pheebs that’s so sweet—(Grabs a pair of pants)—Ooh those are so cute!
 Rachel: No.
 Rachel: Wow! I don’t remember him. Honey are you sure you’re not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
 Rachel: Oh that’s nice.
 Rachel: Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
 Rachel: (entering carrying a baking dish) Hi!
 Rachel: (sees Will) Oh my God Monica who is that?
 Rachel: Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! Hes really got that sexy smoldering thing going on. (We see Will angrily staring at Rachel.) Oh my God he’s… Look at the way he’s just staring at me. I think he’s trying to mouth something to me but I can’t make it out. (Will mouths I hate you.)
 Rachel: Hi! Will right?
 Rachel: Hi! I’m Rachel Green.
 Rachel: Really?! Aren’t you sweet! I gotta tell you though I am I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm did we fool around at Lance Davis’ graduation party?
 Rachel: Thank you!
 Rachel: All right who would uh like some yams? Will?

 Rachel: I’m sorry. What?
 Rachel: Umm I’m sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?
 Rachel: I’m-I’m—I had no idea. I’m sorry. I…
 Rachel: Uh Will umm I just want to say that I’m real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school…
 Rachel: You had a club?!
 Rachel: Whoa! My God! So what you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?
 Rachel: (To Ross) So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
 Rachel: So who else was in this club?
 Rachel: So Ross we went out for two years and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.
 Rachel: Okay Monica did you know about this?!
 Rachel: Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?
 Rachel: What rumor?
 Rachel: Ross!
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: (shocked) Oh my God!
 Rachel: What?! You heard that?! (Goes and stands behind Joey.)
 Rachel: Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn’t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region! (Motions to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.)
 Rachel: Monica how come you never told me this?!
 Rachel: Joey stop staring! There’s nothing there! It’s not true!
 Rachel: Oh! (Hits him and storms out.)
 Rachel: (entering carrying a book) Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year Dear Rach you’re such a good person. Not girl! Person!

 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
 Rachel: Ohh there’s a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
 Rachel: Wh—Phoebe!!
 Rachel: All right y’know—Fine! You guys have your stupid little club but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie! (Will laughs.)

 Rachel: Return them?! Shh! They’re gonna hear you!
 Rachel: (pause) He’s talking to the baby.
 Rachel: Okay. Well I gotta go you guys. I’ll see you later.
 Rachel: Bye. (She gets up to leave but is stopped by Joey)
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: No forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.
 Rachel: I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors…

 Rachel: Oh Joey I’m hardly a…
 Rachel: Right! Hi Dina!
 Rachel: Nice to meet you. (They shake hands.)
 Rachel: Okay. All right Dina well let’s talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let’s see there’s design but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh there’s-there’s sales which is great because you get to travel…
 Rachel: (stunned) And there’s marketing…
 Rachel: Honey it’s going to be okay. He’s been incredibly supportive of me and if he gets a little upset; that’s what the meatball sub is for. (She gives Dina a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil.)
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Honey why don’t you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
 Rachel: Joey…there’s something that you…should know. Dina?
 Rachel: (To Dina) Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! (She quickly sets the sandwich in front of him.)
 Rachel: What?! Dina…
 Rachel: I know.
 Rachel: What college was that Dina?
 Rachel: Joey what are you doing?
 Rachel: Oh Joey this is crazy!
 Rachel: All right Joey! That is enough! (Grabs him and pulls him away from Bobby and Dina) Listen as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is it’s not legal. Okay? They-they don’t have a marriage license they don’t have any witnesses and the groom only has on one shoe!
 Rachel: You’re supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.
 Rachel: Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! (To Bobby and Dina) Right?
 Rachel: Oh come on kids! A little help here!
 Rachel: Joey just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!
 Rachel: Hey now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby why don’t you tell us a little bit about your band?
 Rachel: (To Dina) Really? (Nods her head at Bobby.)
 Rachel: Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
 Rachel: So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
 Rachel: Okay Bobby why don’t we just come over here and let them have a little moment. (Drags Bobby away from Joey and Dina.)
 Rachel: No! Seriously! What’s wrong with you?!
 Rachel: Phoebe?
 Rachel: Look at that guy by the window wow!
 Rachel: Oh what is wrong with me lately? I mean it’s like every guy I see—I mean look here. (Points behind them) Look at that guy for example I mean normally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to but right now with the way I’m feeling all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Really?! So this has happened to you?
 Rachel: Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend I went from store to store sitting on Santa’s lap.
 Rachel: Ah.
 Rachel: Well y’know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow I’ll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Oh okay. Hey can I ask you a question? Was it me or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y’know who I’m talking about bald haircut hairy fingers… (Stops when she realizes it was her.)
 Rachel: Yes you are.
 Rachel: Oh really really good. But enough about me come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?
 Rachel: Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?
 Rachel: Oh I love to ski! How amazing is this?!
 Rachel: No. I’m very comfortable.
 Rachel: No! Shoot Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
 Rachel: Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
 Rachel: Do you feel it too?
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: Well let’s see. Uh they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.
 Rachel: Okay even this is turning me on!
 Rachel: Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it how’s it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?
 Rachel: Uh Ross? You asked me that.
 Rachel: I think if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.
 Rachel: You gave her a key to your apartment?!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Yeah. (They go into the kitchen.)
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Phoebe no!
 Rachel: No! I do not care what my hormones are doing I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
 Rachel: Yes. Hi I’d like to order a pizza. Okay can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. (Joey enters.) I’ll call you back.
 Rachel: It’s just the pizza place.
 Rachel: I’m sorry honey I’m just having a having a rough day.
 Rachel: Oh you really you really just don’t want to hear about it.
 Rachel: Okay it’s just—and this is really embarrassing—but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I’m just finding myself…how do I put this umm erotically charged.
 Rachel: Yeah. So y’know I have all of these feelings and I don’t know what to do about them because I can’t date like a normal person which is fine because I don’t need a relationship I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex y’know? No strings attached no relationship just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he’s doing. For just one great night I mean is that really so…hard…to find. (Looks at Joey.) So how was your day?
 Rachel: Well I gotta get up early and it’s almost seven o’clock.
 Rachel: Okay good night!
 Rachel: (entering) I didn’t ask you to do it!
 Rachel: You’re Joey!
 Rachel: Right back at ya!
 Rachel: And so bad. I don’t even know what you’re talking about because I didn’t ask you to do anything!
 Rachel: No!
 Rachel: That’s the end of this conversation!
 Rachel: Never happened! Good night!
 Rachel: They made you head of the department!
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Uh Paul’s Caf�. They got great food and it’s really romantic.
 Rachel: Yeah! Oh and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing—Oh! Take her dancing!
 Rachel: Ooh I miss dating. Gettin’ all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I’m not gonna be able to do that for so long and it’s so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
 Rachel: Huh?
 Rachel: What?! Joey you don’t want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
 Rachel: (interrupting) Okay! I’ll go with ya! I’ll go! I’ll go with ya.
 Rachel: All right?
 Rachel: Joey? Could you get that? (There is no answer and she goes and opens the door to Joey.) What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
 Rachel: Ohh Lilies. Joey they’re my favorite. Thank you.
 Rachel: Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I’m going on a real date! Although I have a hint of morning sickness and I’m wearing underwear that goes up to about…(She snaps the waistband on her underwear that is just slightly below her breasts)…there.
 Rachel: Yeah actually that’s my roommate’s.
 Rachel: Ah yes but he’s very protective of me so you’d better watch yourself.
 Rachel: Hm-mmm.
 Rachel: (laughs) Yeah but I’m pretty sure he’s gay.
 Rachel: Now the filet mignon what comes with that?
 Rachel: Emmm. Now instead of the vegetables is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?
 Rachel: Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date—Oh I almost forgot. I didn’t pay you the rent check.
 Rachel: Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?
 Rachel: I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
 Rachel: Oh my God. And that works?!
 Rachel: Oh you poor little famous man.
 Rachel: (looks interested) Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic I almost leaned in. I really almost did!
 Rachel: Alright. So where’d you grow up?
 Rachel: Come on just answer the question!
 Rachel: And so were-were you close to your parents?
 Rachel: Why not?
 Rachel: (sympathetic) Oh. (Starts rubbing his wrist with her fingers.) It’s gotta be rough.
 Rachel: Huh?
 Rachel: Thank you! And now if you’ll excuse me I have to go to the rest room.
 Rachel: And now you’re watching me walk away.
 Rachel: I am not gonna answer that!
 Rachel: No one! They are my friends I wouldn’t punch any of them.
 Rachel: Yeah but I don’t know why. Look at me I’m having such a wonderful time!
 Rachel: I know!
 Rachel: Joey I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
 Rachel: Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
 Rachel: All right now don’t judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves but you live here. I’m ripping into this swan.
 Rachel: So tell me what are Joey Tribbiani’s end of the night moves?
 Rachel: How do you do that?
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: No I don’t want to tell you.
 Rachel: Because it’s embarrassing.
 Rachel: (laughs) Okay. All right stand up. (They do so.) Well when we’re at the door I lightly press my lips against his and then move into his body just for a second and then I make this sound Hmmm. Okay I know it doesn’t sound like anything but I swear it works.
 Rachel: All right I gotta go to bed. Honey I had such a wonderful time.
 Rachel: …you were 50 minutes late to the class what did you crawl there?!
 Rachel: Well why didn’t you just take a cab?
 Rachel: Well you’re not gonna be able to keep doing this.
 Rachel: You what?
 Rachel: Right. Wow!
 Rachel: Hi! Hey remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?
 Rachel: Relax! It’s not like it’s Citizen Kane!
 Rachel: Yeah I know it’s really boring but it’s like a big deal. Anyway I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.
 Rachel: Well don’t you have that big date tonight?
 Rachel: Hey Joey can I ask you something?
 Rachel: After our date last night did you feel a little weird?
 Rachel: I don’t know! (Pause) I’m-I’m kinda thinking it-it was the lobster…
 Rachel: Yeah I mean I was up sick all night.
 Rachel: Really?! How come we didn’t cross paths?
 Rachel: Oh God! Thank God you’re home! I’m watching Cujo.
 Rachel: Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
 Rachel: No! No! Seriously what’s wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?
 Rachel: Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
 Rachel: Y’know I never thought I’d say this about a movie but I really hope this dog dies. (Joey brings over a stool at sits on it next to Rachel who’s in the big chair.) What are you doing over there? Come sit here you protect me.
 Rachel: Okay. (Pushes play.) Okay that’s him! That’s him! That’s Cujo! That’s Cujo!
 Rachel: Oh my God….What’s he gonna do now? I can’t watch! (Drags Joey closer to her and cowers into his chest.) Oh. Seriously how can you watch this? Aren’t you scared?
 Rachel: (coming from her room) Hi sweetie.
 Rachel: Hi! Oh Ross don’t forget we have that doctor’s appointment tomorrow!
 Rachel: Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
 Rachel: Popular.
 Rachel: Oh yeah! I’ve come up with a bunch of ideas!
 Rachel: Really?!
 Rachel: Okay! I was thinking if it’s a girl how about Sandrine? It’s French.
 Rachel: Okay fine what do you have?
 Rachel: Wow oh my God our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
 Rachel: I’m really really not.
 Rachel: All right.
 Rachel: Yeah! I don’t think you’re going to need it though. Okay check this out. If it’s a girl Rain.
 Rachel: Why?
 Rachel: Ross why do you hate our child?
 Rachel: Okay James.
 Rachel: But only if it’s a girl.
 Rachel: Oh! I’m sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
 Rachel: Veto. Sawyer?
 Rachel: Veto.
 Rachel: Oh oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
 Rachel: But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it’s a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?
 Rachel: Right. Right.
 Rachel: (looking at the bulletin board with baby pictures) So which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
 Rachel: Third one from the left?
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: I didn’t!
 Rachel: Okay fine I did. But I didn’t see anything I swear.
 Rachel: Okay but Ross just listen to me…
 Rachel: But I couldn’t even if I wanted to because I don’t know! I swear; I didn’t see anything and I don’t want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.
 Rachel: (holding stomach) Okay a couple months late on the lecture Ross.
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: You know what? I’ve been thinking about it. I’m really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
 Rachel: I didn’t see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
 Rachel: I would—Sequoia?
 Rachel: Fine.
 Rachel: But Ross you want the name Ruth!
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Ross I swear I don’t know.
 Rachel: A what?!
 Rachel: We’re having a girl?
 Rachel: That’s what you just said!
 Rachel: You said girl!
 Rachel: I’m not! We’re having a girl! Sometimes I can’t believe it’s with you—But still! We’re having a girl!
 Rachel: Oh yes! We’ll have ourselves a little baby Ruth…
 Rachel: Yes please.
 Rachel: (entering) Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? (Looks at Chandler) Oh my! (Covers the spot where Joey wants bubbles to be replaced.)
 Rachel: No I was waiting for you!
 Rachel: We’re having a girl.
 Rachel: (entering) Hi sweetie.
 Rachel: Oh Joey I’m so happy things worked out for us that we’re having this baby together. I love you so much.
 Rachel: And I hope it’s not an inappropriate time to say this but you’re the best sex I ever had.
 Rachel: (bursts into the room) Joey! Joey!
 Rachel: Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
 Rachel: Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!
 Rachel: Yes!
 Rachel: Oh okay! (She goes over to him and he feels her belly.)
 Rachel: Aw it’s unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh she’s like umm…oh…who’s that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
 Rachel: Mia Hamm!
 Rachel: (looking down) Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
 Rachel: It’s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do (Mimics him) that again.
 Rachel: Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey’s room and he was sleeping…
 Rachel: Joey. Joey something feels weird and not good weird. I don’t—Whoa!! (Winces in pain.)
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Okay. Oh God—Ow!—Oo!
 Rachel: Hmm mild discomfort. So I take it you’ve had one of these Braxton thingies?
 Rachel: Thank you doctor. (Dr. Long exits.) (To Joey) Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
 Rachel: But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
 Rachel: But I—But everything is okay. I’m fine!
 Rachel: Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterus though. Mild discomfort what’s he talking about?
 Rachel: Yeah everything’s fine!
 Rachel: Okay no uterus no opinion.
 Rachel: Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
 Rachel: Oh I gotta go back in there.
 Rachel: No everything’s fine. I just gotta go back…
 Rachel: I-I forgot my underwear. (Ross lets her go.)
 Rachel: Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
 Rachel: Ohh! That’s so sweet of you! Oh yum! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich and starts to get sick.) Did you put pickles on this?
 Rachel: Oh Ross!! (Runs to the bathroom and closes the door.)
 Rachel: Yeah I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?
 Rachel: (entering) Well if anyone is keeping score I no longer eat tuna.
 Rachel: What’s up?
 Rachel: (Gasps) Are you breaking up with us?
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?
 Rachel: But Joey I don’t think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean—(Ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)—Or he does.
 Rachel: But Ross its you and me!
 Rachel: I don’t know. Is it crazy?
 Rachel: Okay let’s do it. I’ll move in.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Hi! Hey Happy Valentine’s Day!
 Rachel: It’s good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages? (to the waitress handing her a cup of coffee) Oh thank you. I’ll see you guys later.
 Rachel: (entering) Hi.
 Rachel: I accidentally packed these with my stuff. (looks at the dog and gasps) Who is this?
 Rachel: (talking with a higher voice and puckered lips…kind of like you do to a baby or...well…a puppy…it’s hard to explain. Just use your imagination!) Oh well you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more but I’ve got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting yes I do. Yes I do. (still talking like that) Bye-bye Joey. Oh I seriously can’t stop it. (exits)
 Rachel: Oh I’ve got big Valentine’s plans! I’ve got my Chinese food on the way and the rest of your saltwater taffy!
 Rachel: Ross we actually watched the documentary together.
 Rachel: Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! (runs to her room to get her money)
 Rachel: (entering) Oh hey Mona!
 Rachel: I’ll be watching TV if anybody needs me. (exits to her room)
 Rachel: I’m not here! That’s just my Chinese food!
 Rachel: You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to get in my sweats and eat this in bed! (exits)
 Rachel: (entering) I’m just going to grab the phone.
 Rachel: Oh I’m sorry! Do you need the phone?
 Rachel: (as Ross enters with a present) But but Mona I live here.
 Rachel: (entering) Hi! I’m so sorry to barge in on your Valentine’s but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.
 Rachel: Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
 Rachel: Well now wait. Now I’m all freaked out. Come on you guys will watch it with me.
 Rachel: C’mon seriously you guys you’re not going to make me watch this alone!
 Rachel: Okay. (watching the tape) Ooh my! (Rachel jumps when the woman starts screaming) Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
 Rachel: Uh! It’s horrible!
 Rachel: Oh my God!
 Rachel: What? Did her ass explode?!
 Rachel: Oh screw you guys you don’t have to do it!
 Rachel: (thinking) You’re going to have a baby and you need to be prepared. Now you’re going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it! (Rachel puts the tape in the VCR)
 Rachel: (thinking) Hmm…maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
 Rachel: Oh-oh! Okay she’s kicking!
 Rachel: Whoa!!
 Rachel: Wow that was a big one.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.
 Rachel: (To Phoebe) Well what’s he like?!
 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: Of course of course.
 Rachel: Oh sure. Older?
 Rachel: Oh I was just gonna ask!
 Rachel: Oh it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.
 Rachel: Joey? What’s up?
 Rachel: Okay what’s up?
 Rachel: Well honey I’m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
 Rachel: Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay? (Walks away.)
 Rachel: …and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I’m really worried the baby’s not going to like him. (Joey is staring at the table.) Are you okay?
 Rachel: No. Not-not for me but why don’t you take off your sweater?
 Rachel: Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
 Rachel: Huh. Wow I wouldn’t think Hobbs would like that so much.
 Rachel: Um seven…e-e-eight eight years. Wow.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: So you were saying?
 Rachel: Okay well you had asked me how long we had known each other and I said Eight years. And the um waiter came over and cut his tip in half and umm…now here we are.
 Rachel: (stunned) What?
 Rachel: (looking around) Who are you talking too? Oh you’re kidding! Oh it’s a joke! (Laughs.) It’s funny. It’s funny. I don’t get it. (Joey doesn’t say any thing and Rachel realizes it’s not a joke.) Oh. (Pause) Okay. Umm… I-I…uh wow. Are you uh… How did umm… When?
 Rachel: Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow it is hot in here.
 Rachel: Joey Joey I love you so much but I…
 Rachel: Joey.
 Rachel: No! Joey please! Please don’t! Please don’t leave like this! Now come on you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! (Starts to cry.)
 Rachel: Can I? (Hug him.)
 Rachel: Oh Joey honey I don’t…I don’t want to lose…
 Rachel: I’m so sorry.
 Rachel: Yeah that was a real good one.
 Rachel: Joey? Are you in there?
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Is Joey here?
 Rachel: Well at least you make each other laugh.
 Rachel: Well I haven’t seen him since that night that he told me how he y’know… I don’t know I think he’s avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?
 Rachel: Ew was Chandler naked? Sort of like a like a ring toss kind of situation?
 Rachel: All right. Well listen if you see Joey will you just tell him uh…tell him I miss him. (Exits and Joey enters.)
 Rachel: Okay I’m done. Do mine.
 Rachel: Ah.
 Rachel: Well I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
 Rachel: Well just ask Mona to give it back!
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out but it’s not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.
 Rachel: How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!
 Rachel: Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!
 Rachel: Oh yeah. That makes sense.
 Rachel: Ooh I can do that.
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Yeah it’s umm… Yeah it’s uh… It-it’s y’know—It’s nothing.
 Rachel: Yeah—No wait! Joey no wait it is. It’s something. It’s-it’s umm…it’s my boss.
 Rachel: Yeah and umm my baby.
 Rachel: My boss wants to buy my baby!
 Rachel: I know I told you it’s a really big problem.
 Rachel: Can you believe that?!
 Rachel: That’s what I told him!
 Rachel: Well I’ll tell ya! (Pause) See uh my-my boss and his wife—They-they can’t have children. So umm and that—we were at the Christmas party and he got drunk and he said to me Rachel I want to buy your baby.
 Rachel: Ohh! Yeah! (Pause) Yeah that-that would’ve been a much simpler problem.
 Rachel: (entering) Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
 Rachel: Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
 Rachel: Oh that’s not important. The point is I really—I think everything’s gonna be okay.
 Rachel: Hey! Oh Joey honey listen thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.
 Rachel: (worried) What?
 Rachel: Whoa-whoa-whoa let’s say more!
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: No! No no-no-no Joey he doesn’t want to buy my baby! I made that up!
 Rachel: So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn’t be awkward!
 Rachel: (To Joey) I can’t believe that you yelled at my boss! I’m-I’m gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
 Rachel: Oh Joey I can’t believe you brought my boss into this! I’m gonna get fired!
 Rachel: Well she told me too! (Points to Monica and Joey glares at her.)
 Rachel: Morning. You wanted to see me?
 Rachel: Okay look Mr. Zelner…
 Rachel: Yeah. (Motions for him to continue.)
 Rachel: Oh God.
 Rachel: Well as long as we are clear about that. (Exits smugly.)
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: It’s all gonna be okay. They’re just so happy that I’m not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.
 Rachel: Chandler can you give us a minute?
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Joey I’m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things…
 Rachel: It kinda worked. I mean y’know I don’t know about you buy I haven’t thought about our thing since all this.
 Rachel: Yeah I know! I miss that.
 Rachel: My gynecologist tried to kill me.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Hey do you guys have any extra ribbon?
 Rachel: I uh think you already are.
 Rachel: Yeah yeah I like him a lot.
 Rachel: Yeah otherwise I’m not going.
 Rachel: This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?
 Rachel: Hmmm….
 Rachel: Thank you…we’re so excited
 Rachel: Yeah if you’re going to do the ears you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.
 Rachel: No I know I don’t either but ya know what it’s their party and it’s just one night. And we don’t even have to lie; we just won’t say anything. If it comes up again we’ll just…smile. We’ll nod along.
 Rachel: Oh…
 Rachel: (looking at the check) Unbelievable!
 Rachel: Open it! Open it! Open it!
 Rachel: But it was beautiful. I mean it was small but kind of spectacular.
 Rachel: On a cliff in Barbados at sunset and Stevie Wonder sang Isn’t She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.
 Rachel: Yeah Stevie’s an old family friend. (Hits Ross’s chest)
 Rachel: So would I. You wouldn’t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.
 Rachel: What? I’m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.
 Rachel: Okay Ross it has to be realistic.
 Rachel: And my veil was lace made by blind Belgium nuns.
 Rachel: Well not at first but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight it was all worth it.
 Rachel: Well I don’t know about that but some said that I looked like a floating angel.
 Rachel: Oh yeah. That’s a great story.
 Rachel: Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
 Rachel: And the ring was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!
 Rachel: Ross it just wouldn’t have been feasible.
 Rachel: It was really fun being married to you tonight.
 Rachel: Okay Ross can I uh can I ask you something?
 Rachel: That proposal at the planetarium…
 Rachel: Are you kidding?! With the with the lilies and-and the song and the stars! It was…really wonderful! Did you just make that up?
 Rachel: Well that would’ve been very hard to say no too.
 Rachel: Goodnight
 Rachel: I will think about it.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: So I’m in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle and guess who the clue is for three down. (She hands the magazine to Joey.)
 Rachel: So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?
 Rachel: Oh come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention oh I don’t know gal pal Rachel Green?
 Rachel: Okay don’t listen to him. Please?
 Rachel: Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. (Excited) Ha-ha! I’m gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. (Looks at Joey.) Seriously proud of you.
 Rachel: Oh yeah I’d actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
 Rachel: That is the Coast Guard.
 Rachel: It’s a trifle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers then a layer of jam then custard which I made from scratch. [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries more ladyfingers then beef saut�ed with peas and onions [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then a little more custard and then bananas and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
 Rachel: Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!
 Rachel: Hey come on now!
 Rachel: (interrupting him) Hi! I’m gal pal Rachel Green and if you want the dirt I’m the one you come too. This might be Joey’s baby (rubbing her stomach) who knows? I’m just kidding—Seriously (leans into the cassette recorder Shelley is using) gal pal Rachel Green.
 Rachel: (scoffs at him) Yeah that’s gonna get you into Soap Opera Digest. Well I…(leans into the microphone again)…I would just like to say that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.
 Rachel: You too!
 Rachel: Oh Joey! Sorry!
 Rachel: Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: I’ve never lived like this before.
 Rachel: Oh my God Jill!
 Rachel: This is Chandler. (Points at him.)
 Rachel: And you know Monica and Ross!
 Rachel: And that’s Phoebe (points) and that’s Joey.
 Rachel: Don’t!! (Joey backs away frightened.)
 Rachel: Yeah!
 Rachel: Wow! I can’t believe they didn’t put it in the part where you said you didn’t watch soap operas.
 Rachel: (entering) Hi!
 Rachel: So what’s the final head count on my baby shower?
 Rachel: What?! You mean they’re not coming to a social event where there’s no men and there’s no booze?! That’s shocking! I don’t care as long as my mom’s here.
 Rachel: What?! My mom’s not gonna be here?!
 Rachel: My God!
 Rachel: So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
 Rachel: Please make sure she comes. It’s really important to me I mean it’s my mom!
 Rachel: I don’t know.
 Rachel: Okay. (Mrs. Green helps her up and they walk over and get some tea.)
 Rachel: Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh I don’t even have a housekeeper.
 Rachel: Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it tu madre es loca. (I think that’s your mother’s crazy.)
 Rachel: Well however great she was I just can’t afford that.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Wh-wh-what? What?
 Rachel: Yes. Yes I do.
 Rachel: Why did you invite my mother?!
 Rachel: She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
 Rachel: Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother but my God a long lunch with her is taxing.
 Rachel: What? You guys come on! What am I going to do?
 Rachel: You’re right. You’re right. I mean I’m about to have a baby I can tell my mother that I don’t want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She’s gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!
 Rachel: Okay. (She goes over to tell her mother.)
 Rachel: Mom that’s okay that you didn’t get you a gift!
 Rachel: Oh yeah. Okay see mom the truth is I can do this on my own.
 Rachel: But mom I really know what I’m doing. I can handle this.
 Rachel: He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
 Rachel: Wow!
 Rachel: Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh I know what this is! (She’s holding an item with a large suction cup connected to a yellow plastic box with a long narrow tube and bottle connected the yellow part.) Wait a minute. That can’t be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?
 Rachel: Did I say I was done guessing? Okay thank you for that. Oh wow! What’s this?
 Rachel: Oh it dispenses clean diapers!
 Rachel: Well that’s gross why don’t you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?
 Rachel: What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!
 Rachel: I don’t know I’d leave it on the changing table? (Everyone gasps.) What?! What’d I do? What’d I do?!
 Rachel: Oh come—(Stutters)—Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would—she wouldn’t be safe as she would be with me the baby dummy. Oh God okay. Y’know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm I’m just gonna maybe open them a little bit later but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts and this basket is beautiful.
 Rachel: Okay mommy don’t ever leave me. (Hugs her.)
 Rachel: So umm you’re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
 Rachel: Oh mom I swear I’m not an idiot. I’ve read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth but I-I just didn’t think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby’s coming and I don’t know what to do. Oh can I throw up in my diaper genie?
 Rachel: Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Oh we did but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
 Rachel: No. She’s going to live with us for eight weeks.
 Rachel: Yes! She’s gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. (Sees that Ross isn’t happy.)
 Rachel: I do. I really do. I don’t know anything.
 Rachel: Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
 Rachel: Hello?! I still don’t know what the hell I’m doing!
 Rachel: I hope you’re going somewhere with this.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Thank you. (Hugs him.)
 Rachel: (closing a book) Okay! I’m ready.
 Rachel: Yes I’ve done my studying and I really know my stuff.
 Rachel: Uh put your elbow in it.
 Rachel: Full dry on its back and no loose covers.
 Rachel: Check if it’s wet check if it’s hungry burp it!
 Rachel: A card! A card! I pick a card!
 Rachel: Yeah but y’know what they say Mon There’s no such thing as bad press.
 Rachel: I didn’t write it.
 Rachel: Ross!
 Rachel: I am freaking out!
 Rachel: My due date is in one week!
 Rachel: That is seven days!
 Rachel: (interrupting him) No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!
 Rachel: I’m serious.
 Rachel: Okay. Thank you. That’s great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there’s this really cute shoe store that has like this little…
 Rachel: (stopping him) Oh wait Ross! I’m sorry one more thing!
 Rachel: Umm our situation. Y’know umm what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we’re having this baby together and we live together. Isn’t that isn’t that weird?
 Rachel: I’m just kidding! You can go pee! (He does so in a hurry.)
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: No-no-no! No no no we’re not married.
 Rachel: Oh yeah! Actually that’s one of the reasons why we’re not a couple.
 Rachel: Oh. Oh yeah don’t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he’s a doctor but he’s not.
 Rachel: Oh my God! I’m standing at a cash register holding a credit card and I’m bored.
 Rachel: Hi Pheebs!
 Rachel: Oh it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross almost got something that wasn’t on the list. A whore.
 Rachel: Well we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: You don’t understand! You didn’t see how brazen she was.
 Rachel: No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’s that I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl at Sluts ‘R’ Us!
 Rachel: Oh yeah! You really—You look great.
 Rachel: Chandler I’m not gonna lie to ya but I am gonna run away from you. (Gets up and hurries out.)
 Rachel: All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
 Rachel: Horny bitch. (They both look at her pretending that the dinosaurs she’s holding are arguing.) No! You’re a horny bitch! Noooo! You’re the horny bitch! No! You’re a horny bitch!
 Rachel: So you guys go have a really good time.
 Rachel: So you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.
 Rachel: Oh yeah! Yeah please you guys have fun.
 Rachel: Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic although you missed a button.
 Rachel: Oh okay I see what you’re doing there.
 Rachel: Hi! You’re back from your date!
 Rachel: I’m fine but that’s not important. What’s important is how was she?
 Rachel: Oh uh-huh uh-huh coffee a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
 Rachel: No! No she’s—She was nice. I mean she’s a little slutty but who isn’t?
 Rachel: Of course you did Ross you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!
 Rachel: No! It’s just that Kate bothered me.
 Rachel: There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!
 Rachel: I don’t want you to date her!
 Rachel: Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me but because I don’t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it’s a terrible thing to even think this and it’s completely inappropriate but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I’m very sorry but that is just the way that I feel.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Really? But I’m being so unreasonable.
 Rachel: (starting to cry) Oh Ross thank you. Thank you. (They hug.)
 Rachel: No not really. You’re pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry. (She gets up and starts for the bathroom.)
 Rachel: Yeah. (Stops and starts doing the I-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.)
 Rachel: Uh-huh.
 Rachel: (pause) Wow! I don’t know maybe. I’m…
 Rachel: (laughs) I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin’ with you too!
 Rachel: Oh no-no-no-no no!
 Rachel: No that’s just—(Laughs)—That’s just ‘cause I’m such a good messer!
 Rachel: Yeah?
 Rachel: Right! (Heads for the bathroom.)
 Rachel: Well obviously I won’t be able to come for those of you who haven’t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y’know I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you’ve been during this time. I really couldn’t have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part I am really gonna miss being pregnant.
 Rachel: That’s right still no baby! (To Monica Joey and Chandler on the couch) Come on people! Please make some room!
 Rachel: You. Like you haven’t done enough.
 Rachel: God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
 Rachel: (interrupting her) Oh Phoebe that’s a great story. Can you tell it to me when you’re getting me some iced tea? (Phoebe gets up and Rachel groans.) (To the baby) Oh God get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!
 Rachel: Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? ‘Cause I’ll do it.
 Rachel: They sent me home from work. They were like Start your maternity leave now! Just rest get ready for the baby. Well y’know what? Screw ‘em! If they don’t want me there I’ll just hang out with you guys.
 Rachel: (overhearing that) What-what about me?
 Rachel: I don’t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I’m pregnant you think I’m invisible.
 Rachel: Oh I have to pee. If I don’t come out in five minutes it’s because I’ve choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)
 Rachel: (calling from the bathroom) All right who’s turn is it to help me get up!
 Rachel: Oh I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)
 Rachel: In a minute!!!
 Rachel: (entering) All right all right. Let’s go!
 Rachel: No I’m fine.
 Rachel: Ross it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks I am somewhat comfortable.
 Rachel: Oh uh-uh pal! Don’t call me mommy! It’s bad enough you call your own mother that. (He looks at Monica.)
 Rachel: Ross.
 Rachel: Can I ask you something?
 Rachel: When Carol was pregnant with Ben…
 Rachel: …were you this irritating?
 Rachel: Excuse me?!
 Rachel: Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
 Rachel: (silently) Okay. (Pause) Seriously breathe louder Ross! That’s great!
 Rachel: Hi Dr. Long how are you?
 Rachel: She has the drugs!
 Rachel: Okay. (Rachel lies back.)
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: Eh just a tad.
 Rachel: Well we are ready to try anything.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Great! We will do all of those.
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
 Rachel: Well there is one thing that we haven’t tried but someone thinks that (mimicking Ross) That will open up a can of worms.
 Rachel: Why? Why today?
 Rachel: I’ll take that bet.
 Rachel: Well I’m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!
 Rachel: Oh honey don’t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow’s the day.
 Rachel: Ross I—We tried all the spicy food. It’s not working.
 Rachel: I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
 Rachel: Oh come on Ross why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what’s gonna work! It’s doctor recommended!
 Rachel: Oh come on Ross we’ve done it before we’ll do it again it’ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
 Rachel: Make love? What are you a girl?
 Rachel: But you will you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle y’know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.
 Rachel: Oh I know it. You’re right. That’s not sexy. Oh…Oh! (Drops a fork on the floor.) Whoops! Oh I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it. (Tries too but can’t quite seem to make it.) Oh God!
 Rachel: Come on Ross! I’m miserable here! Come on! You started this now you finish it! Come on wuss make love to me.
 Rachel: What?!
 Rachel: Oh wow! What now Ross you’re not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute I know. (Mimics his breathing.) I mean you’d think the damn jalepeno would’ve cleared up your sinuses but no!! That’s not enough… (Ross jumps over and kisses her.) What are you doing?!
 Rachel: (breaking the kiss) Oh God!
 Rachel: Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
 Rachel: Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
 Rachel: Yeah.
 Rachel: I didn’t uh really have time to read this part of the books but do you think we have time to…
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: (deadpan) Yes the hard part is truly over.
 Rachel: Hi! (Ross is stunned.)
 Rachel: Ross you stay here and talk I’m gonna go have a baby.
 Rachel: (interrupting her) Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I’m sorry semi-private? We (Laughs) we asked for a private room.
 Rachel: Okay. Just give us a second. Ross! (They walk away from the desk.)
 Rachel: Give her some money.
 Rachel: They’re not!! Ross they’re just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
 Rachel: (standing up) Okay. Y’know what? I’d have to say I really don’t care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to—Whoa! (She starts a contraction) Oh gosh! Whoa!
 Rachel: Ow! Ow! Contraction. (Sits back down.) Ow-ow! Ow-ow! (Starts breathing heavily.)
 Rachel: Yeah it couldn’t hurt to look.
 Rachel: Oh okay.
 Rachel: Thank you. (Dr. Long exits.) Well I guess we have some time to kill.
 Rachel: Yeah well it looks great!
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: How are you?
 Rachel: Yeah it is.
 Rachel: That’s so sweet.
 Rachel: Oh.
 Rachel: Oh no I really don’t want any—(He takes the picture)—Oh! Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross…
 Rachel: Here comes another contraction.
 Rachel: Oh that’s very—Really very-very okay.
 Rachel: (simultaneously as Ross) No I don’t think we’ll be doing that.
 Rachel: Oh. Oh wait no.
 Rachel: No-no-don’t! Don’t leave me here with these people.
 Rachel: No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Oh thank you so much for coming. Ross get in here!
 Rachel: New people.
 Rachel: They’re having their baby! It’s not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
 Rachel: Well they have uh some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm evil bitch and uh sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!
 Rachel: Ooh! Ow!!
 Rachel: Ross.
 Rachel: He’s looking at me.
 Rachel: Ugh is she pregnant yet? She doesn’t need to be; she’ll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross another contraction! (Leans back on Ross for some support.)
 Rachel: Yeah it was.
 Rachel: Dr. Long I’ve been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
 Rachel: Hey y’know what? I’m not waiting! I’m gonna push this baby out! I’m doing it! I mean it’s what? Three centimeters? That’s gotta be like this! (Holds her hands a couple inches apart.)
 Rachel: Oh stupid metric system!
 Rachel: Oh for the love of God!
 Rachel: Oh come on!!
 Rachel: Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women that’s four one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated have come and gone with their babies! I’m next! It’s my turn! It’s only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to sue you! Not this hospital I’m going to sue you! And my husband (Points at Ross) he’s a lawyer!
 Rachel: Go get back on that case honey!
 Rachel: Okay well then bring her in.
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: I get it!
 Rachel: Oh we-we didn’t.
 Rachel: Just tell me how.
 Rachel: Oh hi.
 Rachel: Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
 Rachel: Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?
 Rachel: Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! (Starts another contraction as Dr. Long enters.)
 Rachel: Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: My God. Okay. (Another woman enters.) Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
 Rachel: 3-2-1 oh!!
 Rachel: I can’t. I can’t push anymore I can’t.
 Rachel: Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
 Rachel: Don’t say Oh my God! Oh my God what?
 Rachel: Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?
 Rachel: I’m sorry I can’t!
 Rachel: I can’t!
 Rachel: I can’t. Please you do it for me.
 Rachel: Are you okay?
 Rachel: Oh God!
 Rachel: Oh she’s so tiny. (Starts crying) Where’d she go?
 Rachel: Okay. Well be careful with her she’s really tiny.
 Rachel: Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. (The baby cries.) I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh she’s looking at me. Hi! I know you.
 Rachel: No not yet.
 Rachel: Oh no Baby Girl Geller-Green.
 Rachel: Hello baby girl.
 Rachel: Here. (Hands her to Monica.)
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh nothing I… Sorry I just can’t stop crying.
 Rachel: So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don’t see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God. (Starts to cry harder.)
 Rachel: I was reliving it.
 Rachel: Yeah and y’know what? I love them both so why don’t you just pick one and that’ll be it.
 Rachel: That’s not her name! I’m sorry she just doesn’t feel like an Isabella.
 Rachel: Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
 Rachel: Well what are we going to do?
 Rachel: Well tell us! What are they?
 Rachel: And if it’s a girl?
 Rachel: Oh just tell us! We’re not gonna want it!
 Rachel: (gasps) Emma! (Looks at the baby and starts to cry.) See? I don’t want it.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: Oh honey but you love that name.
 Rachel: Ohhh! (Looks at Aaron and recoils in horror.) Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn’t he?
 Rachel: Oh I’m fine. (Gasps in pain as she sits down.)
 Rachel: Oh I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross.
 Rachel: Well then he gets a divorce it’s Ross!
 Rachel: Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.
 Rachel: Really?
 Rachel: Well… That’s…y’know—That’s—We’ve been alone for the last twenty minutes we’re doing okay. Besides y’know what? I-I—Maybe we won’t be alone ‘cause lately I-I—things have been happening between me and Ross y’know? Right before I went into labor we-we had this kiss. Y’know? So it might be the…the beginning of something.
 Rachel: Uh-huh. (Ross takes off his coat and sets in on a chair.) Y’know what I was I was thinking about?
 Rachel: Umm…that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?
 Rachel: (pause) Right.
 Rachel: No! No of course not. No. That’s why I brought it up. (Pause) They didn’t have any sodas?
 Rachel: That’s all right. (He goes to get her a soda.) And so it begins.
 Rachel: Nothing.
 Rachel: Really it’s nothing. I’m just…
 Rachel: I’ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
 Rachel: Oh please he’ll be with his real family the twins and little miss new boobs.
 Rachel: I’m just saying that y’know someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?
 Rachel: I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
 Rachel: Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
 Rachel: Oh hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They’re right on that chair under Ross’s coat.
 Rachel: Okay.
 Rachel: Joey.
 Rachel: (seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.
 Rachel: Joey.
 Rachel: (seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.
 Rachel: So uh…I guess we should…make it official huh?
 Rachel: Hey you.
 Rachel: Uh yeah actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
 Rachel: I know I still need to talk to you.
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: Uhh… I think I just got engaged.
 Rachel: Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?
 Rachel: And you really think this is a good idea?
 Rachel: I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.
 Rachel: Really?! Even Ross?
 Rachel: I guess so.
 Rachel: I can’t say that I’m surprised.
 Rachel: Of course! Oh Joey this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey why do you think she won’t take my breast?
 Rachel: Okay sweetie you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.
 Rachel: I’m sorry honey what were you saying?
 Rachel: Oh look she’s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesn’t she look scared?
 Rachel: It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!
 Rachel: Hey. I need to tell you something.
 Rachel: Joey asked me marry him.
 Rachel: Joey proposed to me.
 Rachel: Well I-I said yes.
 Rachel: I know. Days of Our Lives thank you very much.
 Rachel: Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
 Rachel: Sure.
 Rachel: Yeah I mean whatever.
 Rachel: No. No I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
 Rachel: Hey.
 Rachel: Surprised?
 Rachel: I know.
 Rachel: You didn’t propose to me. Joey did.
 Rachel: Uh… You didn’t propose to me Chandler didn’t propose to me but Joey did.
 Rachel: Yes you did!
 Rachel: Well then why did you give me a ring?
 Rachel: Yes you did!
 Rachel: Yes you did!
 Rachel: Yes you did! And don’t you say No I didn’t!
 Rachel: He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
 Rachel: Yeah what did happen?

 Rachel: I’m sorry what?
 Rachel: Okay you have to realize I was exhausted I was emotional I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! (Pause) I’m not helping.
 Rachel: That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
 Rachel: Well—Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
 Rachel: Ooooo!

 Rachel: Its impossible to find a good doctor. I mean how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?

 Rachel: What if she jumped out the bassinet?
 Rachel: Oh my god I left the water running.

 Rachel: Phoebe hi we�re so sorry. You�re totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.

 Rachel: Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... (theyre standing up and make their way to the door)
 Rachel: Really nice to meet you... and well call you.
 Rachel: Okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nannys face while Ross crumples up the application form) Wow! Were never gonna find a nanny.

 Rachel: Okay... (Ross opens the door.)
 Rachel: Sandy thats exactly what it is...
 Rachel: Ross!
 Rachel: Oh!
 Rachel: Oh thats pretty.
 Rachel: Oh God she mu... she must need her diaper changed.

 Rachel: Oooh... ***I really cant hear what she says*** come here.
 Rachel: (in a tearful voice) Oh... Oh boy... (she turns around and sees Ross) Hi...
 Rachel: Oh yeah its fine its fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful.
 Rachel: I cant... I cant hear it again.
 Rachel: Yeah! (to Sandy) Excuse me... (She walks to the kitchen with Ross and sighs)
 Rachel: Look Ross hes just... Sandy is just sensitive thats all.
 Rachel: What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
 Rachel: Sandy made Madeleines.
 Rachel: Well I... you know I-I-I dont know what to say... I mean I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know cause I gotta tell you Ross it not like you just came in from branding cattle.
 Rachel: Okay what? What is too sensitive? (Theres music coming from the living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and he and Rachel see Sandy play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved by this but Ross only sees his point proven again and walks back into the kitchen angrily. The door he was holding swings back and hits Rachel.)
 Rachel: That was kind of rude!
 Rachel: You know he was just doing his job...
 Rachel: Oh come on Ross...
 Rachel: (sighs) Oh... Thats true.
 Rachel: Well youre the one who wants to fire him so youre gonna have to do it. (Ross walks to the living room determined to fire Sandy)
 Rachel: I cant watch. Its like firing Elmo. (Ross walks to the couch where Sandy sits)
 Rachel: (from behind the bedroom door) YOU! You feel!
 Rachel: (from bedroom) Oh damn you Geller!
 Rachel: (from the bedroom) Huh ha ha!
 Rachel: Oh yeah she cant be herself.
 Rachel: Yeah totally! You are in such good hands. And Im so good with meeting parents. With the father you know you want to flirt a little bit but not in a gross way. Just kind of like Oh mr. Pincer I can see where Wallis gets his good looks...
 Rachel: Uh he took the SATs for me.
 Rachel: Ssshyeah well duh! I mean...
 Rachel: Oh with the mother just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me moms love me. Rosss mom one time actually said Im like the daughter that she never had.
 Rachel: Hi.
 Rachel: I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mikes parents. Shes so nervous its so sweet!
 Rachel: (in disbelief) You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
 Rachel: Well... well what did you do to make her laugh? (excited)
 Rachel: You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
 Rachel: (disgusted) owwwww...
 Rachel: Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy... (Rachel makes a funny face sticking her tongue out making a farting noise and using her hands as antlers wiggling her fingers... No response from Emma...) Not funny huh? Oh so is it... only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just you know rap in general? Cause mommy can rap... (Rachel tries to rap and makes weird movements with her arms in the process.) My name is mommy and Im here to say / that all the babies are... Oh I cant rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much and I know that youre not gonna tell anybody... (Rachels face is telling Oh what am I doing? The things I have to go through... and she starts to rap) I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers cant deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... (Emma starts to laugh) Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh!

Oh you are you really do like big butts dont you. Oh you beautiful little weirdo... (Rachel picks up Emma and Ross now enters)
 Rachel: Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful beautiful sound that...

 Rachel: Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
 Rachel: So fellas

 Rachel: Shake it! (Phoebe Mike Chandler Monica and Joey step in)
 Rachel: Shake that nasty butt...
 Rachel: One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie you other br... (She also turns and sees the gang)

 Rachel: See look Amy were a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey you dont seem very connected to the baby.
 Rachel: Monica is Ross sister.
 Rachel: Hey. Amy. Youve got to stop doing that.
 Rachel: Well actually...
 Rachel: Honey youre taking this the wrong way. We think youre going to be a wonderful parent. Its just.. youre more the fun parent.
 Rachel: UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amys>
 Rachel: Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didnt give you my baby?
 Rachel: What? What carrer?
 Rachel: Ok. You decorate dads office and so now youre a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now Im a koala bear.

 Rachel: I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why Im not giving Emily to you.
 Rachel: uh huh.
 Rachel: Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You your immaturity? Your total disregard of other peoples feelings?

 Rachel: Chandler arent you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
 Rachel: Chandler thats not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present two medium presents and a bunch of little presents? And youve just gotten her one great present? I mean thats just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
 Rachel: Thats right!

 Rachel: Im the hell person whose office this is!
 Rachel: Excuse me?
 Rachel: Wait a minute! What do you mean youre taking over my job?

 Rachel: Alright! Dont get too comfortable there because Im back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I cant say that I care too much for the way youve rearranged my office. 
 Rachel: Excuse me?

 Rachel: Fine I will. (Pushes that button thing on the chair that makes it collapse) Alright fill me in! 
 Rachel: Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes but I think Im caught up on everything. So ask me anything!
 Rachel: Except that! (Mr. Zelner enters) Oh hello Mr. Zelner. Were all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
 Rachel: What? I cant do that! I have the baby and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.
 Rachel: Well there you go. You win you win. You get to do the presentation youll knock em dead no one will ever remember that I worked here and then Ralph will buy his helicopter and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!

 Rachel: Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what hey new day new leaf I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) Im sorry obviously Heathers ass has something more important to say so Ill just wait till its finished.
 Rachel: I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
 Rachel: Oh wow you are really youre really a creep.
 Rachel: Oh yeah Im jealous. Oh Gavin please please look at my ass. (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean I just think you are totally inappropriate ok? This is a work environment shes your subordinate.
 Rachel: That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didnt know that you knew that. And two I wasnt some creep staring at his ass we had a deap meaningful relationship.
 Rachel: It was ... (cant remember) oh my god. He didnt have a last name. It was just Tag. You know like Cher or you know Moses.
 Rachel: Oh you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tags last name was Morgan! Huh!
 Rachel: Yeah well what are you his boyfriend?

 Rachel: Bye!
 Rachel: Hey!
 Rachel: You guys arent doing anything tonight are you?
 Rachel: I was just asking cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.

 Rachel: Oh oh no. Do you think she walked in saw you and left?
 Rachel: Well if it makes you feel any better I wish my date hadnt shown up.
 Rachel: Well he makes t-shirts for a living and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.
 Rachel: Oh. Huh. You know it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didnt even show.
 Rachel: (entering) Joey! You never gonna believe it she called. 
 Rachel: (enthusiastic) You got it!
 Rachel: Your agent called. You got that audition.
 Rachel: Yes.
 Rachel: Yeah and Lennart Haze is starring in it…
 Rachel: (disbelieving) You saw that?
 Rachel: Oh yeah. Oh I loved him in those cell phone commercials. 
 Rachel: Oh anything yet?
 Rachel: Joey that was formula.
 Rachel: Okay first of all thats stupid and second of all Im not allowed to talk to Ralph. 
 Rachel: Hi you guys!
 Rachel: Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
 Rachel: No. I was just going to do this myself. (Joey makes a sarcastic laugh.)
 Rachel: Yeah Why? You dont think a woman can do this?
 Rachel: Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
 Rachel: Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
 Rachel: There is a hardware store right down the street?
 Rachel: This is easy...Cant do this! (Moves away...and finds her sweater sleeve stuck to the drawer) Oh! Wow! Seriously I cant do this. (Fiddles more)
 Rachel: Hi!
 Rachel: Yeah I dont know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
 Rachel: Oh thank you so much. (Picks up the guys spirit level) Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game. (hands it to him)
 Rachel: Dont look at me I never get his jokes.
 Rachel: Just when you thought that dude couldnt get any wierder.
 Rachel: I dont know! I mean what brought that on?
 Rachel: No you really think thats what it is?
 Rachel: Yeah! If you dont I will! Of course your bodys gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger your ass is gonna get bigger youre gonna lose bladder control. (she starts sobbing) God! Its just such a magical time!
 Rachel: Argh. fascist
 Rachel: Man dont be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
 Rachel: Oh my god Chandler! If you cant handle this what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present thats shooting out of her!?
 Rachel: Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
 Rachel: Yeah seriously coz this is really heavy. (She suddenly lets go) I mean not for me because im only pretending to hold this but for these guys.
 Rachel: Im so sorry Pheebs.
 Rachel: Hey! How was basketball?
 Rachel: Oh no! Who did that?
 Rachel: She was just crawling around and she found him so I just let her sleep with him. Thats all right? Isnt it?
 Rachel: Joey... are you sure? I mean I know how much you love him!
 Rachel: All right... Oh Emma loves him!
 Rachel: (threatening Joey with a scrunchy) Step away from the crib I have a weapon!
 Rachel: What are you doing?
 Rachel: Oh oh thanks. Alright well now that Im up Im going to go to the bathroom.
 Rachel: Joey Emmas right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
 Rachel: Oh thats so great now Emma has two Hugsys.
 Rachel: Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much I took her everywhere I would braid her tail...
 Rachel: Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I cant find it?
 Rachel: Oh I dont think she likes the new Hugsy.
 Rachel: Yeah I think she wants the old one back.
 Rachel: Joey come on!
 Rachel: Im trying to put Emma down for a nap have you seen Hugsy?
 Rachel: Original.
 Rachel: Then whats that big lump under your covers?
 Rachel: Thats not Monica!
 Rachel: (to herself) Oh God.
 Rachel: (yelling) Joey there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsys ears) Oh dont cover its ears! (stops yelling) Its because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!
 Rachel: Yeah! And shes comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
 Rachel: Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy dont worry. Emma will totally understand. I wont... but whatever (She leaves the room).
 Rachel: Oooh... youre sweet I knew uncle Joey would step up. (Turns to face Emma in the the playpen) Look Emma look whos baaack!
 Rachel: Are you gonna... youre going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
 Rachel: Oh! So youre driving up to Connecticut?
 Rachel: Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why dont we all pitch in 50 bucks well pool our money together and then if we win well split it!
 Rachel: Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
 Rachel: Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what Im saying.

 Rachel: Well theres two spots left right?
 Rachel: Oh no Im good I dont wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.

 Rachel: Ooh you guys it starts in like 20 minutes.
 Rachel: Ooh I have another idea!
 Rachel: Well well well look what mommy found!!
 Rachel: Ok well Monica suppose one of your special tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
 Rachel: Chandler would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
 Rachel: All right believe me.If you win the lottery its the last youre gonna hear from us!
 Rachel: (surprised) OH! Alright you know what? Thats it! I want my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!
 Rachel: Ok thats it! Just giveem to me! Ill split them up! (she tries to snatch the bowl from Joeys hands but she cant so she pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)
 Rachel: Oh if she jumps I get her tickets.
 Rachel: Oh it is so unfair. Its like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.
 Rachel: No she was just much better at job than me!
 Rachel: (To Ross) You know what? We should call my mums house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.

 Rachel: (searching the dictionary) Alright okay okay gleba gleba... (excited) Gleba! Ha! Here it is the fleshy spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.
 Rachel: You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
 Rachel: What?
 Rachel: So Pheebs what are you going to do with your $3?
 Rachel: Me too.
 Rachel: I dont wanna stand in the way of true love or anything but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less.
