[Scene: Chandler's office in Tulsa.�� His assistant is showing him photographs.]

JO LYNN: This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.

CHANDLER: Yep.� That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn.� Single are ya?

(Phone rings.� Chandler answers using the speaker phone.)

CHANDLER: Chandler Bing.

JOEY: Hey.� How come you're answering your own phone?� Where's your crazy assistant?

(She frowns.� Chandler picks up the hand set.)

CHANDLER: What's up Joe?

JOEY: Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?

CHANDLER: Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?

JOEY: No, no, no.� When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . .� courtside!

CHANDLER: Courtside?� Oh my God.

JOEY: Yeah.� Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.

CHANDLER: That's so cool.� I'll let Monica know.

(Chandler hangs up and calls Monica who is reading a book on their sofa as the phone rings.)

MONICA: Hello?

CHANDLER: Joey just called.� He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.

MONICA: Really?� But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant.� If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.

CHANDLER: But hey, it's courtside.� The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . . (Pause)� That's not the way to convince you.

MONICA: Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You can't go to the game.� You have to spend time with me."� So, if you could just realize it on your own . . .

CHANDLER: I know.� You're right.� I want to see you too.� I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know?� He's really looking forward to this.

MONICA: Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.� Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.� Tell him that what little time we have is precious.

CHANDLER: Yeah, ah, ah . . .� I'll think of something.

[ OPENING CREDITS ]

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.� Ross is in the living room covering Emma.� Rachel enters wearing a sexy dress.]

ROSS: Wow!� (pause)� Wow, You look . . . uh . . .�� It's just, ah . . .�� That dress . . . uh . . .�

RACHEL: Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.

ROSS: Well, well, they're good.� It's been a while since I've seen you like this.� You, you clean up good.

RACHEL: Oh well, well thank you.� (She laughs.� He stares for a moment.)� Okay, stop.� Stop looking at me like that.� The last time that happened, (points to Ross) that happened.� (points to Emma.)

ROSS: Oh right, right.� (They pause and exchange a glance. Then, Ross looks away.)� So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?

RACHEL: Yeah, yeah.� Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun.� And thank you for watching the baby, by the way.

ROSS: Oh, it's fine.� Actually, I, I invited Mike over.

RACHEL: Phoebe's Mike?

ROSS: Yeah.

RACHEL: I didn't know you guys hung out.

ROSS: We don't.� But I thought it would be nice to get to know him.� You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.

RACHEL: Oh that's so cute:� Ross and Mike's first date.� Is that going to be awkward?� I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?

ROSS: I don't know.� But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.� He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.� He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.

(Rachel nods.� There is a knock on the door.)

RACHEL: Yeah.

(Phoebe and Mike enter.)

PHOEBE: Hi

RACHEL: Hey.

PHOEBE: (spotting Rachel's dress) Oooh.� Girl's night out indeed.

RACHEL: (to Ross) Ok.� So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything Ross . . .

ROSS: Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right?� You go have fun.

RACHEL: Okay.� You too.� And I hope you score.� (to Mike) Bye.

MIKE: Bye.

ROSS: So . . .� Welcome.

MIKE: (Holds up a six pack of Foster's Lager) I got beer.

ROSS: I got bottled breast milk.

MIKE: Eh, why don't we start with the beer?

ROSS: Okay.� (They sit.)� So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.

MIKE: Yeah.

ROSS: You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.

MIKE: Ah?� (pause)� Do you have one here?

ROSS: No.

MIKE: Okay.� (pause)

(They clink beer bottles, and drink.� Then, they stare uncomfortably at their bottles.)

ROSS: Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced.� Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe said you . . . You've been divorced?

MIKE: Yeah.� (pause)� Yeah, I'm sorry.� I don't . . . I don't really like to talk about it.

ROSS: (pause) That's okay.� We'll talk about (pause) something else.� (They pause.� They drink.)

MIKE:� So, you're a paleontologist, right?

ROSS: Yeah.

MIKE: My cousin's a paleontologist.

ROSS: Ah?� (Mike nods.� Another pause.)� Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.

[Scene:� Monica and Chandler's apartment.� Monica is wearing a sexy negligee.� She pours two glasses of wine as Chandler enters with a carry-on suitcase.� He sets the case by the door.)

MONICA: Hi.

CHANDLER: Hey.

MONICA: Welcome home.

CHANDLER: (Hangs his jacket over the suitcase, locks the door, then turns to Monica.)� Oh well, look at you.

MONICA: Yeah.� What do you think?

CHANDLER: Well, it looks great.� It's just that . . . well, I'm wearing the same thing underneath.� So . . .

MONICA: Oh.

CHANDLER: See what I mean . . . (They kiss.)

(There is a loud thud at the door.)

JOEY: Hey!� How come the door's locked?

MONICA: Just a second.

CHANDLER: (hushed) No, no, no, no, no.� Joey can't know that I'm here.

MONICA: Why not?

CHANDLER: Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks game.� So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.

MONICA: So, you lied to him?

CHANDLER: Achhh.� It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.� (pause)� Except with you.

JOEY: Hey!� Open the door.� What's going on?� (He knocks.)

(Monica goes to the door.� Chandler slides behind it as she opens it slightly.)

JOEY: What are you . ..� (He sees her in her negligee.)� Why are you dressed like that?

MONICA: Oh, because, um . . .� well, Chandler's going to be home in a couple of days.� So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction.

JOEY: Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before.

MONICA: Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.� You know, like, "Hi, How do I look?"� (As Chandler) "Really sexy.� Could I BE any more turned on?"

JOEY: Okay.� (pause.� He looks over her shoulder at the table with the wine.)� Whoa, whoa.� Why are there two glasses of wine out?

MONICA: Because. . .� one of them is for you.

(Monica turns to get the wine.� Chandler peeps through the peephole.� Joey, seeing something, peeps back.� Chandler ducks.� Monica returns with two glasses of wine.� She gives one to Joey.)

MONICA: Cheers.� (She clinks his glass and pulls back.)� Okay, buh-bye.� (She closes the door.)

CHANDLER: You know, it's funny.� I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction myself.� (He raises his hands in front of himself, sticks out his behind, and wiggles it.)� Hi ya.

MONICA: You might want to keep practicing.

CHANDLER: Yah.

(Chandler's cell phone rings.� He looks at it.)

CHANDLER: It's Joey.� (He answers it, holding it out so that Monica can hear too.)� Hey Joe.

JOEY: Dude, come home!

CHANDLER: What? Why?

JOEY: COME . . .� HOME.

CHANDLER: Look I, I can't.� What's going on?

JOEY: I don't know how to tell you this but, uh . . . I think Monica's cheatin' on ya.� I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.

(Chandler and Monica look at each other.� Chandler nods.)

JOEY: All right look.� (He walks to the hallway.)� If you can't come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna.

CHANDLER: NO!

JOEY: (outside the apartment door) I just heard him!

CHANDLER: (softly) Can you . . . hear him . . . now?

JOEY: (listens at the door.)� No.� (pause) All right, I'm going in.

CHANDLER: No! Wait!

JOEY: I heard him again!

CHANDLER: (writhes as if in agony) All right, look.� Just stay there.� I'm coming home.

JOEY: Okay.� Great.� I'll see you when you get here.� I'm gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.

CHANDLER: Is that really necessary?

JOEY: Absolutely.� You'd do it for me.� Not that you ever have to because I know how to keep my women satisfied.

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.� Mike is blowing a note from his beer bottle.� Ross stares off to the side.)

ROSS: Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?� I mean, they said thirty minutes or less.� Well, how long has it been?

MIKE: (looking at his watch) Eleven minutes.� (long pause)� And now twelve.� So, do you like the beer?

ROSS: I do.� I do.� Although, it's actually a lager.

MIKE: huh.� (pause)� What's the difference between beer and lager?

ROSS: I don't know.� We could look it up.

MIKE: (nods) Things are about to get wild.

[Scene: A bar.� Rachel and Phoebe are bringing their drinks from the bar to a sofa.]

PHOEBE: Oh God.� Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross?

RACHEL: Oh God.� It seems like forever ago.

PHOEBE: I know.� (sighs)�� So, what's going on with you and Ross?

RACHEL: Well, um . . . I don't know.� I mean, for a long time nothing.� But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah . . . little thing.

PHOEBE: Oh my God!� I love things.� What happened?

RACHEL: Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked.� And, ah, then we had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.

PHOEBE: Eye-contact?

RACHEL: Mm-hmm.

PHOEBE: I hope you were using protection.

WAITER: (with tray and two drinks)� Excuse me.� Um, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.

RACHEL: Oh.� (to Phoebe) Should we send them something back?

PHOEBE: Oooh.� Let's do.� Let's send them mashed potatoes.

RACHEL: No!� Wait!� No, no.� Don't do that!� That's going to make them think they can come over here.

PHOEBE: So?� What if they do?

RACHEL: Well, we're not here to meet guys.� You have a boyfriend, I have a b. . . baby and a Ross.

PHOEBE: Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen.� We're just having fun.� You know, not everything had to go as far as "eye-contact."

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment.� Chandler is seated in the chair and Monica stands behind the sofa.]

MONICA: Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.

CHANDLER: Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?� (Monica tips her head slightly as if asking "Did you hear yourself?")� I heard it.

MONICA: I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.

CHANDLER: All right.� I've got a plan.� I'll go down the fire escape.

MONICA: Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."

CHANDLER: Hear me out woman.� I'll go down the fire escape.� Then, I'll wait for a while.� Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa.� Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.

MONICA: Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out?� (pause)� I heard it.

(Chandler runs to the window, opens it, starts out, but returns, casually walking back to his chair.)

CHANDLER: I'm just going to wait for a little while.

MONICA: Scary pigeon's back?

CHANDLER: It's huge.

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.� Three pizza crusts, two bottle caps and the plastic tripod are left in the otherwise empty pizza box.� Mike is making hollow popping noises with his mouth.� He begins to speak, but stops and pops his lips a few more times and takes a drink.� Ross smiles as if he has thought of something to say, but then he stops and sinks back in a slump on the sofa.]

[Scene: The bar.� Two men are chatting with Rachel and Phoebe.]

RACHEL: Oh my God.� I can't believe you live in that building.� My grandmother lives in that building.� Ida Green?� No sense of personal space?� Kind of smells like chicken?� Looks like a potato.

BILL: "Spuds" is your grandmother?

RACHEL: That's my bubby!

KEVIN: So, we're on our way to a couple of parties.� Um. . . maybe we can get your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.

PHOEBE: Yeah. . . I'm sorry.� We weren't really looking for anything to happen with you guys.� I, I have a boyfriend.


KEVIN: All right. It's no big deal.

BILL: So, she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?

RACHEL: Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend.� But um. . .

BILL: Then, can I have your number?

RACHEL: (pause) I'm sorry, no.

BILL: Okay. (They start to walk away.)

RACHEL: Oh sure.� (She pulls a business card from her purse and writes on it.)

PHOEBE: (Reading the card.) Oh my God, you're giving your real number.

BILL: Okay, thanks. I'll give you a call later tonight.

RACHEL: Great.

BILL: Bye

PHOEBE: Bye. (The guys leave.) Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?

RACHEL: I don't know.� He was cute, and he liked me.� It was an impulse.

PHOEBE: What about Ross?� What about your moment?� Don't you want to talk to Ross about it?

RACHEL: No.� No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go.� "Hey Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."

RACHEL: (lowers voice to imitate Ross) "Yeah."� (Clears throat.)� "Me too."

RACHEL: (as herself) "Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it."

RACHEL: (as Ross) "Yeah."� (Clears throat twice.) "Me neither." (Clears throat again.)

RACHEL: (as herself) "Well, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we're really feeling?"

RACHEL: (as Ross) "Yeah.� That works for me." (Clears throat twice more.)

PHOEBE: Yeah, I see what you mean.� By the way, nice Ross imitation.

RACHEL: Oh, thanks.

PHOEBE: But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.

RACHEL: (whining) Wha. . . hey!

PHOEBE: (pointing) Better!

RACHEL: Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know?� I should just . . . move on with my life.

PHOEBE: Really?� You're moving on from Ross?

RACHEL: I don't know.� Do I have to decide right now?

PHOEBE: Well, you kind of just did.� That guy is going to call you tonight.� Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.

RACHEL: Oh God, Ross.� Ross is going to pick up the phone.� Oh, I have to get my number back.� (She turns to find Bill, but they have gone.)� Oh my God.� He's gone.

PHOEBE: (imitating Rachel) "Oh, I have to get my number back.� Oh my God.� He's gone."� (smiles) Dead on.

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.� Ross and Mike are sitting on the sofa.� Ross is fidgeting with the cuff of his sweater while Mike blows his cheeks out.� Ross blows a piece of fuzz from his finger.)

MIKE: (releases a whoosh of air) Ya know, I'm going to take off.

ROSS: So soon?

MIKE: Well, yeah.

ROSS: Okay.� Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.

MIKE: Ah, you mean lager.

ROSS: Ah yeah.� Good times.

(Mike leaves.� Ross closes the door behind him.)

MIKE: (In the hall, relieved) Oh.

(Ross, inside the door, releases a sign of relief.� Back in the hall, Mike's cell phone rings.)

MIKE: Hello?

PHOEBE: (calling from the bar on her cell phone.) Hey, Mike, it's me.� Listen, is um, is Ross near you?

MIKE: Uh, no.� I just left.

PHOEBE: Well, you have to go back in.

MIKE: Wha . . .?� Go back?� To the "land where time stands still"?

PHOEBE: I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and, um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.� So, you have to intercept all his calls.

MIKE: I can't do that!

PHOEBE: (to Rachel) He says he can't do that.

RACHEL: Oh give me , , ,� (Phoebe gives Rachel the phone.)� Hi, Mike?� Hi.� Listen.� I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what?� If you do this I . . . Phoebe will . . . do anything you want.� Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.

PHOEBE: All right. (She takes the phone from Rachel.)� Hello?� Hi.� I'm sorry about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.

MIKE: All right.� I'll do it.� (Phoebe gives the thumbs-up sign to Rachel.)� But really, how much dirtier can it get?

PHOEBE: (knowingly chuckles) Oh, Mike.� Bye.

(Mike knocks on Ross's door.� Ross opens it.)

MIKE: Hey buddy.

ROSS: Uh, hi.

MIKE: Um, can I come back in?

ROSS: (putting his arm up with his hand on the door frame.)� Why?� (He starts to lower his arm.)

MIKE: (Entering the apartment) I, I was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about.

ROSS: (whining) But you left.

[Scene: The hallway and stairs outside Chandler and Monica's apartment.� Chandler enters from the stairs.� Joey is sitting with a baseball bat.]

JOEY: Wow!� That didn't take long.� I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.

CHANDLER: (pause) Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.

(Joey thinks a moment. Then, he nods.� Joey follows Chandler into the apartment.)

MONICA: (gasp) Chandler!� You're home!

CHANDLER: That's right.� You're husband's home.� So, now the sex can stop.

(Joey gives him and odd look.� Monica gives a similar look.)

MONICA: What are you saying?

CHANDLER: Joey said that you're in here with another man.

MONICA: There's no man in here.� How dare you accuse me of that.� (She slaps Chandler.)

JOEY: All right.� All right.� Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh?� (He checks the bathroom shaking the bat.� Then he proceeds to their bedroom.)� Bwa-ah-ah!

(Thudding sounds can be heard from the bedroom.)

CHANDLER: (To Monica) What is he doing?

MONICA: (smiling) I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.

JOEY: (emerging) Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.

CHANDLER: All right.� Well, I'll check the guest room.

JOEY: (sniffing the air and then Monica.)� Why do I smell men's cologne?

MONICA: (sniffing Joey) I think that's you.

JOEY: (sniffs his shirt.)� Oh yeah.� I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.

CHANDLER: There's nobody here Joe.

JOEY: I guess not.

MONICA: I can't believe you thought I was cheating.� (pointing at Joey) You own me an apology.

JOEY: Yeah, right Monica.� I'm so sorry.

MONICA: (suddenly starts issuing him out) Ah, it's an honest mistake.� It could happen to anyone.� All right, see ya.

JOEY: (spots the suitcase just inside the door where Chandler left it) Whoa, whoa.� Wait a minute.� Wait a minute.� If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?

CHANDLER: (thinks, then turns to Monica) I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment.� Mike is reading from a book.]

MIKE: So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing.� Fascinating isn't it.

ROSS: Maybe you should look up "fascinating."

(Phone rings.)

MIKE: I'll get it.� (He lunges across Ross's lap on the sofa to reach the phone.� Ross stares at him with wide eyes.)� Hello?� Ross's place.� Mike speaking.� (pause.� Hands phone to Ross)� It's for you.

ROSS: (takes the phone, but speaks to Mike) I don't understand what just happened here.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment " continuing action.]

JOEY: What's going on?

CHANDLER: I'm sorry.� I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . .� I didn't think you'd understand.

JOEY: What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife?� Huh?� Do you think I'm like, "Duh."� (He strikes himself in the head with the bat.� He stands dazed for a moment.)

MONICA: Joey?

JOEY: Yeah?� (His eyes bug out.)

MONICA: I don't know what to say.� We shouldn't have lied to you.

CHANDLER: Yeah.� I feel so bad.� Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?

JOEY: (pause) Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't.� But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.

CHANDLER: I'm sorry. �That's the one thing I can't do.� I promised I'd be with Monica.

JOEY: All right.

MONICA: (taps chandler on the arm) You can go.

CHANDLER: What?

MONICA: You should go to the game.� It's okay.� I want you to.

CHANDLER: Really?� You're gonna be okay?

MONICA: Yeah, I'll be fine.� You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the art of seduction.

CHANDLER: You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?

MONICA: It's gonna be so hot!� (She kisses him.)

CHANDLER: Okay, bye.

MONICA: Have fun.

JOEY: Thanks.� (Joey and Chandler exit to the hall.� Joey pulls out the tickets and hands one to Chandler.)� Here's your ticket.

CHANDLER: Hey, listen.� I'm never going to lie to you again, okay?� And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.

JOEY: Thanks man.

(Chandler heads toward the stairs, but makes a turn back to his apartment while looking at the ticket.)

JOEY: Where are you going?

CHANDLER: Game's tomorrow night Joe.

MIKE: No.� Just his mom.

RACHEL: Oh, around 8:30?

MIKE: Yeah.

RACHEL: Yeah.

(Inside the apartment the phone rings.� Ross answers it.)

ROSS: Hello.� (listens)� Ah, no, she's not here right now.� Can I take a message?� (grabs a pad and pen)� Bill from the bar?� (writes)� Okay, "Bill from the bar."� I'll make sure she gets your number.

(He hangs up the phone and tears the note off the pad.� Then, he stops and re-reads it.� Rachel enters.)

RACHEL: Aaah.� (She goes to tend Emma.)

ROSS: So, ah . . . So, how was it?�� Uh, did you guys. . . Did you guys have a good time?

RACHEL: Oh, it was so much fun.� It felt so good to be out.
