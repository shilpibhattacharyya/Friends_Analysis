I am a huge fan of the TV sitcom 'F.R.I.E.N.D.S' and recently I have been wanting to analyze the primary characters on the show. When I went on internet looking for available datasets, I got transcripts for all the seasons, which has been created by people. So, I wanted to do some text mining on these transcripts. And this series is my journey to accomplish this project. I hope everyone out there interested to explore datasets as this would find it helpful. To begin with, I took all the season1 transcripts and saved the .html files as .csv files and merged all the episodes into a single transcript as per the following code.
